From his vibrant Mexico, to his beautifully structured harmonies in Lighthouse, and the unique title cut Gorilla, Taylor's album has the intimate feel that only truly gifted musicians can achieve. Close your eyes and you're in a dimly lit coffee house listening to his musical poetry. The depth of his songs compared to what passes for music today is a breath of fresh air. Well worth the money to add this to your collection, or to rebuy it if your's is an old and worn copy as is mine.\n\n\t  1. Mexico (LP Version)\n\t  2. Music (LP Version)\t\n\t  3.
