The story was considered a hoaxÃ¢â‚¬â€but now Juan Cabrillo and his Oregon colleagues arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t so sure.\n\nThere is talk of a new weapon soon to be auctioned, something very dangerous to AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interests, and the rumors link it to the great inventor Nikola Tesla, who was\nworking with the Navy when he died in 1943. Was he responsible for the experiment? Are his notes in the hands of enemies? As Cabrillo races to find the truth, he discovers there is even more at stake than he could have imaginedÃ¢â‚¬â€but by the time he realizes it, he may already be too late.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8bb0335bd9cbd9de921a6352f6e7576b40e5c03","amp;dn":"Mirage+-+Clive+Cussler.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8bb0335bd9cbd9de921a6352f6e7576b40e5c03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,187,3,53,189,156,189,157,233,33,166,53,47,110,117,118,180,14,92,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
