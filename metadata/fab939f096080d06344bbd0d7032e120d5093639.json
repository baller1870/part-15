For the initial \n            release we used the main ending on the disc, AKA &quot;The Trilogy \n            Ending&quot;. The disc offers 3 additional alternative endings and we \n            thought it would be nice to make them available as well. Naturally  \n            it would be stupid to pre the movie 4 times each resoltion, so we \n            instead encoded the 3 extra endings on their own.\n\n            One can watch the full release and the different endings after \n            (the endings are from 1h19m0s), or use our merge script to create\n            full versions of the movie, each with a different ending. We didn't\n            size the endings to a specific target size, but used the same\n            bitrate that was used for the full release to keep it consistent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fab939f096080d06344bbd0d7032e120d5093639","amp;dn":"Clue.1985.Alternative.Endings.720p.BluRay.X264-AMIABLE+%5BPublicHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fab939f096080d06344bbd0d7032e120d5093639","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,185,57,240,150,8,13,6,52,75,189,13,112,50,225,32,213,9,54,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
