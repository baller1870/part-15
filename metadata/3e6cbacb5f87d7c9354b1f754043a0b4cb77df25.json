Frustrated and lonely, Etto is faced with the seemingly impossible prospect of cobbling together the remaining pieces of his life, including his mostly nonexistent relationship with his father, the town butcher.\n\nThings begin to change for Etto when Yuri Fil, a scandal-ridden Ukrainian soccer star and his tough-love sister, Zhuki, arrive in town, and sweep him into their universe of soccer, celebrity, laughter, and fierce loyalty. \n\nUnder their influence, Etto begins to reconstruct his relationship with his father and learns a few life lessons: that perhaps the game of soccer isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just a waste of timeÃ¢â‚¬â€and that San Benedetto, his father, love, and life itself might have more to offer him than he ever believed possible.\n\nGenre: General Fiction/Classics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e6cbacb5f87d7c9354b1f754043a0b4cb77df25","amp;dn":"The+Sun+and+Other+Stars+by+Brigid+Pasulka","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e6cbacb5f87d7c9354b1f754043a0b4cb77df25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,108,186,203,95,135,215,201,53,75,31,117,64,67,160,180,203,119,223,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
