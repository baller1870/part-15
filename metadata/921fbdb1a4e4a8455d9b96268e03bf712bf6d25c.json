Then Carson can go back to waiting tables and being productively bitter about his life. He didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t count on finding a dead body in StassyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bed, and he certainly didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t count on the guy in the flip-flops and cutoffs at the local cafÃƒÂ© helping him get to the bottom of the crime.\n\nBut Dale Arden is no ordinary surfing burnoutÃ¢â‚¬â€heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actually a pretty sharp guy with a seductive voice and a bossy streak wider than the Florida panhandle. When he decides to boss Carson right into his bed, Carson realizes Stassy's not the only one who's been lost. Carson likes to think heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got his life all figured out, that sex with guys is your basic broom-closet transaction; he may just have to revise his priorities, because nobody plans on taking a left at St. Truth-be-Well and finding love at the Bates Parrot Hotel.\nGenre: MM Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:921fbdb1a4e4a8455d9b96268e03bf712bf6d25c","amp;dn":"Amy+Lane+-+Left+on+St.+Truth-Be-Well.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"921fbdb1a4e4a8455d9b96268e03bf712bf6d25c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,31,189,177,164,228,168,69,93,155,150,38,142,3,191,113,43,246,210,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
