Push comes to shove as Andy finds himself out of work and lugging luggage around at a hotel when he's suddenly approached to attend a &quot;Fan-Cruise&quot; with a bunch of sci-fi nerds who are still obsessed with his now obsolete series. As you can imagine he finds it very difficult to refuse the offer, even though it'll mean tolerating the high-and-mighty antics of not only Nick, but also the cruise coordinator Lurky (Walliams).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0335f932a37c38c7550288d9bd7bcf2c69dc87b7","amp;dn":"Cruise+Of+The+Gods+%282002%29+Steve+Coogan+Rob+Brydon+David+Walliams","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0335f932a37c38c7550288d9bd7bcf2c69dc87b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,53,249,50,163,124,56,199,85,2,136,217,189,123,207,44,105,220,135,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
