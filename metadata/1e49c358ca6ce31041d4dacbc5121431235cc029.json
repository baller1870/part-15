The talented technician's cutting edge sets contain the very best in upfront club driven music with the emphasis always on energy and the unexpected. A DJ that likes to take risks, do things differently, and loves to surprise clubbers across the globe with exclusive edits. \n\nHis production career started by him teaming up with John O'Callaghan for the track &quot;estricted Motion&quot;. This was instantly signed to Discover Records by label boss John Askew. The formidable duo's instant studio connection culminated in further tracks including &quot;The Temple&quot;, &quot;Pendulum&quot; and the seminal &quot;Exactly&quot; which became one of the biggest tracks of 2006......\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                        INDECENT NOISE\n                        --------------\n___________________________________________\n\nIndecent Noise (320Kbps) 187 Track 22:51:06\n-------------------------------------------\n\nRemixes\n\nSingles\n\nTracks\n\n\n\n\nIndecent Noise (Aleksander Stawierej) is a 26 years old DJ, producer, engineer and promoter hailing from Warsaw in Poland. His sound is completely rapt in energetic and melodic trance sounds which can often use etcher sounds to deliver devastating impact. Playing live Indecent Noise fully uses the benefits of technology by using laptop and midi controllers with Ableton Live making his sets special and unique. His fascination of electronic music started at a very young age and at age 7 he was already listening to compilations from Jan Michelle Jarre and Kraftwerk. It was in 2004 he decided to learn how to become a producer himself.\n \nHis first releases in 2006 where remixes of Viscid's tracks that were released on &quot;J00F Deep&quot; and &quot;Inaspace&quot;. Over the next year he improved his ability and skills gaining experience in production and signing contracts with Neuroscience Recordings and Kerf Music and certainly a turning point in his career was winning a remix competition which was organised by Communicate Recordings in 2008......\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________\nNotes:\nWe must have missed something, so maybe this collection before, \nbut we called her discography.\nThanks to all who are responsible for this.\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n\nVOILA !!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e49c358ca6ce31041d4dacbc5121431235cc029","amp;dn":"BRYAN+KEARNEY+and+INDECENT+NOISE+-+DISCOGRAPHY+%282012%29+Mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e49c358ca6ce31041d4dacbc5121431235cc029","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,73,195,88,202,108,227,16,65,212,218,203,197,18,20,49,35,92,192,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
