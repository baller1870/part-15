Throughout America, there were numbers of teenage girls dressing like Lauper and using &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot; as an anthem, a call to arms for self-expression.\n\n(font: allmusic)\n\n&quot;Live In Paris&quot; is the first live video album, thrown in 1987 in VHS with base in the show in Paris during True Colors World Tour.\n\n------\nVariable Bit Rate (Extreme)\n48 KHz\n16 bit\n------\n\nTracks:\n\n1- Change of Heart\n2- The Goonies 'R' Good Enough&quot;Boy Blue\n3- All Through the Night\n4- What's Going On\n5- Iko Iko\n6- She Bop\n7- Calm Inside the Storm\n8- 911\n9- One Track Mind\n10- True Colors\n11- Maybe He'll Know\n12- Time After Time\n13- Money Changes Everything\n14- Girls Just Want to Have Fun\n15- Baby Workout\n16- True Colors (suite) \n\n------\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:808119eef76f328afae58e7b67f6d5ed770d4390","amp;dn":"Cyndi+Lauper+-+Live+In+Paris+-+True+Colors+Tour%2C+1987","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"808119eef76f328afae58e7b67f6d5ed770d4390","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,129,25,238,247,111,50,138,250,229,142,123,103,246,213,237,119,13,67,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
