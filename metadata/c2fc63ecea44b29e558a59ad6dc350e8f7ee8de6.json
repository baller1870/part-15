When you are ready to animate, press the Record button on the animation timeline. Then, pick up the prop you want to animate first and move it aroundâ€”you'll notice the animation timeline starts to capture every detail of your movements in real-time. When you've finished capturing, you can scroll the animation timeline backwardsâ€”to the beginning or any point in betweenâ€”and start moving another prop. With each new motion, you begin to layer the animation towards becoming its very own story!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2fc63ecea44b29e558a59ad6dc350e8f7ee8de6","amp;dn":"Tvori","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2fc63ecea44b29e558a59ad6dc350e8f7ee8de6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,252,99,236,234,68,178,158,85,138,89,173,109,195,80,232,247,238,141,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
