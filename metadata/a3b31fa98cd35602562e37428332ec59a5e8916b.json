In each case, the death turns out to be a murder, and Jackie tracks down the suspects:\n\nSeries 1 - A famous Shakespearean academic is run over and killed on hios way back from a lunchtime drink;\n\nSeries 2- A political activist apparently commits suicide on a preserved railway line;\n\nSeries 3 - A young woman is found dead after apparently falling down stairs on her way to work. But why is she dressed for a wedding?\n\nSeries 4 - A young man is found dead in a canal\n\nSeries 5 - The sister in law of a known criminal is kidnapped.\n\nWhat makes these interesting is that in each case, the stories are not black and white, the victim not blameless and the murderer not evil.
