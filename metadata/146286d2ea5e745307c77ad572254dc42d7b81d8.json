Works with external GPS kit for iPod touch and iPhone.\n\nThe accuracy of the navigation instruments is better when the iPhone has a clear view of the sky (near the front cockpit for ex.). It may take 1 to 3 minutes to acquire a good GPS signal..\n\nPlease note that this software is not intended to replace a certified navigation device. You should always use official aeronautical documentation when preparing and performing a flight. You should always use certified navigation devices when performing a flight.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:146286d2ea5e745307c77ad572254dc42d7b81d8","amp;dn":"Air+Navigation+Pro+V+5.7.4+IPhone+IOS.ipa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"146286d2ea5e745307c77ad572254dc42d7b81d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,98,134,210,234,94,116,83,7,199,122,213,114,37,77,196,45,123,129,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
