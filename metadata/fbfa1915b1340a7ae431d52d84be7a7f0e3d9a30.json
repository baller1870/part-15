The Iranian-American duo\\'s lively sound revolves around Shahin\\'s graceful, flamenco-tinged guitar textures, unobtrusively embellished by Sepehr\\'s keys and the same low-key, groove-based rhythmic underpinnings that propel the music of 3rd Force. (William Aura and 3rd Force are routinely involved in the production of Shahin &amp; Sepehr\\'s music.) East/West Highway is a best-of compilation that samples the duo\\'s first four recordings (while also tossing in two new tracks), and it presents a decent showcase of the musicians\\' strengths. The pair\\'s sound is handsome, intelligent, and refreshing, with just enough rhythmic and ethnic spice to produce a stylish, feel-good atmosphere. Fortunately, for listeners with a taste for smooth, Spanish-flavored music (with occasional Arabic and samba flourishes; \\&quot;Jakarta\\&quot; and \\&quot;Midnight at the Basilica\\&quot; are winning examples), they all sound pretty good. Pop the CD in your changer with a few other discs, hit shuffle, and you\\'ll likely enjoy the results.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbfa1915b1340a7ae431d52d84be7a7f0e3d9a30","amp;dn":"Shahin+%26+Sepehr+-+Discography+%286+CD%5C%27s+updated+with+artwork%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbfa1915b1340a7ae431d52d84be7a7f0e3d9a30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,250,25,21,177,52,10,122,228,49,213,45,132,190,122,127,14,61,154,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
