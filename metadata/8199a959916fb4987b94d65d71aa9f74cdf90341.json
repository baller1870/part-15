Teca (Bruna Lombardi, who also penned the screenplay) is a popular radio talk show host who uses her skills as an astrologist to help the masses. Having just gotten out of a particularly intense relationship, Teca is attempting to discover her true purpose in life when she makes the acquaintance of her handsome new neighbor Gil (Malvino Salvador). Unfortunately for Teca, Gil is married, leaving the lonely astrologer with precious little company other than her estranged, ailing father Anibal (Juca de Oliveira), who has recently been admitted to a local hospital. Later, when a deranged fan named Luis (Thiago Pinheiro) commits suicide in her apartment, Teca gradually begins to grow aware of the many divergent paths people can take in life. As Teca searches out Luis&amp;#039; grieving girlfriend Julia (Lais Marquis) in hopes of steering the woman away from a similarly gruesome fate, long buried family secrets are gradually unearthed, the transsexual best-friend of her faithful engineer falls victim to some particularly violent bigots, and the self-mutilating Julia eventually discovers why taking the easiest way out isn&amp;#039;t always the wisest option.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : The.Sign.Of.The.City.2007.DVDRip.XviD-VoMiT.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 702 MiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 36mn\n      Bit rate : 1005 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 11.7 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 36mn\n      Bit rate : 873 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 352 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 16/9\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.160\n      StreamSize : 605 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 36mn\n      Bit rate : 123 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 85.5 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.90.\n      Encoding settings : ABR\n\nPortuguese audio, English subtitles\n\nIMDB: tt1119162","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8199a959916fb4987b94d65d71aa9f74cdf90341","amp;dn":"The+Sign+of+the+City+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8199a959916fb4987b94d65d71aa9f74cdf90341","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,153,169,89,145,111,180,152,123,148,214,93,113,170,159,116,205,249,3,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
