In the past, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen the trainers join forces to help singles, couples and families lose weight. This time, they'll take on the remarkable task of saving an entire town.\n\nArarat in western Victoria is one of AustraliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most overweight towns, with 68% of the adult population being overweight or obese.

The Biggest Loser: Challenge Australia is sure to surprise, entertain, inspire and prove that obesity in Australian communities can indeed be overcome. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08904ac51b7620a638deeeb238bbb258ceb2d149","amp;dn":"The.Biggest.Loser.AU.s09e01.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08904ac51b7620a638deeeb238bbb258ceb2d149","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,144,74,197,27,118,32,166,56,222,238,178,56,187,178,88,206,178,209,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
