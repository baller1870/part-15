I am so old that I remember rushing to the record store to get each new PPM album when they were first published on vinyl, and I want to hear each track in its proper context, not randomly selected on a &quot;best of&quot; edition.\n\nIf I remember correctly, these recordings were made with the very latest state-of-the-art analogue master tape recorder at Warner Bros, with surprisingly good stereo quality and dynamics for the pre-digital area. As a comparison, Simon and Garfunkel's original recording of &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; (CBS 1970) has audible tape hiss and lacks dynamics in the more silent parts, especially in the beginning.\n\nTypical for Peter, Paul and Mary was that Peter (tenor) sang in the left channel, Paul (basso) in the right and Mary in the middle. Mary's rich, deep alto often crossed and went under Peter's high falsetto. Both guys were perfectionists on the guitar; you can sometimes hear them competing. In addition they had only a base player on the first records and later added more instruments as their work developed. Their musical arrangement is among the finest ever made of the songs that they chose from artists like Bob Dylan and Donovan.\n\nTip: Click the Number of files (84) up above to see full track list.\n\nMore details with full track list, composers etc. on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter,_Paul_and_Mary#Discography\n\nAdditional info with full texts and guitar chords at\nhttp://www.peterpaulandmary.com/music/f-albums.htm\n\nAlbums included, 12 tracks on each:\n\n1) 1962: Peter, Paul &amp; Mary\n2) 1963: Moving\n3) 1963: In the Wind\n4) 1965: A Song Will Rise\n5) 1965: See What Tomorrow Brings\n6) 1966: Album\n7) 1967: Album 1700\n\nThis chronology is made for their first 7 proper studio records only, each with 12 tracks. Missing here is &quot;In Concert&quot; (1964), a double album with mostly previous songs. I bought this on double vinyl with such a good quality that I never got around to buying the CD edition. Missing are also &quot;In Japan&quot; and &quot;Late Again&quot;, mostly with new recordings of previous songs, and &quot;Peter, Paul and Mommy&quot; mainly with children's songs.\n\n\n\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFile size                        : 1.60 MiB\nDuration                         : 1mn 44s\nOveral bit rate                  : 128 Kbps\nWriting library                  : LAME3.93 \n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nWriting library                  : LAME3.93 \nEncoding settings                : CBR\n\nComplete track list:\n/01-Peter, Paul and Mary 1962/01-01-Early In The Morning.mp3 1.47 MiB \n/01-Peter, Paul and Mary 1962/01-02-500 Miles.mp3 2.57 MiB \n/01-Peter, Paul and Mary 1962/01-03-Sorrow.mp3 2.65 MiB \n/01-Peter, Paul and Mary 1962/01-04-This Train.mp3 2 MiB \n/01-Peter, Paul and Mary 1962/01-05-Bamboo.mp3 2.33 MiB \n/01-Peter, Paul and Mary 1962/01-06-It's Raining.mp3 4.01 MiB \n/01-Peter, Paul and Mary 1962/01-07-If I Had My Way.mp3 2.22 MiB \n/01-Peter, Paul and Mary 1962/01-08-Cruel War.mp3 3.17 MiB \n/01-Peter, Paul and Mary 1962/01-09-Lemon Tree.mp3 2.68 MiB \n/01-Peter, Paul and Mary 1962/01-10-If I Had a Hammer.mp3 1.98 MiB \n/01-Peter, Paul and Mary 1962/01-11-Autumn To May.mp3 2.54 MiB \n/01-Peter, Paul and Mary 1962/01-12-Where Have All the Flowers Gone.mp3 3.59 MiB \n/02-Moving 1963/02-01-Settle Down.mp3 1.6 MiB \n/02-Moving 1963/02-02-Gone the Rainbow.mp3 2.46 MiB \n/02-Moving 1963/02-03-Flora.mp3 2.9 MiB \n/02-Moving 1963/02-04-Pretty Mary.mp3 1.79 MiB \n/02-Moving 1963/02-05-Puff, the Magic Dragon.mp3 3.16 MiB \n/02-Moving 1963/02-06-This Land Is Your Land.mp3 2.24 MiB \n/02-Moving 1963/02-07-Man Come into Egypt.mp3 2.12 MiB \n/02-Moving 1963/02-08-Old Coat.mp3 3.49 MiB \n/02-Moving 1963/02-09-Tiny Sparrow.mp3 3.26 MiB \n/02-Moving 1963/02-10-Big Boat.mp3 2.49 MiB \n/02-Moving 1963/02-11-Morning Train.mp3 3.32 MiB \n/02-Moving 1963/02-12-A'soalin.mp3 2.99 MiB \n/03-In the Wind 1963/03-01-Very Last Day.mp3 2.34 MiB \n/03-In the Wind 1963/03-02-Hus-A-Bye.mp3 2.19 MiB \n/03-In the Wind 1963/03-03-Long Chain On.mp3 4.25 MiB \n/03-In the Wind 1963/03-04-Rocky Road.mp3 3.39 MiB \n/03-In the Wind 1963/03-05-Tell It on the Mountain.mp3 2.72 MiB \n/03-In the Wind 1963/03-06-Polly Von.mp3 3.82 MiB \n/03-In the Wind 1963/03-07-Stewball.mp3 2.94 MiB \n/03-In the Wind 1963/03-08-All My Trials.mp3 3.05 MiB \n/03-In the Wind 1963/03-09-Don't Think Twice, It's All Right.mp3 3 MiB \n/03-In the Wind 1963/03-10-Freight Train.mp3 2.56 MiB \n/03-In the Wind 1963/03-11-Quit Your Low Down Ways.mp3 1.94 MiB \n/03-In the Wind 1963/03-12-Blowin' in the Wind.mp3 2.71 MiB \n/04-A Song Will Rise/04-01-When The Ship Comes In.mp3 2.43 MiB \n/04-A Song Will Rise/04-02-Jimmy Whalen.mp3 2.46 MiB \n/04-A Song Will Rise/04-03-Come and Go With Me.mp3 2.87 MiB \n/04-A Song Will Rise/04-04-Gilgarra Mountain.mp3 5.53 MiB \n/04-A Song Will Rise/04-05-Ballad of Spring Hill.mp3 2.95 MiB \n/04-A Song Will Rise/04-06-Motherless Child.mp3 3.41 MiB \n/04-A Song Will Rise/04-07-Wasn't That A Time.mp3 2.21 MiB \n/04-A Song Will Rise/04-08-Monday Morning.mp3 3.03 MiB \n/04-A Song Will Rise/04-09-The Cuckoo.mp3 2.16 MiB \n/04-A Song Will Rise/04-10-The San Francisco Bay Blues.mp3 2.78 MiB \n/04-A Song Will Rise/04-11-Talkin' Candy Bar Blues.mp3 2.39 MiB \n/04-A Song Will Rise/04-12-For Lovin' Me.mp3 1.96 MiB \n/05-See What Tomorrow Brings/05-01-If I Were Free.mp3 2.56 MiB \n/05-See What Tomorrow Brings/05-02-Betty &amp;
