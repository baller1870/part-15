He is widely regarded as the national poet of Scotland and is celebrated worldwide. He is the best known of the poets who have written in the Scots language, although much of his writing is also in English and a light Scots dialect, accessible to an audience beyond Scotland. He also wrote in standard English, and in these writings his political or civil commentary is often at its bluntest.\n\nBurns's style is marked by spontaneity, directness, and sincerity, and ranges from the tender intensity of some of his lyrics through the humour of &quot;Tam o' Shanter&quot; and the satire of &quot;Holy Willie's Prayer&quot; and &quot;The Holy Fair&quot;. Statue of Burns in Dumfries town centre, unveiled in 1882 Burns's poetry drew upon a substantial familiarity with and knowledge of Classical, Biblical, and English literature, as well as the Scottish Makar tradition. Burns was skilled in writing not only in the Scots language but also in the Scottish English dialect of the English language. Some of his works, such as &quot;Love and Liberty&quot; (also known as &quot;The Jolly Beggars&quot;), are written in both Scots and English for various effects.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n* A Night Out with Robert Burns - The Greatest Poems (Canongate Books)\n\n* Poems of Robert Burns (Penguin Books)\n\n* The Canongate Burns - The Complete Poems and Songs of Robert Burns (Canongate Books)\n\n* The Complete Works of Robert Burns (Delphi Classics)\n \n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Burns&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Burns&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.robertburns.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.robertburns.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71551f0d8c1d065c02f11d3a2f5cb003b236ee7d","amp;dn":"Robert+Burns+-+Poetry+%26amp%3B+Songs+%284+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71551f0d8c1d065c02f11d3a2f5cb003b236ee7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,85,31,13,140,29,6,92,2,241,29,58,47,92,176,3,178,54,238,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
