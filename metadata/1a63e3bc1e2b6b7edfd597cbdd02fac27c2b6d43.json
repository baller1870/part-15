These are ripped from records I inherited from my father&amp;#039;s LP collection and the average age is 40-50 years old so the sound quality varies quite a bit due to the fact these were played on a 1959 vintage Garrard &amp;#039;table.  I&amp;#039;ve done my best to clean them up with my VPI machine and the results are quite remarkable if not in the &quot;miracle worker&quot; category.  Worth it alone for the albums &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot; and &quot;Drown In My Own Tears&quot;, the latter for the undeniably soulful rendition of &quot;Stand By Me&quot;.  Fans of inspired interpretation of standards and especially the Gershwin reptoire will enjoy these.\n\nPeace,\n\nJunco","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a63e3bc1e2b6b7edfd597cbdd02fac27c2b6d43","amp;dn":"Don+Shirley++5+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a63e3bc1e2b6b7edfd597cbdd02fac27c2b6d43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,99,227,188,30,43,107,126,223,213,151,203,221,2,250,194,124,43,109,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
