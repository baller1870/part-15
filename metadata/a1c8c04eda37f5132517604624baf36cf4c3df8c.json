Such is the case with the Trammps. Best known for their smash hit from the Saturday Night Fever Soundtrack, &quot;Disco Inferno&quot; (their only Top 20 appearance on the pop charts), the group had many other hits on the R&amp;B charts, which were just as deserving of crossover success. Just about any track from the excellent This Is Where All the Happy People Go: The Best of the Trammps compilation is a solid example of &amp;#039;70s R&amp;B at its finest and most expertly crafted. Many overlooked and forgotten gems reside here, such as &quot;Hold Back the Night,&quot; &quot;Trammps Disco Theme,&quot; &quot;That&amp;#039;s Where the Happy People Go,&quot; and &quot;Zing Went the Strings of My Heart.&quot; Admittedly, the Trammps did seem to jump on the disco bandwagon, like so many other bands from this era, but the quality of the music never suffered. For a representation of some of the &amp;#039;70s most underrated dance music, The Best of the Trammps simply can&amp;#039;t be beat. (AMG)\n\n\n01. Zing!
