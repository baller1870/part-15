This 1 hour, 20 minute DVD contains the unedited, uncut, entire concert they gave in Nyon, Switzerland, where they closed the Paleo Festival. Through the late 80's and 90's, Sly &amp; Robbie revolutionized Jamaican music by turning Reggae into Dancehall. They chose to reunite with Black Uhuru, whom they had helped become a leading force in the Reggae industry in the late 70's, early 80's. Black Uhuru's harder, more urgent sound proved to be an ideal vehicle for Sly &amp; Robbie's creativity and greatly benefited from the Riddim Twins' desire to push the boundaries of Jamaican music in new and unheard of directions. \n\n\nEnjoy and Seed .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03ba0a242ac2f923c078f4f50dc577bb4d7c2a99","amp;dn":"Black+Uhuru+-+With+Sly+And+Robbie+Dubbin%5C%27+It+Live+DVD+%28+iso+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03ba0a242ac2f923c078f4f50dc577bb4d7c2a99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,186,10,36,42,194,249,35,192,120,244,245,13,197,119,187,77,124,42,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
