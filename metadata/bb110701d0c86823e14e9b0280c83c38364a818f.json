Produced by Cameron McVey (Massive Attack/NenehCherry) and Donaghy herself, the album aims for a more contemporary adult pop/rock sound than that of the Sugababes. The singles \\&amp;#039;Overrated\\&amp;#039; and \\&amp;#039;Twist Of Fate\\&amp;#039; are also featured.\n\nThe original CD was copy-protected and I couldn\\&amp;#039;t play it. I finally managed to MP3 it, so I\\&amp;#039;m uploading to others who bought in good faith and got shafted.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb110701d0c86823e14e9b0280c83c38364a818f","amp;dn":"Siobhan+Donaghy+2003+%28Revolution+in+Me%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb110701d0c86823e14e9b0280c83c38364a818f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,17,7,1,208,200,104,35,225,78,155,2,128,200,60,56,54,74,129,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
