These elite starship captains were trained to\naccomplish the impossible at whatever cost necessary. Whether\nemploying stealth or brute force, they were always deadly. Using\nthese Operatives, the Drox built a starlane system for quick\ntravel amongst the stars, colonized and conquered millions of\nplanets, and ruled the galaxy with an iron grip for over 100,000\nyears. Eventually realizing their Operatives were a threat, they\nattempted to assassinate all of them. They failed. The following\nGalactic Civil War was devastating\n\nThousands of years later, the Drox are extinct, but the secretive\nDrox Operative guild lives on. They have learned their lesson\nthough: loyalty to any one race is foolish. They now work for\nwhoever can pay. And pay they do! Empires might span hundreds of\nplanets and thousands of ships, but when a critical task arises\nthey still turn to an Operative\n\nIn the new space race, the major races are scouting, colonizing\nand expanding, trying to take over the galaxy by diplomacy\ntechnology, war, or any other means their scheming minds can\ncontemplate\n\nAs a Drox Operative it's NOT your job to manage all of those\nannoying people, build thousands of buildings, play nice with\nyour enemies, or balance the budget. It IS your job to pick the\nwinning side and maybe even help them conquer the galaxy if\nyou're being nice, more importantly though is to rake in as many\ncredits as possible, well that and build the coolest, deadliest\nship in the known universe. Not many screw with an Operative\ncaptaining a Dreadnaught!\n\nFeatures:\n\nExplore a dynamic and evolving galaxy\nExplore a unique sector of the galaxy in every game, with\ndifferent &quot;monsters&quot;, ship components, quests, and even races\nFight in the galactic war between the various alien races\nBattle hundreds of different enemy starships\nBuild the coolest and deadliest starship in the galaxy\nOutfit your ship with thousands of components and crew\nAdventure with your friends with co-op multiplayer\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nWindows Minimum specs:\nWindows 98/ME/2000/XP/Vista/Win7\n1.5 GHz Pentium 4 (or other equivalent)\n256MB RAM\nGeForce 2 (or other equivalent)\n200MB of hard drive space\nDSL or better for multiplayer on internet\n\nWindows Recommended specs:\n2.0 GHz Pentium 4 (or other equivalent)\n256MB RAM\nGeForce 3 or better (or other equivalent)\n\nWhats New in v1.020?:\n\nOpen changes.txt for a full list of whats new\n\nFor More Info on Drox Operative Visit: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.soldak.com/Drox-Operative/Overview.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.soldak.com/Drox-Operative/Overview.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSCENE NOTICE:\n\nUpon Winrar 5 beta becoming final, TE is going to be using the\nnew RAR5 as the new standard for RAR required archival.
