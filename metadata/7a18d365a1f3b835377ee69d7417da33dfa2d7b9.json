The bassist&amp;#039;s position was taken by Tom Prince. TREDEGAR made a name for themselves by self financing their self-titled album and &quot;Duma&quot;, single release. Finding themselves minus a vocalist prior to recording the first album in 1986, PERSIAN RISK and TOKYO BLADE frontman Carl Sentence performed vocal duties on the record. The first 500 copies of the album sleeve were coated in genuine gold leaf, making them much sought after collectors items. Sentence&amp;#039;s career took him on through the GEEZER BUTLER BAND, PAUL CHAPMAN&amp;#039;s GHOST and KROKUS.\nTREDEGAR finally found a permanent vocalist in Russ North just before the album&amp;#039;s release and the band would prove club regulars including many old BUDGIE numbers in their set. Guitarist Andy Wood bailed out in the Summer of 1987 but did cut a new demo utilising TREDEGAR frontman Russ North as session vocalist. Prince quit to join ex-ANGEL WITCH drummer Dave Dufort&amp;#039;s act PHANTASM and was replaced by Mike Taylor. \nNorth and Wood also quit as they joined Midlands act CLOVEN HOOF for the &amp;#039;Dominator&amp;#039; album. Taylor also departed leaving TREDEGAR as a duo of Bourge and Phillips before the addition of guitarist Lee Jones in late 1987.\nThe band recorded a second album in 1991 with vocalist Trixie Thorne but this never saw the light of day until the &amp;#039;Remix And Rebirth&amp;#039; CD in 1995. &amp;#039;Remix And Rebirth&amp;#039;, contained Tredegar&amp;#039;s 1986 full-length debut in its entirety, their unreleased 1991 album in its entirety, and some extra tracks. All tracks were re-mastered.\nJones jumped ship joining HAMMERFIST for a brief period before TREDEGAR were resurrected by Phillips in 1993 retitled SIX TON BUDGIE, the pre-recording name of BUDGIE.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a18d365a1f3b835377ee69d7417da33dfa2d7b9","amp;dn":"TREDEGAR+-+Remix+%26+Rebirth+%2886-91%29+-+80s+Geophagus+series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a18d365a1f3b835377ee69d7417da33dfa2d7b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,24,211,101,161,243,184,53,55,126,230,157,116,23,218,51,223,162,215,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
