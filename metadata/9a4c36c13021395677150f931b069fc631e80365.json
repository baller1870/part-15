Forget about the old muddy sounding older releases... Here you get the greatest Genesis records in the best sounding version. Normally I'm not a fan of new mixed classic's because mostly they're sounding heavily compressed and equalized. But these records sound like I wished to hear them all the time. It turn some of the greatest ProgRock records into a great experience!!!\n\n\nTechnical Informations:\n\nMusic Hall MMF 5.1 Turntable\nGoldring 1042 reference Cartridge\nBelari VP-129 Tube Phono PreAmp with Sylvania 12AX7WA\nTascam US-144 external USB 2.0 Audiointerface\nInterconnections by &quot;Goldkabel&quot;\nAudacity 1.3.5 Recording Software\nClickRepair 3.0.1 with extremly light settings (DeClick 10/DeCrackle 0) has been used to remove some clicks present due to static charge of the vinyl.\n\n\n\n\nTHIS IS THE SECOND, STAY TUNE FOR THE OTHER\n\nNursery Crime (1971) Info\n\n\nAll songs by Tony Banks, Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel, Steve Hackett and Mike Rutherford.\n\nSide one\n1. &quot;The Musical Box&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 10:24\n2. &quot;For Absent Friends&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:44\n3. &quot;The Return of the Giant Hogweed&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:09\n\nSide two\n1. &quot;Seven Stones&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:08\n2. &quot;Harold the Barrel&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:59\n3. &quot;Harlequin&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:53\n4. &quot;The Fountain of Salmacis&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:54\n\nPersonnel\n* Peter Gabriel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ lead voices, flute, bass drum, tambourine\n* Steve Hackett ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ electric guitar, 12 string guitar\n* Tony Banks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ organ, mellotron, piano, electric piano, 12 string guitar, voices\n* Mike Rutherford ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass, bass pedals, 12 string guitar, voices\n* Phil Collins ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums, voices, percussion, lead voices (uncredited) on &quot;For Absent Friends&quot;\n\n\nWhile burning you should add a gap of approx 3 seconds between each track!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a4c36c13021395677150f931b069fc631e80365","amp;dn":"Genesis-Nursery+Crime%281971%29%282008+Vinyl+Box%29%5BVinyl+Rip-FLAC%5D%5BTWR1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a4c36c13021395677150f931b069fc631e80365","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,76,54,193,48,33,57,86,119,21,15,147,27,6,159,198,49,232,3,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
