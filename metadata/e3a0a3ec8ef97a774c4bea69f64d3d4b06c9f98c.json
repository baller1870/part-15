He  wrote  his  first songs as a boy in\nNewton, Mississippi. In 1973, he  graduated  from  high  school  and\nheaded for Nashville, where  he played in country bands at night and\nworked  blue-collar  jobs  during  the  day.  Despite  his  efforts,\nOverstreet couldn&amp;#039;t break into the industry.\n\nEventually, his songs were being recorded by other, more established\nartists. In 1982, his &quot;Same Ole Me&quot; was  recorded  by  George Jones,\nwho took the song to number five. That same year, Overstreet had his\nfirst  charting  single, when &quot;Beautiful Baby&quot; climbed to number 76.\nThree years later, the  Forrester Sisters  took  his &quot;I Fell in Love\nAgain Last Night&quot; - which he co-wrote with Thom Schuyler - to number\none. Later  in  1985, Randy Travis  had  hits  with  two  Overstreet\ncompositions - &quot;On the Other Hand&quot; (which  was  co-written  with Don\nSchlitz) and &quot;Diggin&amp;#039; Up Bones,&quot; the  singer&amp;#039;s first number one hit.\nTanya Tucker, Marie Osmond and  Paul Davis  also  had  success  with\nOverstreet songs that year.\n\nOverstreet  became  a  full-fledged recording artist in 1986 when he\nteamed up with Schuyler and Fred Knobloch to form SKO, which  scored\na number one  hit  with &quot;Baby&amp;#039;s Got a New Baby.&quot; In 1987, Overstreet\nscored one of his biggest songwriting hits when  he  provided  Randy\nTravis  with  &quot;Forever and Ever, Amen.&quot; As  his  string  of hits for\nother artists continued, Overstreet  released  his 1989 debut album,\nSowin&amp;#039; Love, which made it to the Top 40 and produced  a  few  hits.\nHis second album, Heroes, came out in 1991 and stayed on the  charts\nfor nearly a year. When  his third album, 1992&amp;#039;s Love is Strong, was\na commercial disappointment, Overstreet shifted his focus to writing\nmore  religious  material and began recording with Susie Luchsinger,\nthe sister of Reba McEntire. Time was  released  in  February  1996.\nLiving By the Book followed five years later.\n\n..: Album Review :..\n\nThe  ultimate  New  Traditionalist  factory songwriter, Overstreet&amp;#039;s\nbest work is the series of hits he wrote (usually  with  Don Shlitz)\nfor Randy Travis in the 1980s. On  his  own, as  evidenced  by  this\ncollection, he&amp;#039;s  a  bit too obsessed with convincing everybody that\nhe&amp;#039;s a good Christian man who just can&amp;#039;t wait to  get  home  to  his\nwife. There&amp;#039;s  more  to  life - and  music - than family values, no\nmatter how you define them.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3a0a3ec8ef97a774c4bea69f64d3d4b06c9f98c","amp;dn":"Paul+Overstreet-The+Best+Of+%281994-VBR-Country%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3a0a3ec8ef97a774c4bea69f64d3d4b06c9f98c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,160,163,236,142,249,122,119,76,75,234,105,246,77,61,75,6,201,249,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
