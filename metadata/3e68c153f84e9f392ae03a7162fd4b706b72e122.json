Now he reveals the jaw-dropping lengths Barack Obama and his allies in Hollywood, Washington, and Academia went to in order to transform a legion of iPod-listening, MTV-watching followers into a winning coalition that threatens to become a long-lasting political realignment.\n\nObama Zombies uncovers the true, behind-the-scenes story of the methods and tactics the Obama campaign unleashed on youth culture. Through personal interviews and meticulous original research, Mattera explains why conservatismÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s future rests upon jolting the young masses from their slumber, yanking out their earphones, and sparking a countercultural conservative battle against the rise of the ignorant Left.\n\nThe lesson from 2008 is crystal clear: When true conservatives run away, Obama zombies come out to play.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/hAnafAAei&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/hAnafAAei&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Obama-Zombies-Liberal-Brainwashed-Generation/dp/B005CDVGIA/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372459827&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Obama+Zombies%3A+How+the+Liberal+Machine+Brainwashed+My+Generation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Obama-Zombies-Liberal-Brainwashed-Generation/dp/B005CDVGIA/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372459827&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Obama+Zombies%3A+How+the+Liberal+Machine+Brainwashed+My+Generation&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e68c153f84e9f392ae03a7162fd4b706b72e122","amp;dn":"Obama+Zombies%3A+How+the+Liberal+Machine+Brainwashed+My+Generation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e68c153f84e9f392ae03a7162fd4b706b72e122","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,104,193,83,248,78,159,57,42,224,58,113,98,253,75,112,107,114,225,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
