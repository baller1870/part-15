Select what resolution you want.\n\n5.Click play. If the game asks you for CD even after you mounted the ISO just click continue or cancel if continue does not work. It will still load the game anyway.\n\nIf you have some problems please open the folder:\n\\&quot;Open this in case of problems\\&quot;\n\nIf you have a very bad performance then do this:\n\nRename d3d8.dll to d3d8.dll.bak and dinput8.dll to dinput8.dll.bak to disable mge, this will disable some nice effects from MGE but it will lag a lot less.\n\nOR as an alternative go to MGEXEgui.exe and go to the distand lands tab, and lower the distance to 25-50-100. Or whatever distance you want.\n\nYou also need netframework 4.0, the latest direct x runtime and all the other runtimes that games usually require so please get those or else\nyou will encounter errors.\n\nHave fun! If you wish to thank the developers for their games then buy them.\n--------- ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f44b256e146ad0781663cd3675c93eb591426b86","amp;dn":"Morrowind+Modded+2012+Unrar%26amp%3BPlay","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f44b256e146ad0781663cd3675c93eb591426b86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,75,37,110,20,106,208,120,22,99,205,54,117,201,62,181,145,66,107,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
