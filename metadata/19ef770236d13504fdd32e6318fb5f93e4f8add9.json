The album contains twelve original tracks, four vocal and eight instrumental.\n The overall vibe is a luxurious mix of chilled out downtempo ranging from light vocal to deeper dubs, glitch and experimental electronica musings.\n Electric pianos abound and the use of flugal horn and muted trumpet adds an element of cool jazz into the mix, creating a truly eclectic listening experience. A lounge lizards idea of heaven on earth, DEEPER THAN THE SEA is a perfect fit for anyone looking to chill out, relax and kick back.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19ef770236d13504fdd32e6318fb5f93e4f8add9","amp;dn":"Evolve+-+Deeper+Than+the+Sea+%282013%29+Album+%40+MP3+Downtempo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19ef770236d13504fdd32e6318fb5f93e4f8add9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,239,119,2,54,209,53,4,253,211,46,99,24,251,95,147,228,248,173,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
