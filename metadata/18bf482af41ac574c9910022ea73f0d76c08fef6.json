The contributors have been selected on the basis of both their outstanding scientific level and their clarity of exposition. Thus, the present collection is particularly suited to young researchers and graduate students. Through this volume, the editors intend to provide the reader with material otherwise difficult to find and written in a manner which is also accessible to nonexperts.\nContents: Complex Variables and Potential Theory: Integral Representations in Complex, Hypercomplex and Clifford Analysis (H Begehr); Nonlinear Potential Theory in Metric Spaces (O Martio); Differential Equations and Nonlinear Analysis: An Introduction to Mean Curvature Flow (G Bellettini); Introduction to Bifurcation Theory (P DrA?bek); A Nonlinear Eigenvalue Problems (P Lindqvist); Nonlinear Elliptic Equations with Critical and Supercritical Sobolev Exponents (D Passaseo); Eigenvalue Analysis of Elliptic Operators (G Rozenblum); A Glimpse of the Theory of Nonlinear Semigroups (E Vesentini); Harmonic Analysis: Integral Geometry and Spectral Analysis (M Agranovsky); Fourier Analysis and Geometric Combinatorics (A Iosevich); Lectures on Eigenfunctions of the Laplacian (C D Sogge); Five Lectures on Harmonic Analysis (F Soria); Fractal Analysis, an Approach via Function Spaces (H Triebel).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18bf482af41ac574c9910022ea73f0d76c08fef6","amp;dn":"Topics+in+Mathematical+Analysis+2008+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18bf482af41ac574c9910022ea73f0d76c08fef6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,191,72,42,244,26,197,116,201,145,0,34,234,115,240,215,108,8,254,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
