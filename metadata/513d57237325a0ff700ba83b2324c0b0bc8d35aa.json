Strait died in a December 1998 car accident, with Snot on the verge of breaking big, thanks to critical kudos and a stint on Ozzfest '98. Strait Up features a dozen of heavy rock's most prominent singers, including Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst, Korn's Jonathan Davis, Incubus's Brandon Boyd, and Sugar Ray's Mark McGrath paying homage to the late frontman. In 1998, Snot's Mikey Doling and John &quot;Tumor&quot; Fahenstock had music awaiting lyrics from Strait, who passed away before beginning the album. So the singers on Strait Up wrote their own lyrics to Snot's heavy music and recorded with the surviving members of Snot. The results are impressive. System of a Down's Serj Tankian offers up a eulogy in &quot;Starlit Eyes&quot;: &quot;The first to accept, the last to disappoint / Now you are free to roam the skies.&quot; Slipknot's Corey Taylor turns in a melodic but aggro &quot;Requiem,&quot; singing: &quot;I see the loss every time someone says your name.&quot; But it's the mellow emotion exuded by Sevendust's Lajon Witherspoon in &quot;Angel's Son&quot; that is the standout on a powerful album full of poignant triumphs. --Katherine Turman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:513d57237325a0ff700ba83b2324c0b0bc8d35aa","amp;dn":"Strait+Up+-+A+Tribute+To+Lynn+Strait%28adonis%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"513d57237325a0ff700ba83b2324c0b0bc8d35aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,61,87,35,115,37,160,255,112,11,168,59,35,36,192,176,188,141,53,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
