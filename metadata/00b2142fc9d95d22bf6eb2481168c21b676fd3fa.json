A sense of Ã¢â‚¬Å“being differentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ grows to alienation, until he angrily blames this once-enchanting land for his feelings of isolation. All of this is told through the fantastical eyes of young Danny, a boy growing up in the Ã¢â‚¬â„¢90s fed on dramatic adventure stories like Jurassic Park and X-Men. DannyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s older brother, Luke, travels to a remote island to teach English to the employees of ClockWorld, an ambitious new amusement park that recreates historical events. When Luke doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t return after two years, Danny travels to ClockWorld to convince Luke to return to America. But Luke has made a new life, new family, and even a new personality for himself on ClockWorld, rendering him almost unrecognizable to his own brother. Danny comes of age as he explores the island, ClockWorld, and fights to bring his brother home. New School is unlike anything in the history of the comics medium: at once funny and deadly serious, easily readable while wildly artistic, personal and political, familiar and completely new.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00b2142fc9d95d22bf6eb2481168c21b676fd3fa","amp;dn":"Dash+Shaw+-+New+School","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00b2142fc9d95d22bf6eb2481168c21b676fd3fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,178,20,47,201,217,93,34,191,110,178,72,17,104,194,27,103,111,211,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
