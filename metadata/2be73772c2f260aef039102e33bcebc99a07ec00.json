This version is bundled with Lexar flash cards (in my case Lexar Professional 300x UDMA CF 8GB). Some features:\n\n- full English version 10.10 (the newest &quot;original&quot; version is 10.03 - available thru patches). It cannot be installed as an upgrade of the regular version, so please  uninstall theold PSPX.\n- full retail version, does not need any serial number, does not call home. etc. but:\n- there is an popup window &quot;buy PSP XII&quot;) when you close the application. It is not partilarly annoying but I will appreciate if you know the way I can rid of it.  \n- in some places of the program written Corel in cooperation with Lexar\n\nEnjoy!\n\nPS In the afternoon I will upload Lexar Image Rescue 3  which was also bundled with the card.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2be73772c2f260aef039102e33bcebc99a07ec00","amp;dn":"Corel+Paint+Shop+Pro+X+Photo+retail+%28Lexar+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2be73772c2f260aef039102e33bcebc99a07ec00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,231,55,114,194,242,96,174,240,57,16,46,51,188,235,201,154,7,236,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
