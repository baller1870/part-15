High Priest \n\nSYNOPSIS:- Herod the Great (1960)\nThe long-forgotten Italian historical epic Herod the Great (AKA Erode il Grande, 1960), dramatizes the dark final years of the title figure, an evil Judean Tetrarch notorious for sending Christ to the cross in league with Pontius Pilate. The story begins with Herod (Edmond Purdom) and Antony's shared defeat by Rome (when the two men foolishly decide to form an allegiance and go head to head with the colossal Empire), and ends with Herod's slide into insanity following Christ's death. Throughout, the ruler exhibits utter lunacy, raving constantly and spewing forth torrents of unbridled anger; the picture's overtone thus remains bleak, despairing and relentlessly gloomy throughout (take it or leave it). Arnaldo Genoino directs; Damiano Damiani, Federico Zardo, Tourjansky and Fernando Cerchio co-scripted.\n\n===============================================================\n\nBible Epics - Esther and the King (1960) \n\nEsther and the King is a 1960 Italian / U.S.A. CinemaScope international co-production religious epic film directed (with Mario Bava, the film's director of photography, who was credited as a co-director on Italian prints of the film [1]), written, and produced by Raoul Walsh. It was produced at 20th Century Fox/ Raoul Walsh Productions, and was released by 20th Century Fox. Joan Collins stars as Esther in this melodramatic, routine Biblical story. Based on the Old Testament, this epic recreates the Book of Esther, the tale that is the basis for the Jewish celebration of Purim.\n\n    CAST:-\n    Joan Collins - Esther\n    Richard Egan - King Ahasuerus\n    Denis O'Dea - Mordecai\n    Sergio Fantoni - Haman\n    Renato Baldini - Kildrates\n    Gabriele Tinti - Samuel\n    Rosalba Neri Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Keresh\n    Daniela Rocca - Queen Vashti\n    Folco Lulli - Tobiah\n    Rik Battaglia Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Simon\n\nDirected by Raoul Walsh\nProduced by Raoul Walsh\nScreenplay by Raoul Walsh, Michael Elkins\nMusic by Angelo Francesco Lavagnino\n\nSYNOPSIS:- Esther and the King (1960)\nThe film is set in Persia in the 5th century BC.
