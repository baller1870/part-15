It found its way into the libraries of the CIA, the FBI, the White House, and homes all across America and overseas in Spanish and excerpted in other languages. In this hard-hitting book an urgent need is finally fulfilled. In one exciting, readable volume, the incredible story of Communism is graphically told. We believe this to be the most vivid and comprehensive book on the subject ever published. It contains a distillation of more than a hundred books and treatises on Communism, many written by Marxist authors. We see the Communist the way he sees himself---stripped of propaganda and pretense. Hence the title, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Naked Communist.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Here is explained CommunismÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s amazing appeal, its history, and its basic and unchanging concepts---even its secret time-table of conquest! Vital questions are clearly answered---Who gave Russia the A-bomb? How did the FBI fight the battle of the underground? Why did the West lose 600 million allies after World War II? What really happened in Korea? What is CommunismÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great secret weapon? Is there an answer to Communism? What lies ahead?\n\nReview\n\n\n&quot;I went back and I read 'The Naked Communist' and at the end of that Skousen predicted someday soon you won't be able to find the truth in schools or in libraries or anywhere else because it won't be in print anymore. So you must collect those books. It's an idea I read from Cleon Skousen from his book in the 1950s, 'The Naked Communist,' and where he talked about someday the history of this country's going to be lost because it's going to be hijacked by intellectuals and communists and everything else. And I think we're there.&quot;\n--Glenn Beck, Host of the &quot;Glenn Beck Show&quot;\n\n&quot;I feel certain that your efforts on this important subject (communism) will receive widespread attention and consideration.&quot;\n--J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nI admonish everybody to read that [The Naked Communist] excellent book of Chief Skousen's\n--David O. McKay, President of &quot;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints,&quot; LDS General Conference October 1959\n\nWe believe in a moral code. Communism denies innate right or wrong. As W. Cleon Skousen has said in his timely book, The Naked Communist: The communist 'has convinced himself that nothing is evil which answers the call of expediency.' This is a most damnable doctrine. People who truly accept such a philosophy have neither conscience nor honor. Force, trickery, lies, broken promises are wholly justified.&quot;\n\n-- Ezra Taft Benson, United States Secretary of Agriculture under President Dwight D. Eisenhower\nAbout the Author\nW. Cleon Skousen is best remembered as a popular author, speaker and teacher who lectured in every state and province in North America, and in more than 60 countries world-wide. He was a student of history and a scholar of law, specializing in the principles of Freedom, the U.S. Constitution, economics, and ancient history and scriptures.\n\nHe was invited to write a new constitution for Canada and the proposed United States of Latin America, and he published a model constitution that could be adopted by nations everywhere. He served in the FBI for 16 years, four years as Chief of Police in Salt Lake City, and ten years as a university professor. He was a prolific writer and produced three national best sellers, The Naked Communist, The Naked Capitalist, and The Five Thousand Year Leap. Eight of his books were used as college texts, and several were translated and published in other countries.\n\nDr. Skousen was born in Canada, and returned to the U.S. with his family at age ten. He spent two years in Mexico, two years in England, graduated from San Bernardino College in California, and received his juris doctor degree from George Washington University Law School. He was admitted to practice law in the District of Columbia and before the District Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nHis seminars on the Constitution have been taught to several million across the U.S., and among his students were dozens of U.S. Senators and Representatives, two Supreme Court justices, and several candidates for President. He believed knowledge and understanding were key to maintaining a free country, and spent his entire adult life opening up complex issues for deeper understanding by students and audiences all around the world.\n\nMr. Skousen and his wife, Jewel Pitcher of San Bernardino, California, are the parents of eight children, 50 grandchildren, and more than 120 great-grandchildren.\n\nFor more information please contact &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0c65626a634c7b6f606963627f6763797f6962226f636122&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \n\n\n\nSeries: The Naked Series\nPaperback: 412 pages\nPublisher: CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform; 5th Edition edition (March 5, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 148267789X\nISBN-13: 978-1482677898\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: NEP,Lenin,Brezhnev,ÃÅ¡ÃÅ¸ÃÂ¡ÃÂ¡, KPSS, CSU, Soviet, Union, USSR, KGB, SVR, FSB, ÃÅ¡ÃÂ¾ÃÂ¼ÃÂ¸Ã‘â€šÃÂµÃ‘â€š, ÃÂ³ÃÂ¾Ã‘ï¿½Ã‘Æ’ÃÂ´ÃÂ°Ã‘â‚¬Ã‘ï¿½Ã‘â€šÃÂ²ÃÂµÃÂ½ÃÂ½ÃÂ¾ÃÂ¹, ÃÂ±ÃÂµÃÂ·ÃÂ¾ÃÂ¿ÃÂ°Ã‘ï¿½ÃÂ½ÃÂ¾Ã‘ï¿½Ã‘â€šÃÂ¸, Ãâ€ºÃÂµÃ‘â€žÃÂ¾Ã‘â‚¬Ã‘â€šÃÂ¾ÃÂ²Ã‘ï¿½ÃÂºÃÂ°Ã‘ï¿½, Ã‘â€šÃ‘Å½Ã‘â‚¬Ã‘Å’ÃÂ¼ÃÂ°, Ãï¿½ÃÂºÃ‘â€šÃÂ¸ÃÂ²ÃÂ½Ã‘â€¹ÃÂµ ,ÃÂ¼ÃÂµÃ‘â‚¬ÃÂ¾ÃÂ¿Ã‘â‚¬ÃÂ¸Ã‘ï¿½Ã‘â€šÃÂ¸Ã‘ï¿½, NKGB, MVD, Internal, Troops, OGPU, MGB, NKVD, cheka, chekist, russia, russian, director, directorate, cold, war, communist, socialist, espionage, intelligence, national, security, political, science, residentzia, maskinrovka, international, relations, coup, propaganda, information, destabilization, surveillance, central, intelligence, human, resource, asset, spy, cycle, humint, techint, masint, sigint, red, army, stalin, lenin, mao, prc, mss, revolution, lefortovo, moscow, kremlin, st. petersburg, putin, german, Premier Nikita Khrushchev,democratic, republic, gdr, dprk, democratic, peoples, republic, korea, soviet, state, republic, security studies, intelligence studies, national, security, Vladimir,Kryuchkov, Aleksandr, Shelepin, Julian Wadleigh, Alger Hiss, wikileaks, julian, assuange, bryan, chealsea, manning, cpusa, tehran, ricin, georgi, markov, alexander, litvinenko, anatoliy, golitsyn, bulgaria, Vladipir, Putin, torture, regime, persecution, gulag, work, camp, siberia, commissar, coup, afghanistan, vietnam, hungary, naked, socialist front, internationalist, EU, Asia, Thailand, Ukraine, South Korea, ROK, North Korea, DPRK, China, Taiwan, ROC, Japan, ASEAN, NATO, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Zapa, la raza, democracy, democratic, republican, house, senate, ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a98f99631567976f14c6e2fe9422104b2189ac22","amp;dn":"The+Naked+Communist+%5Bgraybeard1250%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a98f99631567976f14c6e2fe9422104b2189ac22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,143,153,99,21,103,151,111,20,198,226,254,148,34,16,75,33,137,172,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
