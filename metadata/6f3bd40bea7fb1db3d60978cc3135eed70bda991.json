Frank Baum. The series was planned to start September 1, 2002 but was cancelled, perhaps because the special effects required for each episode would have been too expensive.[citation needed] The pilot was made, but not released to television. An unfinished (some of the special effects are not complete) version has leaked onto DVD and VHS and has been sold many times on the bootlegger's market, and has since appeared on YouTube.\n\nThe pilot was written by David Hayter, screenwriter of the first two X-Men films, and directed by Mick Garris. Many fans erroneously assume that Tim Burton was involved with this production, as Burton was going to make a movie called Lost in Oz in 2000, but the project was shelved before it was filmed. It does seem that the story was reused for this TV pilot.\n\nContrary to some fans' ideas, Lost in Oz was in no way based on or referred to Disney's Return to Oz.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309176/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309176/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f3bd40bea7fb1db3d60978cc3135eed70bda991","amp;dn":"Lost.In.Oz.2002.Unsold.Pilot.WEBRip.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f3bd40bea7fb1db3d60978cc3135eed70bda991","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,59,212,11,234,127,177,219,61,96,151,140,195,19,94,237,112,189,169,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
