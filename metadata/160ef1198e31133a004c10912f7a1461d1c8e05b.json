A message, &quot;He Is Coming&quot;, written in blood on the victim's window is a dark, forboding clue of his task. After two more victims with missing body parts are discovered, Prudhomme realizes he is on the trail of a serial killer who is using the missing body parts to reconstruct the body of Christ...just in time for Easter. As Prudhomme struggles to catch the zealot-murderer, he is haunted by the death of his son, his continued estrangement from his wife, and his wavering faith in God.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:160ef1198e31133a004c10912f7a1461d1c8e05b","amp;dn":"Resurrection+%5B1999%5D.ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"160ef1198e31133a004c10912f7a1461d1c8e05b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,14,241,25,142,49,19,58,0,76,16,145,47,122,20,97,209,200,224,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
