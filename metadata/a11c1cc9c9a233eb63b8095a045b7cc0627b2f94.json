I tried it for first time and it works. So how to?\n\nDownload free program HexEdit &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/10658&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/10658&lt;/a&gt;\n\nClick on OmniFocus.app (this 1.5 version) and find this file:\nOmniFocus.app &gt; Contents &gt; MacOS &gt; OmniFocus\n..open this file with HexEdit\n\nThen use Find function in HexEdit - here use hex mode.\n(there is also ascii mode)\n..find this:\n0f84630b0000\n..replace it with this:\n0f85630b0000\n\n..then save changes and run OmniFocus 1.5 cracked by yourself. It works for me. The only think - dont run licence manager in menu - the OmniFocus crashes, but you can run it again.\n\nTurn off automatic updates in preferences.\n\nAND ONE THING: IT TAKES LONG TIME FOR NEW OMNIFOCUS TO BACKUP DATABASE AND UPGRADE TO NEW ONE.
