And I'm telling you: I hate rats. Of course, backed by those five brass-blasting human Neutrinos, Lucia, marking her 13th year leading these swing bandits, is even better equipped to burn it up all night long. A doe-eyed, big-voiced wonder who manages to channel Betty Boop, Bettie Page and Billie Holiday, Lucia is throwback flirty with a pooched bottom lip and a pleasant penchant to let the men in her life solo till they're red in the face.\nOn the group's third album, Ingrid &amp; Co. pay rowdy homage to all those beloved people and places in their hometown New Orleans. (The show was recorded in the historic Old Point Bar, which is a nice step up from the group's original jam space: a rickety houseboat that threatened to sink into the Ol' Muddy.) The only thing better than listening to Lucia is watching her-but this ain't a DVD, so too bad, buster. Of course, the brunette beauty sounds quite splendid leading her boys through such Dixieland stomp and jump-blues numbers as &quot;Bourbon Street Parade,&quot; &quot;Caldonia&quot; and &quot;Blues Around Midnight.&quot; She's also smart enough to know that hard-blowin' trumpeter James Andrews and super-fingered guitarist John Fohl should be allowed to show off whenever they damn well please. If she only had some nutria up there with her, now that would be a show. (JazzTimes)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Bourbon Street Parade\n02 - Caldonia\n03 - Since My Bird Has Flied Away\n04 - Sugar To Tea\n05 - St. James Infirmary\n06 - Blues My Naughty Sweetie Gives to Me\n07 - You Don't Know Me\n08 - Running Wild\n09 - My Honey's Lovin Arms\n10 - Blues Around Midnight\n\nEnjoy and share!
