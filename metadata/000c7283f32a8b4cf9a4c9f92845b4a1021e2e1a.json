The roster was composed of classic characters such as: 3-D Man (Delroy Garrett), Gorilla Man (Kenneth Hale), Human Robot (M-11), Namora (Aquaria Neptunia), the Uranian (Robert Grayson), Venus, and Jimmy Woo. Artist Leonard Kirk joined him for the various series using this group, the details of which can be found in the links above.\n\nThis pack contains all of the major appearances of the squad featured in their own comics, including:\n\n-Agents of Atlas v1 01-06 (2006-2007, Limited Series)\n-Dark Reign: Agents of Atlas v2 01-11 (2009, Ongoing Series)\n-Atlas 01-05 (2010, Ongoing Series - cancelled after issue 5)\n-X-Men vs. Agents of Atlas 01-02 (2009-2010, Two-Shot)\n-The Avengers vs. Atlas 01-04 (2010, Miniseries)\n\nAs a bonus, I have also included the story that served as the inspiration/introduction to the concept, What If? v1 09 - What If The Avengers Had Fought Evil In The 1950's? (June 1978). All scans are from high quality Minutemen sources unless otherwise noted (Bertha-DCP) or left blank, in which case I didn't know who to credit. Thanks so much to the various scanners and original uploaders, your work is definitely appreciated. Please seed, and enjoy! :-)\n\nThis torrent fills a request by MegamanHD.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:000c7283f32a8b4cf9a4c9f92845b4a1021e2e1a","amp;dn":"The+Agents+of+Atlas+Collection+%2B+Ex+%282006-2010%2C+MM%2BDCP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"000c7283f32a8b4cf9a4c9f92845b4a1021e2e1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,12,114,131,243,42,139,76,249,164,201,249,40,69,180,161,2,30,46,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
