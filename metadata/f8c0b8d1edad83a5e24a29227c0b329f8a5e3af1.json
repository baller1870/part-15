That is progress not envisioned by the creators of The Jetsons . . . \n\nYoung adults party in south Florida, and the deformed man whom they mock devises a means of transforming himself into a jellyfish. Some of the most ridiculous monster effects ever filmed, combined with vivid, colorful photography and some very beautiful, terrorized young women, resulting in one of the most entertaining &quot;bad films&quot; imaginable.\n\nStarring Joe Morrison, Valerie Hawkins, and John Vella as Egon, the half-man, half-jellyfish!\n\nNeil Sedaka provides the bouncy theme song &quot;Do the Jellyfish!&quot; You can't miss it.\n\nMPEG-4 from DVD rip, recoded with Nero Digital\nResolution 560x416\n23.978 frames per second\nAspect ratio 4:3\nAudio: AAC-HE\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8c0b8d1edad83a5e24a29227c0b329f8a5e3af1","amp;dn":"Sting+of+Death","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8c0b8d1edad83a5e24a29227c0b329f8a5e3af1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,192,184,209,237,173,131,165,226,74,41,34,124,11,50,159,138,94,58,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
