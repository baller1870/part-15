The strength of the film is a huge number of clips from a vast range of films which show that, after a fairly liberal early period, homophobia reigned supreme until the late 1960s, and still can be seen in mainstream movies today. One of the great gay clichÃƒÂ©s is the homosexual movie buff in love with the likes of Judy Garland, so it is ironic that so many gay people should turn to the Hollywood product for distraction, given how anti-gay that product was. Some of the industry people interviewed for the film boast of how the censors were outsmarted on occasion, for example Gore Vidal's account of how Charlton Heston was fooled into acting gay in &quot;Ben Hur&quot;, but it was not until &quot;Boys in the Band&quot;, the film of a successful stage play in 1970, that homosexuality broke through as a topic for candid treatment.\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nVideo                        : DVD-5\nAudio                        : English (2.0 Dolby Stereo)\nSubtitles                    : English, Bulgarian\nFormat                       : MPEG Video\nWidth                        : 720 pixels\nHeight                       : 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio         : 16:9\nFrame rate                   : 25.000 fps\nStandard                     : NTSC\nMenu                         : Yes\nCredits                      : Yes\nRuntime:                     : 102 min\nBONUS:                       : DVD-Cover\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2882fca94afda9b85759e5e86b55e8b66298f31","amp;dn":"The+Celluloid+Closet+%281995%29+%28Documentary.DVD5.NTSC.Subs.En.Bg%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2882fca94afda9b85759e5e86b55e8b66298f31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,136,47,202,148,175,218,155,133,117,158,94,134,181,94,139,102,41,143,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
