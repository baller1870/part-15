At one extremity of an open space, hemmed in by the dark  wall of the forest, arose a rock, bearing some rude, natural resemblance  either to an alter or a pulpit, and surrounded by four blazing pines,  their tops aflame, their stems untouched, like candles at an evening  meeting. The mass of foliage that had overgrown the summit of the rock  was all on fire, blazing high into the night and fitfully illuminating  the whole field. Each pendent twig and leafy festoon was in a blaze. As  the red light arose and fell, a numerous congregation alternately shone  forth, then disappeared in shadow, and again grew, as it were, out of  the darkness, peopling the heart of the solitary woods at once. &quot;A grave  and dark-clad company,&quot; quoth Goodman Brown. In truth they were such.\n\nAudible Audio Edition\nListening Length: 34 minutes\nProgram Type: Audiobook\nVersion: Unabridged\nPublisher: PC Treasures, Inc.\nAudible.com Release Date: January 24, 2008\nLanguage: English\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
