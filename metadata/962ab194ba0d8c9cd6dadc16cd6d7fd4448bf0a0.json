But when not on set, she is usually throwing a dinner party or entertaining at home. In fact, Ali has been cooking and entertaining all her life, and in an instant, she can whip together a wonderful meal, whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s for a family Sunday brunch, a spontaneous Super Bowl party, or an elegant (but not stuffy) New YearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Eve dinner. Her parties seem effortless, but it hasn't always been that easy for her. In fact, at AliÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first dinner party, she made the common rookie mistake of putting too much pressure on herself to make things perfect. Needless to say, with hungry guests, a burned hand, a broken air conditioner, and a mouse scampering across her fourth-floor New York City walk-up, the night ended in disaster.\nThrough the years of trial and error, Ali has learned that while looking effortless takes some effort, cooking is not about being perfectÃ¢â‚¬â€it's about having a great time! And now sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eager to share her passion and knowledge for cooking, collecting her favorite go-to menus into this wonderful cookbook: from her jalapeÃƒÂ±o cheddar cornbread to crab pots with lemon caper dip, lamb chop lollipops, strawberry mint cake, and for thirsty revelers, her eucalyptus gin martinis.\nAli's mouthwatering recipes and inspiring party ideas are broken down by month so you can take her lead through the seasons with celebrations such as an October Harvest Party, a January Detox, and a July Americana BBQ. Brimming with charm, beautiful and intimate photos, and Ali's personal touch as a perfectly disheveled, sassy, effortless host, Kitchen Revelry will enliven and inspire your celebrations for years to come.\n\nAbout the Author\nALI LARTER is an actress and year-round reveler. She lives in Los Angeles, where she hosts her ritual dinner parties and legendary get-togethers. Ali shares her celebrations with her husband, Hayes MacArthur; her son, Teddy; Jackpot, the shepherd; and Ella, the wheaton.\n\nCONTENTS\nINTRODUCTION\nseptember- Cooking School, Savoring the Last Bites of Summer\noctober - Harvest Party, Full Moon Party\njanuary - Detox, Wanderlust Supper\nfebruary - Sweethearts SoirÃƒÂ©e, Super Bowl Party\nmay - Earth MotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Brunch, Bar Was a Bust\njune - Wine Tasting Evening, El Diablo\nnovember - Out-of-Town Guests, Friends Thanksgiving\ndecember - Tree-Trimming Cocktail Party, New YearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Eve Dinner\nmarch - Movie Night Meals, Slumber Party\napril - Alfresco Lunch, Spring Clothing Swap\njuly - Americana BBQ, Dinner at Dusk\naugust - Midsummer NightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dream, Tuesday Night, No Reason\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nINDEX","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:962ab194ba0d8c9cd6dadc16cd6d7fd4448bf0a0","amp;dn":"Kitchen+Revelry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"962ab194ba0d8c9cd6dadc16cd6d7fd4448bf0a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,42,177,148,186,13,140,156,214,218,220,22,205,109,127,212,68,139,240,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
