Gluten-Free 101 is the guide to help make the transition a simple and positive change. It explains how to select and work with the best g-free foods from a now extensive (and sometimes confusing) product shelf, how to continue eating healthfully, and how to master basic gluten-free cooking techniques, such as cooking g-free pasta and rolling g-free dough. There are 175 simple recipes for everyday favorites like pancakes, pizza, fried chicken, sandwich bread, and cupcakes, with more than twenty-five beautiful recipe photos. Going gluten-free can be fun and delicious!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d14f4692856cdacc2206207a0e4bc9e4673b00c4","amp;dn":"GlutenFree.101.The.Essential.Beginners.Guide.to.Easy.GlutenFree.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d14f4692856cdacc2206207a0e4bc9e4673b00c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,79,70,146,133,108,218,204,34,6,32,122,14,75,201,228,103,59,0,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
