BRAWL SOUNDTRACK RE-RELEASE\n\n- by Mit. Original game rip by Xane -\n\n- all tracks 128kbps (sounds fine due to compressed nature of songs on game disc) -\n\nThis version has songs with MP3 tags taken straight from Brawl's Sound Test, including correct song titles, original game reference, remix composer, and more. It also has album artwork for every individual category, compressed and more detailed categories, completely redone file names, songs that were cropped due to poor loop transitions, and extended versions of songs that were previously cut to make looped versions for Brawl.\n\nThere are 297 songs spread across 22 albums, with a total running time of over 14 hours, and a little bit over 1GB in file size. The songs are ordered within their respective albums chronologically, according to how old their original game references are (ex: Super Mario Bros. songs come before Mario Sunshine songs). The albums are split up in order according to how Brawl often places the different game series in a heirarchy (displayed by the songs' original locations on the Brawl disc, and by Brawl's sound test).\n\n\n\nTo get an idea for how the MP3 tags are laid out, here are the different tags included and what's included inside of them:\n\nTrack title | Artist | Album | Year | Genre | Composer\n\n- Track name (taken from Brawl's Sound Test) - Original game reference (ex: Ending - Yoshi's Story)\n\n- Super Smash Bros. Brawl\n\n- Album letter - Album name (ex: A - Mario)\n\n- 2008\n\n- Video Game Music\n\n- Remix composer name (for tracks exclusively remixed for Brawl by famous composers) OR 'Original' to denote a song ported from a previous game (this is exactly how Brawl's Sound Test lays out composers)\n\n\nFile names are laid out like so, within their respective album folder:\n\nTrack Number - Original Game Reference - Track Name (ex: 01 - Super Mario Bros. - Ground Theme)\n\n\nThis release also features many songs that were either cut down, or extended to offer a better listening experience. Xane originally ripped every song from the game to loop one time, then begin a second loop and fade out.  However, some songs were just plain not meant to loop very well, such as Ai no Uta (it's just a normal song that ends normally... then it begins again for its loop), and some songs can just drag on for way too long when looped, such as the previous Main Theme of Metroid that extended past 7 and a half minutes. These songs have been cropped to either have non-looping endings (Ai no Uta just finishes when the actual song finishes playing once), or they have been cropped to only play through once, and it fades out during the second loop's beginning.\n\nSome songs were cut down by Brawl to put them into a looping form, mostly songs coming from other games, such as a lot of the Sonic songs (like Live &amp; Learn and Open Your Heart). I have included extended versions of these songs from my own collection of soundtracks so that you can fully enjoy these tracks without the rather abrupt loops that the Brawl versions contained.\n\n\n\nThis release contains all the info about all of these songs you could ask for. If you disagree with how some of the tags are set up or organized, you have everything available to you to switch around and mess with until it's arranged to your liking. Right now, it's set up so that you can very easily add this to your music library or iPod without having to mess with anything at all.\n\nHappy downloading and enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:893da348fdfc3941e7d939e20233384c85d1bb1c","amp;dn":"Super+Smash+Bros.+Brawl+Original+Soundtrack+%28Game+Rip%29+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"893da348fdfc3941e7d939e20233384c85d1bb1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,61,163,72,253,252,57,65,231,217,57,226,2,51,56,76,133,209,187,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
