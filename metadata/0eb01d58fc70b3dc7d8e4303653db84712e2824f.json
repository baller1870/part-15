The torrent contains issues 1 - 6. There is allegedly an issue 0, but I was unable to locate a scan of it.\n\nAlso included in the torrent is the follow-up story Kid Kosmos - Kidnapped published by Dynamite Entertainment in 2006.\n\nThis is the kind of cosmic storyline you would expect from the mind and hand of Jim Starlin.\n\nThanks to the scanners and the original sources who shall remain nameless.\n\nPlease seed. Please enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0eb01d58fc70b3dc7d8e4303653db84712e2824f","amp;dn":"Jim+Starlin%5C%27s+Cosmic+Guard+%2B+Kid+Kosmos+GN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0eb01d58fc70b3dc7d8e4303653db84712e2824f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,176,29,88,252,112,179,220,125,142,67,3,101,61,184,71,18,226,130,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
