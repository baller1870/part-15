In The Morning\n02. Past Last Summer\n03. Days Gone By\n04. i-ju-raida\n05. Shinin Days\n06. More Fun?\n07. A.F.O.K\n08. Here Comes Your Man\n09. Maybe Go Better\n10. California\n11. Far From Your Mind\n12. No Rock N Roll Radio\n13. All Fun Of Kids\n\nRipped at 320kbps.\n\nMostly known for their song Tell Me Why, which was used as the opening theme song to the anime Berserk, there is not much other exposure of this, now-defunct, punk rock group within America. Therefore, I grant the public with the releases I have slowly begun to acquire.\n\nEnjoy and please seed as long as possible.
