And I never planned to pass that great age. But I am so glad to have been around to be a part of the celebration that this record represents. And it is a celebration. Not so much of Jack Bruce the musician or survivor. I believe all the great people who took part in this event were celebrating the music - and the wonder of music is that while you may grow older, music stays forever young. Thank you so very much my wonderful friends. I know we will meet again soon - in the safest place in the world.\n(Jack Bruce, 10 December 1993)\n\n- - -\n\nJack Bruce - Cities of the Heart - The 50th Birthday Concerts 1993\n(2CD CMP Records)\n\n 1.
