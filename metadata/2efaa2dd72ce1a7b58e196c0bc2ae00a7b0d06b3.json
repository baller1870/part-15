This new edition adds Chief Shaun LaDue as a contributor to give a practitioner's perspective to management and supervision. Additionally, the text has an increased emphasis on leadership and has been reorganized to begin the text focusing on management. The text focuses on post-9/11 policing and includes research on the effects of 9/11 as well as data driven policing, including CompStat policing, inteligence-led policing and evidence based policing. The text also includes discussions on the effects of the current economic crisis on law enforcement, including two 2009 PERF studies and reports. MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION IN LAW ENFORCEMENT, 6th edition presents a comprehensive overview of the responsibilities of law enforcement leaders and covers everything from the newest principles in policing to the exciting technological aids changing the face of law enforcement today, preparing readers to become tomorrow's leaders. \n\n\n\n# Karen M.
