A truce is reached, but it's not exactly resolved. More unresolved issues are addressed when Lisa throws a tea party in her beautiful olive grove, and it's the first time Adrienne and Brandi have faced each other since their big blow-up. It's civil at first, but denials and accusations fly when a tipsy Taylor asks whether or not Adrienne is suing Brandi.\n\n\n\n\nA huge Thanks to RKSTR for capping and sharing!\n\nEnjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b07b8e6675fef1a5ba1076888c74f2730307b29","amp;dn":"The.Real.Housewives.Of.Beverly.Hills.S03E13.HDTV.x264-RKSTR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b07b8e6675fef1a5ba1076888c74f2730307b29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,7,184,230,103,95,239,26,91,161,7,104,136,199,79,39,48,48,123,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
