But her happiness is short-lived when Reef appears at her house covered in blood. A fellow snowboarder has been killed--but despite the evidence, Reef swears he's innocent. And Piper believes him.\n\nDeputy Landon Grainger loves the McKennas like family, but he's also sworn to find the truth. Piper is frustrated with his need for facts over faith, but he knows those closest to you have the power to deceive you the most. With his sheriff pushing for a quick conviction, some unexpected leads complicate the investigation, and pursuing the truth may mean risking Landon's career.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80a2f52749515e14e924fdac3c48f0c03af90519","amp;dn":"Dani+Pettrey-Shattered","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80a2f52749515e14e924fdac3c48f0c03af90519","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,162,245,39,73,81,94,20,233,36,253,172,60,72,240,192,58,249,5,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
