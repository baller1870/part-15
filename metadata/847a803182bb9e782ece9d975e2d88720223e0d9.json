Aira has published over eighty short books of stories, novels and essays. In fact, at least since 1993 a hallmark of his work is an almost frenetic level of writing and publicationÃ¢â‚¬â€two to four novella-length books each year. He has lectured at the University of Buenos Aires, on Copi and Arthur Rimbaud, and at the University of Rosario on Constructivism and StÃƒÂ©phane MallarmÃƒÂ©, and has translated and edited books from France, England, Italy, Brazil, Spain, Mexico, and Venezuela.\n\nWhile his subject matter ranges from Surrealist or Dadaist quasi-nonsense to fantastic tales set in his Buenos Aires neighborhood of Flores, Aira also returns frequently to ArgentinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nineteenth century (two books translated into English, The Hare and An Episode in the Life of a Landscape Painter, are examples of this; so is the best-known novel of his early years, Ema la cautiva (Emma, the Captive)). He also returns regularly to play with stereotypes of an exotic East, such as in Una novela china, (A Chinese Novel); El volante (The Flyer), and El pequeÃƒÂ±o monje budista (The Little Buddhist Monk). Aira also enjoys mocking himself and his childhood home town, Coronel Pringles, in fictions such as CÃƒÂ³mo me hice monja (How I Became a Nun), CÃƒÂ³mo me reÃƒÂ­ (How I Laughed), El cerebro musical (The Musical Brain) and Las curas milagrosas del doctor Aira (The Miraculous Cures of Dr. Aira). His novella La prueba (1992) served as the basisÃ¢â‚¬â€or point of departure, as only the first half-hour follows the novellaÃ¢â‚¬â€of Diego Lerman's film Tan de repente (Suddenly) (2002). His novel CÃƒÂ³mo me hice monja (How I Became a Nun) was selected as one of the ten best publications in Spain in the year 1998.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains all the books in ePUB format:\n\n* An Episode in the Life of a Landscape Painter \n\n* Ghosts\n \n* How I Became a Nun\n\n* Literary Conference\n\n* Miracle Cures of Dr. Aira\n\n* Shantytown\n\n* The Hare\n\n* The Seamstress and the Wind\n\n* The Spy\n\n* Varamo\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Aira&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Aira&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://quarterlyconversation.com/cesar-aira-how-i-became-a-nun&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://quarterlyconversation.com/cesar-aira-how-i-became-a-nun&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://lareviewofbooks.org/essay/chasing-ghosts-on-argentinian-author-cesar-aira&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://lareviewofbooks.org/essay/chasing-ghosts-on-argentinian-author-cesar-aira&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/this-week-in-fiction-chris-andrews-on-csar-aira&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/this-week-in-fiction-chris-andrews-on-csar-aira&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bombmagazine.org/article/3224/c-sar-aira&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bombmagazine.org/article/3224/c-sar-aira&lt;/a&gt;\n\n===================================================================================\n\nI'm highly indebted to &quot;workerbee&quot; in creating this torrent.
