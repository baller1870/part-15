Some revisionists have tried to cast him as a sort of early blue-eyed soul figure, although he was probably more aligned with pop/rock, at first as the lead singer of the Belmonts, and then as a solo star. Drug problems slowed him down in the mid-'60s, yet he made some surprisingly interesting progressions into blues-rock and folk-rock as the decade wore on, culminating in a successful comeback in the late '60s, although he was unable to sustain its commercial and artistic momentum for long. ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:3ifpxqe5ldhe~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:3ifpxqe5ldhe~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nThere are countless Dion &amp; the Belmonts compilations on the market and this one isn't that different than any of them, but it does include the essential early hits, all recorded between 1958 and 1963 for Laurie Records, like &quot;Runaround Sue,&quot; &quot;I Wonder Why,&quot; &quot;A Teenager in Love,&quot; &quot;The Wanderer,&quot; &quot;Lovers Who Wander,&quot; and &quot;Where or When,&quot; so for the casual listener at least, this set will most likely do the trick. There's a lot more to the story than these 18 tracks, though.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:3cfwxq85ldte&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:3cfwxq85ldte&lt;/a&gt;\n\nReviews here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/Wanderer-Dion-Belmonts/dp/B00000DV5Z&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Wanderer-Dion-Belmonts/dp/B00000DV5Z&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
