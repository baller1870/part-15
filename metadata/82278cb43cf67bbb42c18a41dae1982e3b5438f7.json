SheÃ‚â€™s focused on building her business, which leaves little time for datingÃ‚â€”not that she needs a romantic entanglement to fulfill her. When her friend signs up for a self-defense class as part of her recovery after an attack, Amery joins her for support. ThatÃ‚â€™s where she meets him.\n\nRonin Black, owner of the dojo, is so drawn to Amery that he takes over her trainingÃ‚â€”in public and in private. The enigmatic Ronin pushes AmeryÃ‚â€™s boundaries from the start, and with each new tryst, Amery becomes addicted to the pleasure and to him. But when Amery senses Ronin is hiding something, she questions her total trust in him, despite the undeniable thrill of his possession?.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82278cb43cf67bbb42c18a41dae1982e3b5438f7","amp;dn":"Bound+%28Mastered+%231%29+by+Lorelei+James.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82278cb43cf67bbb42c18a41dae1982e3b5438f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,39,140,180,60,246,123,187,66,193,138,65,218,225,152,46,59,84,56,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
