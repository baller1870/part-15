Joe McGann's Fiddle/Center's Bonnet\n\nOPENING MOVES is a fine sampler of the Battlefield Band's earliest material. The original albums from which these songs have been culled--THE BATTLEFIELD BAND (1977), AT THE FRONT (1978), and STAND EASY (1979)--were long available only on vinyl (STAND EASY has since been re-released on CD). While featuring variations in the group's personnel, the compilation retains the Band's top-notch musicianship and sense of musical tradition.\n\nThe contributions of Jamie McMenemy (cittern, mandolin, whistles, bouzouki and vocals), and Irish guitarist, vocalist, and bodhran player Pat Kilbride are especially notable on story-ballads such as &quot;The Shipyard Apprentice&quot; and &quot;The Lady Leroy.&quot; Elsewhere, Scottish reels and Irish jigs are given sprightly, energetic treatments, as on &quot;Silver Spear/Humours of Tulla,&quot; and the trio of dance themes that includes &quot;My Wife's a Wanton Wee Thing.&quot; Also impressive here (in addition to the musicianship of founders Brian MacNeill and Alan Reid, whose work can be heard on later Battlefield efforts) are John Gahagan's tin whistle playing and Duncan MacGillvray's moving Highland pipes. Taken together, these 17 cuts provide an overview of the group's early oeuvre, showing why they became one of the mainstays of Scotland's progressive folk scene.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03c128d87295c2b110c6f50f110d691339505f98","amp;dn":"Battlefield+Band+-+Opening+Moves+%5B1993%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03c128d87295c2b110c6f50f110d691339505f98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,193,40,216,114,149,194,177,16,198,245,15,17,13,105,19,57,80,95,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
