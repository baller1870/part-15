If you've ever watched one of these tournaments in real life, you know just how vicious the competition gets; no moves are off limits, making for some disturbing results. This game lets you choose your combatant from a list of 25 heavy hitters (including Tito Ortiz, the 2001 light heavyweight champion), each of which has own fighting style. Every technique from street brawling to the most advanced martial arts is represented here, which allows for a creative approach. You can create your own brawler from scratch, choosing tattoos, builds, moves, and more. Once you're ready to rumble, choose to play in Arcade, Tournament, UFC, Champion modes, or play in Career mode, which allows for complete tournament customization. You can play against the computer or challenge a friend to a head-to-head showdown.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c143bf2d3ae3f56bc5c8c4b6a82b9810af0bcc17","amp;dn":"UFC+Throwdown+%28PS2%29+%28PAL%29+%28Fabio5ilva%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c143bf2d3ae3f56bc5c8c4b6a82b9810af0bcc17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,67,191,45,58,227,245,107,197,200,196,182,168,43,152,16,175,11,204,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
