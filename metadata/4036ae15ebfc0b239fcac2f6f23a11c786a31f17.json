The group was initially signed by Dr. Strange Records and were then signed to Fat Wreck Chords. Face to Face rose to fame with their 1994 second album Big Choice, featuring their radio hit &quot;Disconnected&quot;, which was first played by KROQ and appeared in the movies Tank Girl and National Lampoon's Senior Trip. The band declined in popularity after the departure of founding drummer Rob Kurth, who left in 1998.\n\nDuring their initial twelve year run, Face to Face became one of the seminal and influential punk rock bands to come out of California, along with Blink-182, Green Day, Bad Religion, The Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise, No Use for a Name, Lagwagon, The Vandals, Guttermouth, Good Riddance, and many others.\n\nFace to Face split up in September 2004, because of musical differences. Since then, all the members of the band had played in a number of post-Face to Face projects, including Legion of Doom, Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, The Offspring and Saves the Day. In April 2008, Face to Face performed together for the first time in five years at The Glasshouse in Pomona, California.[1] The band has continued to perform numerous live venues since.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Turn Away 1992\n\n\n\nDon't Turn Away is the first album by the band Face to Face. It was released in 1992 (see 1992 in music) under the label Dr. Strange Records, and was considered a strong debut for the band. It was re-released a year later on Fat Wreck Chords. Two years later, &quot;Disconnected&quot;, the album's third track, was re-recorded for the band's second album Big Choice. Their then-label A&amp;M Records wanted the band to re-record it, because no one could &quot;hear a single&quot; until the L.A. radio station KROQ first played it.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;You've Done Nothing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:59\n2.\t&quot;I'm Not Afraid&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:44\n3.\t&quot;Disconnected&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27\n4.\t&quot;No Authority&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:42\n5.\t&quot;I Want&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:00\n6.\t&quot;You've Got a Problem&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:47\n7.\t&quot;Everything is Everything&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:08\n8.\t&quot;I'm Trying&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:52\n9.\t&quot;Pastel&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:13\n10.\t&quot;Nothing New&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26\n11.\t&quot;Walk Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:09\n12.\t&quot;Do You Care?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:01\n13.\t&quot;1,000 X&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBig Choice 1995\n\n\nBig Choice is the second full-length album by the California punk band Face to Face in 1994. The original version of the album was released on Victory Music and re-released on A&amp;M Records in 1995.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Struggle&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:07\n2.\t&quot;I Know You Well&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:42\n3.\t&quot;Sensible&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:58\n4.\t&quot;A-OK&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:57\n5.\t&quot;You Lied&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27\n6.\t&quot;Promises&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:15\n7.\t&quot;Big Choice&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24\n8.\t&quot;It's Not Over&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:26\n9.\t&quot;Velocity&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:17\n10.\t&quot;Debt&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:19\n11.\t&quot;Late&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37\n12.\t(blank) * ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:16\n13.\t&quot;Disconnected&quot; * ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20\n14.\t&quot;Bikeage&quot; * (cover of Descendents) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:09\n\nThe '*' marks indicate that it's a bonus track. Those songs were featured on the 1995 re-release as bonus tracks. The original pressing had just the first eleven tracks. The twelfth track is sometimes referred to as &quot;Untitled&quot; or &quot;Song 12&quot;, but is actually titled as blank. The track features a conversation about re-recording &quot;Disconnected&quot;, which originally appeared on their first album Don't Turn Away and would be the following track on this album, because no one could &quot;hear a single&quot; until KROQ first played it. However, the track is not featured on the track listing from the back cover of the album. Rock poster artist Jim Evans (T.A.Z.), worked closely with the band to create the unique album art featuring the &quot;Big Choice&quot; game machine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFace to Face 1996\n\n\nFace to Face is the 1996 self-titled fourth album by the California punk band Face to Face. This album was their major label (A&amp;M) debut after leaving their previous label Victory Records from Big Choice. The art on the album jacket is similar to the art on the Black Flag album Damaged.\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Resignation&quot; - 3:48\n2.\t&quot;Walk the Walk&quot; - 3:35\n3.\t&quot;Blind&quot; - 2:43\n4.\t&quot;Ordinary&quot; - 2:48\n5.\t&quot;I Won't Lie Down&quot; - 3:18\n6.\t&quot;Can't Change the World&quot; - 2:13\n7.\t&quot;Handout&quot; - 3:37\n8.\t&quot;Everything's Your Fault&quot; - 2:49\n9.\t&quot;Take It Back&quot; - 2:59\n10.\t&quot;Complicated&quot; - 4:02\n11.\t&quot;Put You in Your Place&quot; - 3:42\n12.\t&quot;Falling&quot; - 3:01\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4036ae15ebfc0b239fcac2f6f23a11c786a31f17","amp;dn":"Face+to+Face+-+3+albums+1992+-+1996+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4036ae15ebfc0b239fcac2f6f23a11c786a31f17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,54,174,21,235,252,11,35,159,202,194,246,242,58,17,199,134,163,31,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
