There is certainly a definite Malian lilt to his delivery as well as in the instrumentation and straightforward arrangements, and at times he displays the same bluesy penchant as Ali Farka Toure, albeit less stridently. Koite tilts toward a very contemporary, almost Western interpretation of his spiritual songs, with an overall folksiness softening the unmistakable African roots of his music. The result is a highly textured airy excursion that makes, with his dusty, soulful vocals, a highly appealing album of great introspective sincerity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abd58c3194f0050743b1595af7cdb2510724cd97","amp;dn":"Habib+Koite+%26amp%3B+Bamada+-+Ma+Ya+%281998%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abd58c3194f0050743b1595af7cdb2510724cd97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,213,140,49,148,240,5,7,67,177,89,90,247,205,178,81,7,36,205,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
