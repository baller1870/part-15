While the information itself is easy to understand, the AuthorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clear message is that we, as individuals, can control our susceptibility to Cancer, eliminate Cancer cells and prevent and avoid the disease by controlling and neutralizing, rather than unwittingly nourishing, the bodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s natural Cancer cells and their growth.\n\nNatalie Mitchell is an international consulting Nutritionist specializing in cancer prevention and recovery for her clients. For over a decade she has counseled both the healthy and those with Cancer on how to achieve prevention as well as recovery through optimized daily nutrition and diet.\n\nIn Ã¢â‚¬Å“How To Kill Cancer CellsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ms. Mitchell shares her extensive knowledge and understanding of the extraordinary power of diet and nutrition in preventing and neutralizing Cancer. Her book includes chapters of specific practical advice for those who wish to take an active and personal role in making sure they remain Cancer-free, backed up with frequent reference to research papers from both mainstream and alternative medical sources.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b91ce698640783c4570221c01214a4974257463","amp;dn":"How+To+Kill+Cancer+Cells+-+Natalie+Mitchell.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b91ce698640783c4570221c01214a4974257463","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,145,206,105,134,64,120,60,69,112,34,28,1,33,74,73,116,37,116,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
