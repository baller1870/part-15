But as the political firestorm mounts, a call for help arrives from Thule, a highly-developed world facing a major insurgency in the wake of the EmpireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s collapse. Reluctantly, the Commonwealth deploys the Commonwealth Expeditionary Force to Thule.\n\nBut all is not as it seems. The insurgents are receiving support from off-world powers, while bare light years across the border, Wolfbane Ã¢â‚¬â€œ another successor state to the vanished Empire Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is preparing for war ... and an old enemy plots her revenge. As the countdown to war begins, the CEF finds itself sinking in a quagmire of bitter hatred ...\n\n... And nothing more than pawns in a very deadly game. \n\n\n\nRead by Jeffrey Kafer\nDuration : 12h 14mn\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b4af4d65ee8155ff5a979038f0d5ff042316b4b","amp;dn":"Christopher+G.+Nuttall+-+Retreat+Hell+%28The+Empire%27s+Corps+%238%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b4af4d65ee8155ff5a979038f0d5ff042316b4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,74,244,214,94,232,21,95,245,169,121,3,143,13,95,240,66,49,107,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
