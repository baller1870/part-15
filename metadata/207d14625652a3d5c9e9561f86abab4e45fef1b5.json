Also if you use your PC to watch it, installing LAV Filter will help you a lot if you want to use KMPlayer or PotPlayer. However, MPC-HC (preferably in K-Lite Media Codec Pack) is the recommended. Many updated players have native support for the codec. To play on Android, use MX Player","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:207d14625652a3d5c9e9561f86abab4e45fef1b5","amp;dn":"PixAndVideo+Ally+Breelsen+urist+In+Trouble+720p+HEVC+x265","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"207d14625652a3d5c9e9561f86abab4e45fef1b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,125,20,98,86,82,163,213,201,233,86,31,134,171,171,78,69,254,241,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
