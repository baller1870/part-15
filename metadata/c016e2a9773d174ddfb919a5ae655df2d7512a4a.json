These are the courageous men and women who forge headfirst into danger when everyone else is running the other way. But the enormous responsibilities of the job also take a personal toll.\n\nWith big reputations and hefty egos, the pressure to perform and make split-second decisions is bound to put squad members at odds. When a tragedy claims one of their own, there's plenty of guilt and blame to go around. In the middle of a divorce, Lt. Matthew Casey tries to go about business as usual, but can't help butting heads with the brash Lt. Kelly Severide of the Rescue Squad - and each blames the other for their fallen team member. When it's &quot;go-time,&quot; though, they put their differences aside and put everything on the line for each other. This is a look inside one of America's noblest professions.\n\nFrom renowned Emmy-winning producer Dick Wolf and the writing team behind &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot; comes an edge-of-your-seat view of a dirty job that often means the difference between life and death.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c016e2a9773d174ddfb919a5ae655df2d7512a4a","amp;dn":"Chicago.Fire.S02E05.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c016e2a9773d174ddfb919a5ae655df2d7512a4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,22,226,169,119,61,23,77,223,185,25,165,174,101,93,242,215,81,42,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
