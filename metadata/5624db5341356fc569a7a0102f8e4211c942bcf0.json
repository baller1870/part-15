It marks their first line-up change since 1983; guitarist Adrian Smith left the band during the pre-production phase, unhappy with the musical direction it was taking, and only having contributed to one song, &quot;Hooks in You&quot;. Smith was replaced by Janick Gers, who had previously worked with singer Bruce Dickinson on his first solo-album, Tattooed Millionaire, and had also worked with Ian Gillan, former Marillion singer Fish, and New Wave of British Heavy Metal band, White Spirit.\n\nAlthough it received generally mixed to negative reviews, the album peaked at No. 2 in the UK Albums Chart and contains the band's only UK Singles Chart No. 1, &quot;Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter&quot;.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t\n1. \t&quot;Tailgunner&quot;   \t \t                   4:15\n2. \t&quot;Holy Smoke&quot;   \t\t                   3:49\n3. \t&quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot;   \t\t   4:23\n4. \t&quot;Public Enema Number One&quot;    \t           4:13\n5. \t&quot;Fates Warning&quot;   \t \t           4:12 \t\n6. \t&quot;The Assassin&quot;   \t\t           4:35\n7. \t&quot;Run Silent Run Deep&quot;   \t\t   4:34\n8. \t&quot;Hooks in You&quot;   \t\t           4:08\n9. \t&quot;Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter&quot;  4:45\n10. \t&quot;Mother Russia&quot;   \t \t           5:31\n\nTotal length:                                      44:25\n\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5624db5341356fc569a7a0102f8e4211c942bcf0","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+%281990%29+No+Prayer+For+The+Dying+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovati","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5624db5341356fc569a7a0102f8e4211c942bcf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,36,219,83,65,53,111,197,105,167,160,16,47,142,66,17,201,66,188,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
