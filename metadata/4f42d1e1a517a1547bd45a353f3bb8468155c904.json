Extensive use is made of the inverse distribution function and a deÃ¯Â¬ï¿½nition establishes a variate as a generalized form of a random variable. A consistent and unambiguous system of nomenclature can thus be developed, with chapter summaries relating to individual distributions. \n\n     Students, teachers, and practitioners for whom statistics is either a primary or secondary discipline will Ã¯Â¬ï¿½nd this book of great value, both for factual references and as a guide to the basic principles of the subject. It fulÃ¯Â¬ï¿½lls the need for rapid access to information that must otherwise be gleaned from many scattered sources.\n\n\n-_-\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f42d1e1a517a1547bd45a353f3bb8468155c904","amp;dn":"Statistical+Distributions+4e.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f42d1e1a517a1547bd45a353f3bb8468155c904","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,66,209,225,165,23,161,84,123,212,90,53,63,59,184,70,129,85,201,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
