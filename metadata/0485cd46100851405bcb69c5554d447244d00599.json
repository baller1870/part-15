House, Turner, Lemmy and Moorcock are the main ones that spring to mind. Also Doug Smith.\n\nAnyone hoping to hear/see Dave Brock&amp;#039;s input, forget it, as he didn&amp;#039;t take part in the making of this documentary. But it covers their history pretty well ... or as well as you CAN cover 38 years in 50 minutes!!\n\nNOTE: the VIDEO_TS folder plays fine on a computer but I haven&amp;#039;t tried burning it off to DVD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0485cd46100851405bcb69c5554d447244d00599","amp;dn":"Hawkwind+-+BBC4+documentary+%5C%27Do+not+Panic%5C%27+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0485cd46100851405bcb69c5554d447244d00599","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,133,205,70,16,8,81,64,91,203,105,197,85,77,68,114,68,208,5,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
