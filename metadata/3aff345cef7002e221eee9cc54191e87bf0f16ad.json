The Dante of DmC is a young man  who                \n                  has no respect for authority or indeed  society  in                \n                  general. Dante knows that  he  is  not  human,  but                \n                  also that he is  not  like  the  demons  that  have                \n                  tormented him throughout his life.  Caught  between                \n                  worlds, he feels like an  outcast.  Thanks  to  his                \n                  twin    brother    Vergil,    leader     of     the                \n                  anti-establishment group called &quot;The Order&quot;,  Dante                \n                  is now discovering and coming to  terms  with  what                \n                  it means to be the child of a demon and  an  angel.                \n                  This  split  personality  has  a  real  impact   on                \n                  gameplay with Dante being able to call  upon  angel                \n                  and  demon  abilities  at  will,  transforming  his                \n                  Rebellion sword on the fly to  dramatically  affect                \n                  both combat and movement.
