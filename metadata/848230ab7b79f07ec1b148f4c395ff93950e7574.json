But, upon learnng that Cecilia is also seeing a much younger man, Martin's desire becomes tainted with jealousy and eventually becomes an uncontrollable obsession that threatens to consume him.\n\nL'ENNUI is adapted from the novel 'La Noia' by Alberto Moravia (published in the UK by Secker and Warburg under the title of 'The Empty Canvas'). \n\n\nLanguage: French\nSubtitles: English \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0168740&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0168740&lt;/a&gt;\n\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 56mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 673 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 56mn\n      Bit rate : 1 442 Kbps\n      Width : 720 pixels\n      Height : 384 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.875\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.209\n      Stream size : 1.18 GiB (86%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 56mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 224 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 187 MiB (13%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 96 ms (2.40 video frames)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 96 ms\n\n\n  Upped KG: Costas    ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:848230ab7b79f07ec1b148f4c395ff93950e7574","amp;dn":"L%27ennui+%28C%26eacute%3Bdric+Kahn%2C+1998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"848230ab7b79f07ec1b148f4c395ff93950e7574","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,130,48,171,123,121,240,126,193,177,72,244,195,149,255,147,149,14,117,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
