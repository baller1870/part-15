Now they've bought a property in Dun Laoghaire south county Dublin but it's as far from being a home, or even a house, as you could imagine. Andrew and Avril's dream home is a 2 storey disused commercial lockup on a side street, hemmed in by public pavement on one side and double yellow lines on the other. It's dark, dusty and - for now - completely uninhabitable.\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 25-Jan-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50907dd61efdab01befe8a7720d965db895f6713","amp;dn":"Room.to.Improve.S08E01.HDTV.x264-SI.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50907dd61efdab01befe8a7720d965db895f6713","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,144,125,214,30,253,171,1,190,254,138,119,32,217,101,219,137,95,103,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
