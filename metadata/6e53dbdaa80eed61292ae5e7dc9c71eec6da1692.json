Four work at a salon: Nisrine, engaged to Bassam, with a secret she shares with her co-workers; Jamale, a divorced mother of teens, a part-time model, fearing the encroachment of time; Rima, always in pants, attracted to Siham, a client who smiles back; Layale, in love with a married man, willing to drop everything at a honk of his horn. There's also Rose, a middle-aged seamstress, who cares for Lili, old and facing dementia. Rose has a suitor; Layale has an admirer on the police force. Is delight a possibility? Is caramel a sweet or an instrument of pain?\n\nLanguages: Arabic / French","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e53dbdaa80eed61292ae5e7dc9c71eec6da1692","amp;dn":"Sukkar+Banat+aka+Caramel+2007+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e53dbdaa80eed61292ae5e7dc9c71eec6da1692","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,83,219,218,168,14,237,97,41,42,229,231,220,156,113,238,198,218,22,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
