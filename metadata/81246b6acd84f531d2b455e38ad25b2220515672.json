Dr. Cal Lightman and his team are effectively human polygraph machines, and no truth can be concealed from them. The Lightman Group is headed by Dr. Cal Lightman and his partner Dr. Gillian Foster who is a gifted psychologist. She brings balance to the partnership by thinking about the overall picture while Lightman focuses on the details. Together they make an invincible team with insight into human behavior. Eli Loker is the lead researcher, who believes in radical honesty. He often gets in trouble for saying what he thinks. Ria Torres is one of the few &quot;naturals&quot; in the field of deception detection. She has an untapped ability to read people that makes her a force to be reckoned with the right training.\n\nCreated by Sam Baum, Lie to Me is executive-produced by Baum, Brian Grazer, David Nevins and Steve Maeda. The series is produced by Imagine Television and 20th Century Fox Television\n\n\n\nCast\n\n\nTim Roth\t... \tDr. Cal Lightman\n\nKelli Williams\t... \tDr. Gillian Foster\n\nBrendan Hines\t... \tEli Loker\n\nMonica Raymund\t... \tRia Torres\n\n\nDirectory\n\nLie To Me - 1x01 - Pilot.avi\nLie To Me - 1x01 - Pilot.srt\nLie To Me - 1x02 - Moral Waiver.avi\nLie To Me - 1x02 - Moral Waiver.srt\nLie To Me - 1x03 - A Perfect Score.avi\nLie To Me - 1x03 - A Perfect Score.srt\nLie To Me - 1x04 - Love Always.avi\nLie To Me - 1x04 - Love Always.srt\nLie To Me - 1x05 - Unchained.avi\nLie To Me - 1x05 - Unchained.srt\nLie To Me - 1x06 - Do Not Harm.avi\nLie To Me - 1x06 - Do Not Harm.srt\nLie To Me - 1x07 - The Best Policy.avi\nLie To Me - 1x07 - The Best Policy.srt\nLie To Me - 1x08 - Depraved Heart.avi\nLie To Me - 1x08 - Depraved Heart.srt\nLie to Me - 1x09 - Life is Priceless.avi\nLie to Me - 1x09 - Life is Priceless.srt\nLie To Me - 1x10 - Better Half.avi\nLie To Me - 1x10 - Better Half.srt\nLie To Me - 1x11 - Undercover.avi\nLie To Me - 1x11 - Undercover.srt\nLie to Me - 1x12 - Blinded.avi\nLie to Me - 1x12 - Blinded.srt\nLie To Me - 1x13 - Sacrifice.avi\nLie To Me - 1x13 - Sacrifice.srt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81246b6acd84f531d2b455e38ad25b2220515672","amp;dn":"%5B2009%5D+Lie+to+me+Season+1+%2B+English+Subtitles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81246b6acd84f531d2b455e38ad25b2220515672","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,36,107,106,205,132,245,49,210,180,85,227,138,210,91,34,32,81,86,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
