Accompanied by a legendary line-up including Sweets Edison, Ben Webster and Barney Kessel, Holiday sang with the clear enunciation and easy swing that had become her trademark. \n\nWrapping her phrasing around standards by Rodgers &amp; Hart, The Gershwins and Cole Porter, Billie Holiday demonstrated how years of singing with various jazz bands sharpened her ability to turn a song on its head through slight fluctuations in pitch and tone color.\n\nAll tracks have been digitally remastered.\n\n\n01 Day In, Day Out (Herndon, Mercer, Bloom) 6:47\n02 A Foggy Day (G. &amp; I.
