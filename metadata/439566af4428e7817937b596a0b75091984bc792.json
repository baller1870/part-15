In 1959, Dramaten had produced some of MishimaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Noh plays and in 1970, the Swedish Theatre in Helsinki visited Dramaten with a version of Madame the Sade. Mishima had been nominated several times to the Novel Prize in literature but was passed over in favour of his mentor Kawabata (1968).\n\nThe setting of Madame de Sade begins in France in 1772 and ends twelve years later, nine months after the French Revolution. Six Women, one of them Madame de Sade, discuss their views and feelings of the notorious sadist and sodomist Marquis de Sade.\n\nAn enthusiastic critical corps focussed on BergmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ensemble of actresses and on the concentration and musicality of his staging.\n\nSource: TV Rip\nVÃƒÂ­deo Codec: XviD\nVÃƒÂ­deo Bitrate: 772.305 Kbps\nÃƒï¿½udio Codec: MPEG1/2 L3\nÃƒï¿½udio Bitrate: 56 kbps 24 KHz\nAspect Ratio: 1.333 (512 x 384)\n\nSUBS: English and Portuguese\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104819/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104819/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:439566af4428e7817937b596a0b75091984bc792","amp;dn":"Ingmar+Bergman+-+Markisinnan+de+Sade+%28TV%2C+1992%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"439566af4428e7817937b596a0b75091984bc792","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,149,102,175,68,40,231,129,121,55,181,150,160,183,80,145,152,75,199,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
