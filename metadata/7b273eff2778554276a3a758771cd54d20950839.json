Friday Music is joining Rhino Entertainment in keeping JonesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ rich legacy of music alive, with two new releases slated for April 24. After having recently reissued JonesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ pre-Monkees debut, the label turns its attention to JonesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ 1971-1972 recordings for the Bell Records label, featuring the hit Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rainy JaneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as well as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Girl,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the song immortalized on The Brady Bunch. But thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not all. On the same day as DavyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Bell Recordings 1971-1972, Friday will reissue The MonkeesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ 1987 reunion album Pool It! in an expanded edition boasting two bonus tracks and a DVD.\n\nThe first twelve tracks on The Bell Recordings represent the complete 1971 Davy Jones album, on which Neil Sedaka and Howard GreenfieldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rainy Jane,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a No. 52 hit for the singer. (SedakaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own 1969 version achieved some measure of popularity in Australia in the period between his early RCA hits and Rocket Records comeback.) The Bell era is also notable for JonesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ appearance on the Brady Bunch episode Ã¢â‚¬Å“Getting Davy Jones,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but Jones also kept a high profile via television guest spots on Love American Style, Here Come the Brides and even The New Scooby-Doo Movies! Davy Jones was arranged and conducted by Al Capps, who also worked with Bobby Sherman, Andy Williams and Cher, and carried on the lighter sound of the MonkeesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ repertoire rather than that bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s later sonic explorations. The twelve tracks from Davy Jones are augmented by six bonus tracks: the mono singles Ã¢â‚¬Å“GirlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ b/w Ã¢â‚¬Å“Take My LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Believe in YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ b/w Ã¢â‚¬Å“Road to Love,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ plus album tracks Ã¢â‚¬Å“How About MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Really Love You,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ also both in mono.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b273eff2778554276a3a758771cd54d20950839","amp;dn":"Davy+Jones...The+Bell+Recordings+%281971-72%29%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b273eff2778554276a3a758771cd54d20950839","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,39,62,255,39,120,85,66,118,163,167,88,119,28,213,77,32,149,8,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
