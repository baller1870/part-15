It's a struggle just to make ends meet and afford what they need right now. I think anyone can start to prepare for the future.\n\nMy husband and I have a 4-figure annual income that isn't even close to hitting five figures. If we can do it, you can too. We're not just telling you how to do it, we're living it!\n\nDon't be put off by books, websites, and forums that lead you to think you have to buy expensive pre-packaged food storage, or foods that you're not familiar with. Stocking up doesn't have to be expensive or complicated. You can get started with just a few dollars a month.\n\nIf, at the end of the book,you still don't think you can do it, send me an email and we'll talk. I've included my email address, my blog link, and we're working on a website.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9e15f10db690765344e7bd06c6cd9000c37264f","amp;dn":"Poverty+Prepping+-+How+to+Stock+up+For+Tomorrow+When+You+Can%27t+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9e15f10db690765344e7bd06c6cd9000c37264f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,225,95,16,219,105,7,101,52,78,123,208,108,108,217,0,12,55,38,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
