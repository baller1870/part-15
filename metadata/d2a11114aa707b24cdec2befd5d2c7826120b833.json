Het volgt\nIchabod Crane als partner van Sleepy Hollows vrouwelijke sheriff\nin de strijd om mysteries op te lossen tussen het goed en kwaad.\n\n\n\nEnglish\n\nScene begins in the middle of some kind of battle. Looks like revolutionary war times. Red coats vs. blue coats. A blue coat shoots his gun at the red coats hiding behind a tree. He comes out and feels the pulse of a fallen comrade. Another soldier suddenly yells, &quot;CRANE!!&quot; while pointing to something behind him.\n\nA red coat soldier riding a pale white horse jumps over a small barrier. He looks pretty menacing and his face is completely covered with some kind of clothe. Crane shoots him on this shoulder with his gun and the red coat falls off his horse. Instead of staying down, he simply rises back up like he is not even hurt. Crane has a 'WTF' look on his face. The red coat takes out this huge halberd and takes a swipe at Crane. The camera zooms in on the tatoo or some kind burn mark on the red coat's hand. Looks like a bow of some type. The red coat swings his halberd and slices open Crane's chest. As Crane is about to fall, he swings his sword cutting the red coat's head off. Crane falls down as does the headless horseman.. Everything fades to black.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2647544/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2647544/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nBron: WEB-DL\nContainer: x264 MKV\nAudio: DD5.1\nSubs: Custom NL (Instelbaar)\nQuality over Quantity (QoQ) Releases Vertalingen.\nVertaling: Skip77\nControle: WinchesterGirl\n\n\n\nBenieuwd naar ons?
