With MIDI tracks, the speed of the music can be adjusted so kids can learn at their own pace. When My Piano is used with a MIDI keyboard, kids get instant feedback on notes and rhythms they played wrong and find out what they should have played instead. Additional features such as a metronome and digital recorder are also included. My Piano is the perfect way to introduce children to playing piano!\n\nGreat software for children or total beginner piano player.\n\nThis is my first torrent, please leave a comment if the software does not work.\n\nAll you need to do is to install it, it does not require the key code.\n\nMy computer is not on all day, please seed if you uploaded the whole torrent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7899af9d3f575b5495a62c9c7391a6a6c0ae4c8","amp;dn":"eMedia+My+Piano+-++play+piano+software","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7899af9d3f575b5495a62c9c7391a6a6c0ae4c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,137,154,249,211,245,117,181,73,90,98,201,199,57,26,106,108,10,228,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
