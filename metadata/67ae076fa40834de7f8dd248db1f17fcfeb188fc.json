They originally formed in San Francisco, California in 1980 before relocating to Aberdeen, Washington the following year and briefly using the name Shrapnel. Their eponymous debut album was released in 1984, and their latest, XI, is due for release in 2016.\r\n\r\nThe band is credited as a formative influence on the thrash metal subgenre, melding the aesthetics of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal and American hard rock with &quot;incredibly tight musicianship&quot; and &quot;piercingly screeched&quot; vocals. Early lyrical topics such as conflict and paranoia later expanded into philosophical and social commentary.\r\n\r\nFounding guitarist Kurdt Vanderhoof remained the group's sole consistent creative force throughout its career, despite reducing his role strictly to composition in 1986 after tiring of performing. Vanderhoof, vocalist David Wayne, guitarist Craig Wells, bassist Duke Erickson, and drummer Kirk Arrington composed the group's classic lineup featured on its first two records, while vocalist Mike Howe and guitarist John Marshall later contributed to the group's sound. After releasing five full-length albums and touring extensively throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Metal Church disbanded in 1994. \r\n\r\nThey reformed four years later with their classic lineup, including Vanderhoof's return to performance, yielding the Masterpeace album. They endured numerous lineup changes thereafter, releasing three further studio albums while fronted by Ronny Munroe before again disbanding in July 2009. The group once again reunited in October 2012 and released Generation Nothing a year later. Following Munroe's departure in the fall of 2014, Howe rejoined Metal Church in April 2015 at Vanderhoof's request, and recorded their upcoming eleventh studio album XI.\r\n\r\nContents\r\n\r\nYear:\t1998\r\nStyle:\tThrash Metal\r\nCountry:\tUSA\r\nFormat:\t320 mp3\r\nSize:\t140.82 MB\r\n\r\n\t\r\nAdded:\t09/03/2016\r\nFiles:\t12\r\n\r\nDescription:\t\r\nLength : 01:01:30 \r\n\r\nTracks :\r\n\r\n01 Intro-No Friend Of Mine\r\n02 Start The Fire\r\n03 Fake Healer\r\n04 In Mourning\r\n05 Little Boy\r\n06 Losers In The Game\r\n07 Watch The Children Pray\r\n08 Hypnotized\r\n09 Gods Of Second Chance\r\n10 Waiting For A Savior\r\n11 Badlands\r\n\r\nMembers\r\n\r\nCurrent members\r\n\r\n Kurdt Vanderhoof â€“ guitar (1980â€“1986, 1998â€“2009, 2012â€“present); co-composition (1986â€“1994)\r\n Mike Howe â€“ lead vocals (1988â€“1994, 2015â€“present)\r\n Steve Unger â€“ bass (2004â€“2009, 2012â€“present)\r\n Jeff Plate â€“ drums (2006â€“2009, 2012â€“present)\r\n Rick Van Zandt â€“ guitar (2008â€“2009, 2013â€“present)\r\n[image=FwnKuGTUZX]\r\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/24/356/FwnKuGTUZX.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67ae076fa40834de7f8dd248db1f17fcfeb188fc","amp;dn":"Metal+Church+-+Live+In+Japan+1998+320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67ae076fa40834de7f8dd248db1f17fcfeb188fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,174,7,111,164,8,52,222,127,141,210,72,219,31,23,252,254,177,136,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
