Although the album, like the movie, gets the time period slightly wrong ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ new wave was finished by 1985, but the entire project barrels ahead as if it were the glory days of 1983 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the end result is thoroughly enjoyable. There are only two remakes and two Adam Sandler showcases on the 14-track album, leaving ten tracks of great new wave and post-punk from Culture Club (&quot;Do You Really Want to Hurt Me&quot;), the Police (&quot;Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic&quot;), the Psychedelic Furs (&quot;Love My Way&quot;), Elvis Costello (&quot;Everyday I Write the Book&quot;), the Thompson Twins (&quot;Hold Me Now&quot;), David Bowie (&quot;China Girl&quot;), New Order (&quot;Blue Monday&quot;), Musical Youth (&quot;Pass the Dutchie&quot;), the Smiths (&quot;How Soon Is Now?&quot;), and Billy Idol (&quot;White Wedding&quot;), who also appears in the film. The Presidents of the United States of America do a surprisingly good job with the Buggles&amp;#039; &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; (the track turned out to be the last thing the group recorded), and the Sandler&amp;#039;s tracks are better and funnier than his comedy records, but Ellen Dow&amp;#039;s rappin&amp;#039; granny on &quot;Rapper&amp;#039;s Delight&quot; is either the funniest thing you&amp;#039;ve ever heard or annoys the hell out of you. Even if the latter case holds true for you, it&amp;#039;s not enough to ruin one of the most entertaining pop soundtracks in a while.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01 - Video Killed the Radio Star - The Presidents of the United States of America [3:21]\n02 - Do You Really Want to Hurt Me - Culture Club [4:19]\n03 - Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic - The Police [4:18]\n04 - How Soon Is Now? - The Smiths [6:41]\n05 - Love My Way - The Psychedelic Furs [3:30]\n06 - Hold Me Now - Thompson Twins [4:43]\n07 - Everyday I Write the Book - Elvis Costello [3:51]\n08 - White Wedding - Billy Idol [4:09]\n09 - China Girl - David Bowie [5:28]\n10 - Blue Monday - New Order [7:25]\n11 - Pass the Dutchie - Musical Youth [3:23]\n12 - Have You Written Anything Lately?
