So I figured why not share it.\n\nIt's a fantastic four-song set with Lacey on raw vocals and Sameer on an acoustic guitar. That's it. Very stripped back, very nice to listen to if you dig that kind of thing, which I do.\n\nThe songs are 192kb .m4a files, ready to play in your favorite player, importable to iTunes, and feature embedded cover art with full proper ID tags.\n\nTrack List:\n\n* Fully Alive (2:33)\n* Cassie (2:59)\n* I'm So Sick (3:02)\n* Sorrow (2:53)\n\n\nIF YOU ENJOY THIS SMALL SET, PLEASE SUPPORT THE ARTIST.\n\nI've played their song on Rock Band, but it wasn't until after listening to these songs, I went ahead and put the order in on Amazon to support the band: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W7Y1M4 -- Hooray 2-day free shipping with Prime!\n\n\n*** PLEASE SEED ***\n\nPlease seed to at least a 1.01 ratio (101%) - Keep the small torrents going!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a413b6ea22f90281d625e6fdf790bb01f5146d21","amp;dn":"Flyleaf+-+Rolling+Stone+Originals+%282006+live+acoustic+set%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a413b6ea22f90281d625e6fdf790bb01f5146d21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,19,182,234,34,249,2,129,214,37,230,253,247,144,187,1,245,20,109,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
