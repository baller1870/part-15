RAD Studio includes DelphiÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, C++BuilderÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, \n\nEmbarcadero PrismÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ and RadPHPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢, enabling developers to deliver applications up to 5x faster across multiple desktop, mobile, Web, and database platforms including Delphi applications for 64-bit Windows.\n\nWhat's new:\nDelphi and C++Builder have traditionally been used by Windows developers to create applications for MicrosoftÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s platform, but now they target Mac OS X as well. The IDEs do no run on Mac, but they have compilers generating binaries that \n\ncan be installed and run over the network on a Mac computer, resulting in two application binaries from a single set of source files. Delphi includes support for Windows 64-bit machines, including a debugger and deployment manager.\n\nDelphi and C++Builder also include FireMonkey, a new platform for creating HD and 3D animations for Windows, Mac OS X and iOS. These native applications make use of the CPU and GPU to draw the animations and can be connected to any data \n\ntype through LiveBindings.\n\nDelphi and C++ applications can be deployed to Amazon EC2 and Windows Azure, with support for Amazon Simple Storage Service API, Queue Service, and SimpleDB.\n\nHardware requirements:\n* Intel Pentium or compatible, 1.6GHz minimum (2GHz+ recommended)\n* 1GB RAM (2 GB+ recommended)\n* 3-9 GB (or more) of free disk space\n* 0.5-1.5 GB additional temporary free space for use by the installer\n* Mouse or other pointing device\n* DVD-ROM drive (if installing from a Media Kit DVD)\n* 1024x768 or higher resolution monitor\n* Color quality above 256 colors (32-bit or 16-bit is sufficient)\n\nWindows requirements:\n* MicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Windows 7 (32-bit and 64-bit)\n* Microsoft Windows VistaTM SP2 (32-bit and 64-bit) requires administrator rights\n* Microsoft Windows XP Home or Professional (32-bit and 64-bit) SP2 or SP3\n* Microsoft Windows Server 2003 (SP1) or 2008 (32-bit and 64-bit)\n* The latest service packs and security updates are recommended for all platforms\n* Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1 or later\n\nIMPORTANT:\nThe keygen file can be caught as a suspection of a virus by some of the antivirus heuristics engines, but it is not.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb08e0c7c15021af57081df35bd5b6aa0290466e","amp;dn":"Embarcadero+RAD+Studio+XE2+with+Update+1+%28incl.+keygen%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb08e0c7c15021af57081df35bd5b6aa0290466e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,8,224,199,193,80,33,175,87,8,29,243,91,213,182,170,2,144,70,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
