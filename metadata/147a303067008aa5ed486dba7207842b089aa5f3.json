It reached number one on the Billboard R&amp;B charts and peaked at number seven on the Pop Singles chart.\n\nAccording to the Allmusic review of the song, &quot;the lyric takes the cool image of the lowrider Ã¢â‚¬â€ the Chicano culture practice of hydraulically hot rodding classic cars  and using innuendo, extends the image to a lifestyle.&quot; Charles Miller was most responsible for the creating of the #1 hit, on which he also sang the lead part.\n\nThe music video for the song consists of various pimpmobiles on a typical suburban-style street, showing two men each driving a pimpmobile. At one point, an animated version of the face of the album Why Can't We Be Friends? is lip-synching, &quot;Low Rider knows every street, yeah&quot; with its gold tooth shining, as well as a man wearing a mask of the album's face. There are also scenes consisting of a driver showing off the album holding it out the window or on the windshield.\n\nWhy Can't We Be Friends? was released in 1975. It included &quot;Low Rider&quot;, and the title track, which were among the band's biggest hits.\n\n\nWar (originally called Eric Burdon and War) is an American funk band from California, known for the hit songs &quot;Low Rider&quot;, &quot;Spill the Wine&quot;, &quot;Summer&quot;, &quot;Why Can't We Be Friends?&quot;, &quot;The Cisco Kid&quot;, and &quot;The World Is a Ghetto&quot;. Formed in 1969, War was a musical crossover band which fused elements of rock, funk, jazz, Latin, rhythm and blues, and reggae. The band also transcended racial and cultural barriers with a multi-ethnic line-up. War was also subject to many line-up changes over the course of its formation, leaving member Leroy &quot;Lonnie&quot; Jordan as the only original member in the current line-up.\n\nAlthough War's lyrics are often socio-political in nature, their music usually had a laid-back, California funk vibe. A particular feature of War's sound is the use of harmonica and saxophone playing melody lines in unison, sounding like a single instrument, for example in the melody of &quot;Low Rider&quot;. The music has been sampled and recorded by many singers and groups, ranging from R&amp;B/pop singers such as Janet Jackson to nu metal band Korn and hip hop groups like TLC and A$AP Mob.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Rider&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Rider&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/PAoEJaafn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/PAoEJaafn&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 7800kbps\n   Audio: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD, 16 bit]\n   Duration: 00:03:09\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
