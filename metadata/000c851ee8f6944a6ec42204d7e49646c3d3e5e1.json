With this hands-on guide, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll quickly master NodeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s core fundamentals, gain experience with several built-in and contributed modules, and learn the differences and parallels between client- and server-side programming.\n\nGet up to speed on NodeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s event-driven, asynchronous I/O model for developing data-intensive applications that are frequently accessed but computationally simple. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re comfortable working with JavaScript, this book provides numerous programming and deployment examples to help you take advantage of server-side development with Node.\n\n- Explore NodeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique approach to asynchronous development\n- Build sample Node applications with the Express framework and Connect middleware\n- Use NoSQL solutions such as Redis and MongoDBÃ¢â‚¬â€and explore NodeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relational database modules\n- Work with PDF files, serve HTML5 media, and create graphics with Canvas\n- Set up bidirectional communication between browser and server with WebSockets\n- Learn in-depth practices for debugging and testing your applications\n- Deploy Node applications in the cloud or on your own system\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Learning Node will make it easy for someone from any programming background to get a grip on Node.js and build amazing projects.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Tom Hughes-Croucher, co-author of Node: Up and Running (OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly)\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
