Michael Straczynski. A first season consisting of \n12 episodes has been produced and became available for streaming on Netflix on \nJune 5, 2015. The Wachowskis are responsible for the direction of the biggest part \nof the show, with the rest of it being handled by a number of people they have \ncollaborated with in the past, including Cloud Atlas co-director Tom Tykwer. Meanwhile \nthis is the first series produced under the banner of Straczynski's Studio JMS. \nThe plot revolves around eight strangers from different parts of the world who suddenly \nbecome mentally and emotionally linked and it is set to explore subjects that its \nwriters felt science fiction shows tend to ignore or skim through such as politics, \nidentity, sexuality, gender and religion\n\n\nPLEASE SEED  -  PLEASE SHARE  -  PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ee75107436d444a41994f00991a9a7fe98ad6e3","amp;dn":"Sense8+-+Complete+Season+1+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ee75107436d444a41994f00991a9a7fe98ad6e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,231,81,7,67,109,68,74,65,153,79,0,153,26,154,127,233,138,214,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
