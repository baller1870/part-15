It is a straightforward concept, much like many of the hard rock videos of the time. It shows the band performing the song at a mock concert. It was nominated for three MTV Video Music Awards, and won &quot;best stage performance&quot; for the video.\n\nThe version of the song used for the video differs slightly from the album version. During the keyboard solo prior to the final refrain, David Lee Roth is heard (and seen) yelling out. He did this during the band's mock performance for the video's filming, and it is believed that afterwards he overdubbed this yell especially for the video version since it is not present in the song to begin with.\n\n\n\nFile Name:\n01 Jump - Van Halen\n\nFile Format:\nmp4\n\nDuration:\n00:04:02\n\nBit Rate:\n1729k\n\nFile Size:\n49.99 MB\n\nVideo Codec:\nh264\n\nVideo Bitrate:\n1599k\n\nVideo Size:\n720x528\n\nAspect Ratio:\n1.36:1\n\nFrame Rate:\n29.97fps\n\nAudio Codec:\nmp3\n\nAudio Bitrate:\n128k\n\nChannels:\n2\n\nSample Rate:\n48000","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:863dec7d15138ba63163855c0f4d8c2634a5c585","amp;dn":"Van+Halen+-+Jump","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"863dec7d15138ba63163855c0f4d8c2634a5c585","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,61,236,125,21,19,139,166,49,99,133,92,15,77,140,38,52,165,197,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
