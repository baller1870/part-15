It has been instrumental to the mission of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as well as other federal agencies in evaluating public health concerns, informing regulatory and technological decisions, prioritizing research needs and funding, and in developing approaches for cost-benefit analysis. However, risk assessment is at a crossroads. Despite advances in the field, risk assessment faces a number of significant challenges including lengthy delays in making complex decisions; lack of data leading to significant uncertainty in risk assessments; and many chemicals in the marketplace that have not been evaluated and emerging agents requiring assessment. Science and Decisions makes practical scientific and technical recommendations to address these challenges. This book is a complement to the widely used 1983 National Academies book, Risk Assessment in the Federal Government (also known as the Red Book). The earlier book established a framework for the concepts and conduct of risk assessment that has been adopted by numerous expert committees, regulatory agencies, and public health institutions. The new book embeds these concepts within a broader framework for risk-based decision-making. Together, these are essential references for those working in the regulatory and public health fields.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPaperback: 424 pages\nPublisher: National Academies Press; 1 edition (February 25, 2009)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0309120462\nISBN-13: 978-0309120463\nAmazon Link:\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f5fbb51efc8ebbd2011772079c92bf4f9e919cd","amp;dn":"Science+and+Decisions%3A+Advancing+Risk+Assessment+%282009%29+%7B%3DIMPAVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f5fbb51efc8ebbd2011772079c92bf4f9e919cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,95,187,81,239,200,235,189,32,17,119,32,121,201,43,244,249,233,25,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
