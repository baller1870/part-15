True, her son became Catholic when he married - not a Jewish mother's dream. But Sheila is sure that any day now her daughter will announce her engagement to a wonderful Jewish boy. When the announcement comes though, there's one small change to Sheila's script. Jenny's intended is a wonderful Jewish girl. \n\nWith assistance from a support group, Sheila rises to the occasion and helps Jenny plan a blowout lesbian wedding. Even as she calls caterers, Sheila is keeping the affair secret from her disapproving spouse. But another secret disturbs her far more: She has become infatuated with a striking lesbian artist. Now Sheila is dreaming of an affair of her own, one that could alter her life forever.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e182bb8322b189da682c1709b06857a0ccbdf4ff","amp;dn":"FF+Rochelle+Hollander+Schwab+-+In+a+family+way","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e182bb8322b189da682c1709b06857a0ccbdf4ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,130,187,131,34,177,137,218,104,44,23,9,176,104,87,160,204,189,244,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
