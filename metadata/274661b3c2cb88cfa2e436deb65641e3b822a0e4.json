is the title of a number of \naudio-veritÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© recordings of two violent alcoholics, \nRaymond Huffman and Peter Haskett.\n\nThe recordings were made by &quot;Eddie Lee Sausage&quot; and &quot;Mitchell D.&quot;, \nwho lived in a bright pink apartment buildingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½dubbed \nthe &quot;Pepto Bismol Palace&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in San Francisco&amp;#039;s Lower Haight district.\n\nEddie Lee and Mitchell moved into the apartment in 1987, \nand soon discovered their neighbors, Peter and Ray, who argued\n nearly constantly. \nThere was also a third who is on tape, \nPeter&amp;#039;s gay lover, ex army man, vagrant Tony.\n\nThey were initially shocked and intimidated by the \nvolume and intensity of the fights, which occasionally turned violent. \nLater, however, Eddie Lee and Mitchell became fascinated \nby the content of Ray and Peter&amp;#039;s yelling matches. \nPeter&amp;#039;s repeated insult of &quot;Shut Up, Little Man!&quot; \nbecame a fixture of Eddie Lee and Mitchell&amp;#039;s own conversations.\n\nEventually, Eddie and Mitchell began tape recording the arguments, \nand distributing copies among their friends.\n\nEddie Lee and Mitchell sometimes goaded Ray and Peter, \nsuch as with prank telephone calls, hoping to introduce \nnew topics for the drunken pair to argue over.\n\nIn 1992, after Eddie had moved to Madison, Wisconsin \nto obtain a Masters Degree, he received a telephone call from \nSan Francisco&amp;#039;s Bananafish magazine. \nCopies of Peter and Raymond&amp;#039;s tapes had found their way\n to the magazine&amp;#039;s editor, who was interested in arranging \na commercial release of Ray and Peter&amp;#039;s screaming matches.\n\nThe first Shut Up, Little Man! compact disc was released \nin early 1993. \nA number of other volumes were issued later. \nThe recordings quickly gained a cult following, \nand were adapted into comic books, zines, a theatrical production \nand the 2002 independent film Shut Yer Dirty Little Mouth, \nstarring Gill Gayle and Glenn Shadix as Ray and Peter, respectively.\n\nThe recordings found fame far beyond San Francisco. \nLee reports that &quot;I went to see (New York City-based) John Zorn, \none of my favorite jazz composers, performing with his \nexperimental game-playing ensemble, Cobra. \nThe keyboard player had sampled Shut Up Little Man, and thus, \nthroughout the evening -- amidst the saxophone squawks \nand grinding guitar breaks -- \nthere would be sampled little blasts of: \n  &amp;#039;Shut your fuckin&amp;#039; mouth!&amp;#039; or &amp;#039;I want to kill!&amp;#039;&quot;\n\nRaymond Huffman died in 1992 , he was repeatedly kicked \nby Tony while lying in bed, and soon died from the trauma. \nPeter died in 1996 of liver problems due to years of excessive drinking. \nTony was placed into a mental institution \nand his current whereabouts are unknown.\n\nThe band DEVO had a side project, &quot;The Wipeouters&quot; and \non their only album there is a track titled \n&quot;Shut Up, Little Man&quot; \nusing many samples of Ray and Peter.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://shutuplittleman.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://shutuplittleman.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCompiled by Big Brother\nFirst posted on www.thepiratebay.se\n\nTeam 1984 \nYour best source for:\n    Rare/Out of Print music\n    Audio/Video Bootlegs\n    Old/Out of Print Software\n    Counter-culture books/text\n    Off the beaten path movies\n    Weird Porn\n    Anything else that we dig..\n\nTeam 1984 doesn&amp;#039;t do mainstream\n          doesn&amp;#039;t follow the herd\n          are just some stoned hippies\n                     with attitude\n\nWant to be a member of Team 1984?\nSimple, \n    Just include this NFO\n             and\n    Don&amp;#039;t up anything lame/mainstream\n\nHails to:\n   freakyflicks, Fat Fuck Frank, sickboy88\n   splattergod, ChrisGoes, Bob Dylan\n\nFuck Off to:\n    RIAA, MPAA, Viacom, Metallica\n              ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:274661b3c2cb88cfa2e436deb65641e3b822a0e4","amp;dn":"Shut+Up+Little+Man+-+The+Bootleg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"274661b3c2cb88cfa2e436deb65641e3b822a0e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,70,97,179,194,203,136,207,162,228,54,222,182,86,65,227,184,34,160,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
