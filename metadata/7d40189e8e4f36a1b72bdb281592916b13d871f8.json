They return home to Sabbath unaware of his death. Bannock lawman Jered Maddox later arrives there to arrest everyone involved on a charge of murder. Sabbath is run by land baron Vince Bronson, a benevolent despot, who, upon hearing of the death, offers restitution for the incident. Maddox, however, will not compromise even though small ranchers like Vern Adams are not in a position to desert their responsibilities for a long and protracted trial. Sabbath's marshal, Cotton Ryan, is an aging lawman whose tough reputation rests on a single incident that occurred years before. Ryan admits to being only a shadow of what he once was and incapable of stopping Maddox.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d40189e8e4f36a1b72bdb281592916b13d871f8","amp;dn":"Lawman++%28Western+1971%29++Burt+Lancaster%2C+Robert+Ryan+%26amp%3B+Lee+J.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d40189e8e4f36a1b72bdb281592916b13d871f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,64,24,158,142,79,54,161,183,43,219,40,21,146,145,107,19,216,113,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
