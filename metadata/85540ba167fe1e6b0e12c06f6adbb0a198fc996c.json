But how? What are the tools to prevent our being deceived or misled?\n\nThe context of a passage is always a primary consideration in the search for understanding of a passage of Scripture. It is often cited, &quot;A verse out of context is a pretext.&quot; And, indeed, one must always maintain an awareness of both who is doing the speaking and the audience being addressed. However, this foundational emphasis can also be a restrictive blindfold to some of a passage's deeper (and broader) implications.\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85540ba167fe1e6b0e12c06f6adbb0a198fc996c","amp;dn":"Chuck+Missler+-+The+Whole+Counsel+of+God++%28DivX%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85540ba167fe1e6b0e12c06f6adbb0a198fc996c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,84,11,161,103,254,30,107,14,18,192,111,106,219,176,161,152,252,153,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
