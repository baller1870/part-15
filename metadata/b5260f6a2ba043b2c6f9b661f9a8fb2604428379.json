However, in this fantasy world where a complete purge of evil is achieved and darkness is almost unheard of, a druid discovers that this could be considered too much of a good thing. With the contrast of good and evil gone, the world has become unbalanced and dangerously unstable. In order to prevent reality from literally falling apart the druid must find a way to bring back the darkness, which the old heroes have locked away. To bring back the darkness the druid must gather a team of the few left alive willing to do so; a team of villains. Together these villains must step out of their comfort zone and work together to save the world from itself.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ - Wikipedia\n\nThemes &amp; Controversies:    ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe bulk of the themes in Villains by Necessity mostly are twists on typical fantasy stereotypes resulting mostly in a wide range of light hearted and dark humor, but a fair mixture of controversial views of the general ideas behind what is truly good and bad are introduced as well as the story moves forward. Often the characters are confronted by situations that point out the inconsistencies behind the traditional ideas of being strictly categorized as one or the other.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Wikipedia\n\n\nFor more interesting and hard to find eBooks look at my other uploads or send me a personal message and IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll try to accommodate any requests.\n\n\nAs always --- After you have confirmed this to be authentic please\n\n+ Comment + Seed + Enjoy\n\n-TwisTtheTwiTcH\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5260f6a2ba043b2c6f9b661f9a8fb2604428379","amp;dn":"Villains+by+Necessity+by+author+Eve+Forward+1995","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5260f6a2ba043b2c6f9b661f9a8fb2604428379","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,38,15,106,43,160,67,178,198,249,182,97,249,168,251,38,4,66,131,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
