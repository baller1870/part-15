Winters have\nalways been a very creative time for me, explains Allien. In\nparticular after the hot and crazy 2007 summer and autumn in\nBerlin.\n\nThe album bucks the trend of Berliners shrinking away from the\nword minimal, described as subtle, mysterious, and minimal\nin the press notes. Allien explains: What does minimal mean\nfor me? Minimal is just there. Shaping this kind of immediacy\nwith my own handsthat was close to my heart.\n\nSo what is a SOOL then? Bit of an odd title, isnt it? SOOL\nis a phantasm, a creation, which reflects the albums\natmosphere, and also my person. I am me but I am also what you\nmake of me, what you do with me and what I do with you. And,\nSOOL is curiosity, space and architecture. Sketches, drawing,\nadhering.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8c193acd28afc1afd4e6e506fe9fbb5ea80063a","amp;dn":"Ellen+Allien+-+2008+-+Sool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8c193acd28afc1afd4e6e506fe9fbb5ea80063a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,193,147,172,210,138,252,26,253,78,110,80,111,233,251,181,234,128,6,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
