Power mourners keep stampeding down the red carpets of the Kennedy Center, handing out business cards, touching base. And there is no time to waste in a gold rush, even (or especially) at a solemn tribal event like this.\n\nWashingtonÃ¢â‚¬â€This TownÃ¢â‚¬â€might be loathed from every corner of the nation, yet these are fun and busy days at this nexus of big politics, big money, big media, and big vanity. There are no Democrats and Republicans anymore in the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s capital, just millionaires. That is the grubby secret of the place in the twenty-first century. You will always have lunch in This Town again. No matter how many elections you lose, apologies you make, or scandals you endure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2403fa98e2561f4229ec25c5863e32904253379b","amp;dn":"This+Town%3A+Two+Parties+and+a+Funeral-Plus%2C+Plenty+of+Valet+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2403fa98e2561f4229ec25c5863e32904253379b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,3,250,152,226,86,31,66,41,236,37,197,134,62,50,144,66,83,55,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
