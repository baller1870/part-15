Dr. Fehmi shows us that it is possible to learn to resolve pain at the brain level, using simple attention exercises. Drawing on scientific research, Dr. Fehmi explains how to quiet the pain signal in the brain, empowering readers to free themselves from many forms of pain and discomfort. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4751ac2f958ac4c76f8c7adf11d668a8bd6579f7","amp;dn":"Dissolving+Pain+-+Les+Fehmi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4751ac2f958ac4c76f8c7adf11d668a8bd6579f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,81,172,47,149,138,196,199,111,140,122,223,17,214,104,168,189,101,121,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
