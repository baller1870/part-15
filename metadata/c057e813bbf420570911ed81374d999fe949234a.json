After a confrontation and tear-filled dinner, Vicki and Tamra attempt to repair their lost friendship. Terry's need to constantly make jokes rubs Heather the wrong way, while Alexis and Jim's ballroom dancing lesson rub them the right way. Gretchen visits Slade at the radio station to support his new endeavors, and Tamra gets more than she bargained for when Eddie expresses his concerns about Vicki.\n\n\nThanks to RKSTR for capping and sharing.\n\nEnjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c057e813bbf420570911ed81374d999fe949234a","amp;dn":"The.Real.Housewives.Of.Orange.County.S08E02.HDTV.x264-RKSTR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c057e813bbf420570911ed81374d999fe949234a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,87,232,19,187,244,32,87,9,17,237,129,55,77,153,159,233,73,35,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
