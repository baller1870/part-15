A crack in the sidewalk? The trunk of a fallen tree? Shards of broken pottery? Do you want your artwork to speak to the abstract nature of color, and shape and texture, composition and mood?\n\nWith Wabi-Sabi Art Workshop, you'll learn to use your appreciation for the simple things in life--the ordinary, the aged, the humble--as your inspiration for making expressive, intuitive art. You will come to embrace imperfection and recognize that, yes, in fact, there is such a thing as a happy accident","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:736fb0b8104f4ab22e186c11aa43e1696c421a0d","amp;dn":"Wabi-Sabi+Art+Workshop%3A+Mixed+Media+Techniques","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"736fb0b8104f4ab22e186c11aa43e1696c421a0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,111,176,184,16,79,74,178,46,24,108,17,170,67,225,105,108,66,26,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
