The material performed for this CD reissue is just not all that inspiring -- a few overly played standards and blues.  Despite some good efforts by Gillespie and Eldridge, pianist Oscar Peterson easily emerges as the most impressive soloist; better to acquire the magnificent collaborations of the 1950s instead. ~ Scott Yanow, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nRoy Eldridge (Trumpet) \nDizzy Gillespie (Trumpet) \nOscar Peterson (Piano) \nRay Brown (Double Bass) \nMickey Roker (Drums)\n\nDizzy Gillespie, Roy Eldridge &amp; Oscar Peterson - Jazz Maturity Tracks:\n01  Quasi-Boogaloo (Roy Eldridge/Dizziy Gillespie/Oscar Peterson) 9:03 \n02  Take the A Train (Billy Strayhorn) 8:08 \n03  I Cried for You (Now it's Your Turn to Cry Over Me) (Gus Arnheim/Arthur Freed/Abe Lyman) 7:56 \n04  Drebirks (Roy Eldridge/Dizziy Gillespie/Oscar Peterson) 11:21 \n05  When It's Happy Time Down South (Clarence Muse/Leon RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©/Otis Rene) 6:20 \n06  Indiana (James F.
