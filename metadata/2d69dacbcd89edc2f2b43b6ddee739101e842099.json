The book also has prelude and interlude where a classical physicist and a quantum physicist (the author) argue about many interesting physical and philosophical matters pertaining to physics.\n\n    The aim of this book is to acquaint the reader with the concepts and ideas of quantum mechanics and the physical properties of matter; to reveal the logic of its new ideas, to show how these ideas are  embodied in the mathematical apparatus of linear operators and to demonstrate the working of this apparatus using a number of examples and problems of interest to engineering students.\n\nBook was translated from the Russian by Ram S. Wadhwa and was first published by Mir in 1980.\n\nReleased on TPB by mirtitles.org\n\nPDF | OCR | Cover | Bookmarked | Paginated | 272 Pages | 21.7 MB \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d69dacbcd89edc2f2b43b6ddee739101e842099","amp;dn":"Tarasov-Basic-Concepts-of-Quantum-Mechanics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d69dacbcd89edc2f2b43b6ddee739101e842099","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,105,218,203,205,137,237,194,242,180,59,109,222,231,57,16,30,132,32,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
