The story unfolds in the 11th century, when Milarepa (Jamyang Lodro) - christened Thopaga - unexpectedly loses his father, and finds his life plunged into a bleak hell. His vile aunt and uncle, Peydon and Gyalsten (played by Tsamchoe and Gonpo, respectively) seize control of the deceased's inheritance and force Thopaga, his mother Kargyen (Kelsang Chukie Tethtong), and his sister Peta (Tashi Lhamo) into a period of seemingly limitless domestic slavery. When Thopaga turns 16, Kargyen seizes the opportunity to throw an engagement party for him, hoping that she can use the circumstances to reclaim property and title. The townspeople fail to come to her aid, however, causing Kargyen to spur Thopaga onward toward an apprenticeship in the dark arts and an onslaught of ugly, black magic-fueled revenge. In the end, her plan backfires - thus demonstrating the nasty consequences for anyone who seeks unbridled vengeance against evildoers.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Milarepa (2006).avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.17 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 31mn\n      Bit rate : 1828 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 5.84 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n      IAS1 : Tibetan\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Custom\n      PlayTime : 1h 31mn\n      Bit rate : 1376 Kbps\n      Width : 720 pixels\n      Height : 400 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 16/9\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.198\n      StreamSize : 902 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 1h 31mn\n      Bit rate : 447 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 6 channels\n      Channel positions : Front: L C R, Rear: L R, Subwoofer\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 293 MiB\n\nIMDB: tt0499238\n\nTibetan audio, English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted originally at KG by Odin","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7786f54dd2e966c8d53c68f28e6f00dbedfb441c","amp;dn":"Milarepa+%28Bhutan%29+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7786f54dd2e966c8d53c68f28e6f00dbedfb441c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,134,245,77,210,233,102,200,213,60,104,242,142,111,0,219,237,251,68,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
