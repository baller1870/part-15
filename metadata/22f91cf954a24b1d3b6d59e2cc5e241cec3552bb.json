Martin P. Keerns. (2013)\n\n *This book was written by one of our own concen members.\n\n Greetings my fellow truth seeker. My name is Martin Keerns, I have passionately researched, compiled, and edited the following series of books for you with much love, care, and dedication over the last 5 years. - Thousands of hours of demanding work went into what you are about to read. \n\n I take great pleasure in finally being able to present to you this the first section of my work: - Hopefully this will have been for your benefit first of all, but perhaps also just a little bit for your pleasure. (As you will discover if you read this, I have quite a wicked and very dry sense of humour). \n\n These first four books when taken together make up just one small part of a meganormously extensive four part series of work that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve dubbed the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Grand Unified Theory SeriesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nThis initial section has been titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Notice of IntentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (This is for a number of reasons that will become abundantly clear to anyone who does bother to read it all the way through).\n\n This section deals with a whole range of issues, ALL concerning one thing in particular - CONTROL.\n\n Part One - Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sex, Drugs, Rock and KontrolÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ The first book looks at social control, being enforced through mind control, largely for the purpose of population control. I also lay out hundreds of pages of very hard hitting no-punches-pulled information, (including some quite rare or Ã¢â‚¬Å“hard to come byÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ articles) on a subject that REALLY rips my knitting more than anything else. - Organised paedophilia.\n\n Part Two - Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dumbed down word controlled monkeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s who think that keeping up with the JonesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and not being the stupidest guy or gal in the room is ALL that really mattersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ concentrates on the multi-faceted and ubiquitous methods of mind control that are routinely being used on entire populations by our wanabee owners to train, manipulate, condition, and herd, (yet at the same time alienate us from each other) every single day of our lives from the womb to the cold dark tomb. \n\n Part Three - Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Needle and the Damage DoneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ this third part of the section quite literally bulges to the point of bursting trying to contain all of the crucial facts detailing all the different Ã¢â‚¬Å“weaponsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that are being utilised by the small group of rich, influential psychoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (who we allow to be in charge) who collectively are doing EVERYTHING they can to limit our numbers using population control. \n\n Part Four - To end the first section we have Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Random Collection of Conspiracy Facts for One to Theorise OnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which demonstrates the truly endemic nature of all this control that I have been highlighting in the previous three works. There are subjects that could have been included in the earlier parts but that ultimately didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make it solely because I tried to maintain Ã¢â‚¬Å“themesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the earlier books. - But that has absolutely no bearing on their quality, (in fact my first chapter on the moon landings, in my own honest, humble, and modest opinion, nails this subject better than any other individual has done on their own before me). The second half of the book also seriously examines, in great detail, money, banking, and world finance in general for some 500 odd pages. \n I saw which way the wind was blowing before I ever started this project, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve known right from day one that it wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be too long a period of time before our would be owners would find ways to limit our access to the treasure trove of information that is Ã¢â‚¬Å“the netÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Blocking sites, disappearing sites (articles and books), subscription only access to newspaper archives - these have all proven my hunch to be right. That is why all of my books contain hundreds of these articles in their entirety. They also contain loads of diagrams, charts, graphs, pictures, and the original documents that I cite. \n\n This was always intended to be a comprehensive reference work from its inception (which is why the books are each on average something like 900 pages long). This isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a quick concise opinion or two: \n This is truly a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Grand Unified TheoryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nEnjoy, and please do make an effort to share. Much Love to you all. Your good friend Martin Keerns.\n\n Part Four: A Random Collection of Conspiracy Facts for One to Theorise On\n\n Introduction - Pages 1 to 4. Contents - Pages this one and the next one too.\n\n Chapter 44. The Moon Landings: Part One - Ã¢â‚¬Å“BeforeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Pages 9 to 40. - WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to the moon in a four-parter. This first portion looks at the space programme before the landings. \n\n Chapter 44. The Moon Landings: Part Two - Ã¢â‚¬Å“On the Way ThereÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Pages 42 to 50. - Some extremely peculiar goings on that seemingly transpired en-route to the moon. \n\n Chapter 44. The Moon Landings: Part Three - Ã¢â‚¬Å“Walking on the MoonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Pages 52 to 93.\n\n Chapter 44. The Moon Landings: Part Four Ã¢â‚¬Å“AfterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Pages 95 to 116. - The last part of this chapter tries to stifle a laugh while recounting the absurdity that is the ongoing cover-up.\n\n These next four chapters solidify the case concerning population control - they probably all should have been put into book three but I felt 1100 pages was already daunting enough.\n\n Chapter 45. - Agenda 21 and Codex Alimentarius. Pages 118 to 176. - We return to matters more terrestrial with this chapter covering two ultra-nefarious plans to speed along the previously discussed Ã¢â‚¬Å“thinning outÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of this planetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s population. - The former subject causes Ã¢â‚¬Å“Arrested DevelopmentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on a planetary scale, the latter seeks to control, limit and even ban some of our food, classify herbs as drugs like heroin, and also wreck the vitamin industry.\n\n Chapter 46. The Food Crisis: Part One. Pages 178 to 213. - Three-parter closely examining the subject of food. This part looks at the stranglehold a small gang has on our food supply.\n\n Chapter 46. The Food Crisis: Part Two. Pages 215 to 282. - In this second helping we take a real close look at the Ã¢â‚¬Å“bad-boyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ poster child for all psychopathic corporations - Monsanto.\n\n Chapter 46. The Food Crisis: Part Three. Pages 284 to 303. In this final bit on food we review the purposefully created food crisis coming to an empty supermarket near you soon.\n\n Chapter 47. Global Warming. Pages 305 to 351. - Believe it or not this subject is all about Ã¢â‚¬Å“Arrested DevelopmentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ too. The farcical Ã¢â‚¬Å“scienceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is shown as the tool of death that it is.\n\n Chapter 48. Peak Oil. Pages 353 to 392. - The last of this quartet of stragglers not good enough for book three ends with private, corporation and governmental exploitation of the oil industry. Also as a bonus: - Find out what the interesting term Ã¢â‚¬Å“Oil is AbioticÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ means. \n\n Chapter 49. The Corporation. Pages 394 to 466. - I use this chapter to highlight one of the main vehicles of choice for many of those darn sneaky plans that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve just been spending all my time warning you about: The Corporation. - The truly psychopathic nature of this monster is shown to be completely undeniable; I also show in detail that many of the major institutions supposedly making up the spine of our Ã¢â‚¬Å“SocietyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are nothing but ran-for-profit corporations. With most being ran in just as pathologically selfish a manner as any other of these soul destroying, money grabbing, FrankensteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. - Our Police ForceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, Law Courts, MPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, CouncilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, and even our fucking CountryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s are ALL just corporations.\n\n Chapter 50. Money. Part One: Banking for Beginners. Pages 468 to 532. - I start off this slightly elongated Ã¢â‚¬Å“chapterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by explaining the fundamentals of banking - unfortunately it ainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fun, but trust me, once the created from the ether penny drops, you will go demental.\n\n Chapter 50. Money. Part Two: The Credit Crunch/Financial Tsunami. Pages 534 to 637. - The recent Ã¢â‚¬Å“Credit CrunchÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was the first stage of a major financial attack on our pockets and senses. We spend the first of four chapters at Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ground ZeroÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of the attack - The USA.\n\n Chapter 50. Money. Part Three: Quantitative Easing and Total US Debt. Pages 639 to 651. - In part two of the USA quadrllogy we try to catch up with the true grand total for the ever growing US debt. We also look at the pathetic US Ã¢â‚¬Å“band-aidÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for this spurting carotid - Quantitative Easing. - Notice how their schemes always have cute or benign names like Quantitative Easing, at worst it sounds like a laxative. Credit Crunch actually sounds tasty. \n\n Chapter 50. Money. Part Four: The Fiscal Cliff. Pages 653 to 666. - Just went it couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get worse for Uncle Sam, a crisis with cliff in the name - must be some seriously fucked up shit! \n\n Chapter 50. Money.

Pages 745 to 773. - This chapter nearly got added on to the end of the one on Ã¢â‚¬Å“the corporationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. - I have decided to put it on my mini-world Ã¢â‚¬Å“tourÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ instead, as IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never been to Africa before. \n\n Chapter 50. Money. Part Eight: The effects on the EU. Pages 775 to 799. - We conclude our short tour of devastation by coming back home to Europe. We also get to see one of the true long term Ã¢â‚¬Å“goalsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“aimsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of this financial malarkey coming into play for the first time.\n\n Chapter 50. Money. Part Nine: The Country No-One Mentions - Iceland. Pages 801 to 815. - Here lies the best answer to our money problems, and also the solution to the imminent Ã¢â‚¬Å“FinancageddonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. - If we choose to wisely follow the example of these brave people we can quickly sort this mess out ourselves. If the Scottish EVER want to be independent: Read This.\n\n These next three chapters will detail exactly where many of us will be headed if we choose not to sort this mess out for ourselves, or if we just keep trusting the advice of Ã¢â‚¬Å“expertsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nChapter 50. Money. Part Ten: The Impending Doom! Pages 817 to 828.\n\n Chapter 50. Money. Part Eleven: Economic Suicide. Pages 830 to 835.\n\n Chapter 50. Money. Part Twelve: Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Predict a RiotÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.

Part Fifteen: The Austrian School. Pages 909 to 930. What is it with the schools in this region? Frankfurt, Prussian, and now Austrian, all nuttier than squirrel shit.\n\n Chapter 50. Money. Part Sixteen: Derivatives. Pages 932 to 954. - The next three mini chapters (up to part 18) all look at some secretive financial matters that dwarf Ã¢â‚¬Å“The CrunchÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in scale, but youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never ever get to hear anyone talk openly about these issues.\n\n Chapter 50. Money. Part Seventeen: LIBOR. Pages 956 to 964. A scam so massive, involving so many countless Trillions, that it appears that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too big to mention. (On the news)\n\n Chapter 50. Money. Part Eighteen: CAFRÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. Pages 966 to 984. This one will blow your socks off - governments are hiding enough money off the books to easily clear all national debts.\n\n Chapter 50. Money.
