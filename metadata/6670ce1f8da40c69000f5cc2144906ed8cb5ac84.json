Theirs is a reincarnationist philosophy and they believe that, as initiates of the highest order, they return in local groups at key moments to conspire to change the course of events. Whether or not their beliefs are right, whether or not their magical practices work in the way they believe, this book seeks to prove that certain remarkable individuals, many of them famous in other areas - such as Leonardo da Vinci, Newton and Goethe, have undoubtedly held these beliefs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6670ce1f8da40c69000f5cc2144906ed8cb5ac84","amp;dn":"Mark+Hedsel+-+The+Zelator+-+A+Modern+Initiate+Explores+the+Ancie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6670ce1f8da40c69000f5cc2144906ed8cb5ac84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,112,206,31,141,164,12,105,0,15,92,194,20,73,6,237,140,181,172,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
