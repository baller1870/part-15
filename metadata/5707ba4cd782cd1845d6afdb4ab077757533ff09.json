He agrees to their $500 fee, payable when the job is complete to the widow of another man he killed, and sets about freeing the town from it's wheelchair-bound criminal boss, who hires three killers in succession to rid the town of its new lawman\n\nSet in a small Arizona town in the 1870s, Four Fast Guns is a subpar Western about Sabin (James Craig), a man who takes on an unlikely tyrant in an effort to restore normal life to the townspeople. Sabin himself has been falsely accused of murder, though misconduct runs in the family -- his brother Johnny (Brett Halsey) is an outlaw. An invalid runs the local saloon and has parleyed his physical infirmity into an excuse to get away with a brutal hold over the town. Sabin challenges his authority, so the saloon-keeper sends one hired gun after another to kill him off. No one succeeds, but then the fourth gunman shows up -- Sabin's outlaw brother -- and the two siblings are forced into a fatal confrontation.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 4514 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 448kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 6\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime: 81 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]   \nDuration: 81 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5707ba4cd782cd1845d6afdb4ab077757533ff09","amp;dn":"Four+Fast+Guns+%281959%29+DVD5+-+James+Craig%2C+Martha+Vickers%2C+Brett+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5707ba4cd782cd1845d6afdb4ab077757533ff09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,7,186,76,215,130,205,24,69,214,175,219,74,176,119,117,117,51,255,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
