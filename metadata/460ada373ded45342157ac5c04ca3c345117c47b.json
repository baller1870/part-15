This collection includes the cities and countryside in places such as; Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Greece, and many Great Cities in the rest of Europe. The filming was done on helicopter mounted high-definition cameras. The result is some of the most beautiful looks at Europe that can be seen without leaving your home. The aerial views are amazing, giving you glimpses of the popular destinations that cannot be seen from the ground. Whether highlighting the vast untouched natural destinations, such as mountain ranges, lakes, and rivers, or the cities that are mixtures of old and new architecture, the episodes give breathtaking views. Even if you have been to some of the destinations, you will love to see them from the air. It gives the landscape a whole new look.\n\n\n\n\n8)  Sicily \nVisions of Sicily is a guided tour physically impossible by any other means, informed by a narrative as richly textured as the island's rocky crags and set to a soundtrack distinctly Sicilian in its variety.

Join us for a seamless tour marked by blankets of lush green, terracotta rooftops, azure waters, and the seductive haze of volcanic craters. Striking views - from as high as 3,250 ft above sea level - showcase Cefalu, Palermo, Termini Imerse,Trapani, Marsala, Agrigento, Siracusa, Catania, Taormina, Mount Etna and more\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img441/4461/visionsofeuropescreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img441/4461/visionsofeuropescreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img41/16/visionsofeuropescreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img41/16/visionsofeuropescreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img441/7595/visionsofeuropescreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img441/7595/visionsofeuropescreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img43/3527/visionsofeuropescreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img43/3527/visionsofeuropescreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img22/2798/visionsofeuropescreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img22/2798/visionsofeuropescreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img513/1345/visionsofeuropescreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img513/1345/visionsofeuropescreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img255/7568/visionsofeuropescreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img255/7568/visionsofeuropescreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img42/9319/visionsofeuropescreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img42/9319/visionsofeuropescreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img705/3315/visionsofeuropescreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img705/3315/visionsofeuropescreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1706\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 56.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 16\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:460ada373ded45342157ac5c04ca3c345117c47b","amp;dn":"Visions+of+Europe+08of16+Sicily+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"460ada373ded45342157ac5c04ca3c345117c47b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,10,218,55,61,237,69,52,33,87,172,92,4,202,60,52,81,23,196,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
