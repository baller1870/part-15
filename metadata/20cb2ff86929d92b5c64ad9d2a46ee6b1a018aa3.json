In retrospect, it's sort of hard to see how this record, with its loving debts to Southern rock and AOR anthems, ever shared airplay on modern rock radio stations and 120 Minutes, but that's just the way things were in the heady days of 1994. Ironically, Collective Soul succeeded where cult heroes Urge Overkill couldn't ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹ making late-'70s arena rock popular. Urge, of course, was a band of hardcore ironists, where the members of Collective Soul were dogged traditionalists, which sells better with a mainstream audience, and that's part of the reason why this debut was a hit. The other reason is that the band hits the riff jackpot a couple of times here: &quot;Wasting Time&quot; and &quot;Love Lifted Me&quot; are strong classicist rock, but &quot;Shine&quot; is a tremendous guilty pleasure, built on a guitar riff so indelible you swear it's stolen, blessed by a sighing melody that makes this a fine album-rock single that would have sounded as good in '74 as it did in '94. This is the song that signaled that the group had the skills and smarts to be a first-rate singles band, even if the rest of the record vacillates between pleasant and forgettable filler.        \n01 Shine                       Roland                                       5:07    \n02 Goodnight, Good Guy         Childress, Evans, Roland, Roland, Turpin     3:27    \n03 Wasting Time                Childress, Evans, Roland, Roland, Turpin     3:15    \n04 Sister Don't Cry            Childress, Evans, Roland, Roland, Turpin     4:02    \n05 Love Lifted Me              Childress, Evans, Roland, Roland, Turpin     3:49    \n06 In a Moment                 Childress, Evans, Roland, Roland, Turpin     3:54    \n07 Heaven's Already Here       Childress, Evans, Roland, Roland, Turpin     2:13    \n08 Pretty Donna [instrumental] Childress, Evans, Roland, Roland, Turpin     1:58    \n09 Reach                       Childress, Evans, Roland, Roland, Turpin     4:22    \n10 Breathe                     Childress, Evans, Roland, Roland, Turpin     3:05    \n11 Scream                      Childress, Evans, Roland, Roland, Turpin     2:56    \n12 Burning Bridges             Childress, Evans, Roland, Roland, Turpin     3:38    \n13 All                         Childress, Evans, Roland, Roland, Turpin     3:28 \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20cb2ff86929d92b5c64ad9d2a46ee6b1a018aa3","amp;dn":"Collective+Soul+-+1993+-+Hints+Allegations+and+Things+Left+Unsai","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20cb2ff86929d92b5c64ad9d2a46ee6b1a018aa3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,203,47,248,105,41,217,43,92,100,173,157,42,70,238,107,26,1,138,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
