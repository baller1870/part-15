With a top speed of 100mph thanks to all cars being driven, the Class 170 also proved capable of longer journeys, and altogether 122 sets were built. The Class 171 is identical apart from having Dellner couplings rather than the BSI type found on the Class 170. The Class 170 for Train Simulator has realistic controls and sounds and includes a selection of liveries and a Class 171 variant. \n\n\nPlease support the developers and buy some of their content if you can afford it.\n\n\nFor questions, support and requests join here:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.railworkscentral.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.railworkscentral.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nemail for support:\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;aadecfcbc7dedac89ecfdccfd8eacdc7cbc3c684c9c5c7&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nA Team tpb_4_ever upload.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f25a0ef5187e7bffac7b525194500b4845c1f304","amp;dn":"Railworks+4+Class+170+-+Updated","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f25a0ef5187e7bffac7b525194500b4845c1f304","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,90,14,245,24,126,123,255,172,123,82,81,148,80,11,72,69,193,243,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
