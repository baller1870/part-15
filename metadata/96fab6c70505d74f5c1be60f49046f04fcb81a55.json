The hero of the war, he had a small ream of paperwork to fill out, a deployment with his Navy F-18 squadron to prepare for, and a new girlfriend to spend some quality time with. Life was good.\n\nUntil the aliens showed up.\n\nThey had a ship and needed to get to their home planet, but didn't have a crew. They had seen Calvin's unit in action, though, and knew it was the right one for the job. There was just one small problem--a second race of aliens was coming, which would end all life on Earth. Calvin's platoon might want to do something about that, too.\n\nHaving won a terrestrial war with 30 troops, winning an interstellar war with nothing but a 3,000 year old cruiser should be easy, right?\n\nGenre: Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96fab6c70505d74f5c1be60f49046f04fcb81a55","amp;dn":"Janissaries+by+Chris+Kennedy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96fab6c70505d74f5c1be60f49046f04fcb81a55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,250,182,199,5,5,215,79,92,27,230,15,73,4,111,4,252,184,26,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
