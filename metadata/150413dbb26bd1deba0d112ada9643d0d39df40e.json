It can be used with FAT, NTFS or any other file system, and also with unformatted or unpartitioned disks. \n\nBootable regenerating diskette allows starting regenerating process under DOS automatically. The diskette can be created under Windows 95 / 98 / ME / NT4 / 2000 / XP / 2003\n\nMain benefits \n\nHard disk drive is an integral part of every computer. It stores all your information. One of the most prevalent defects of hard drives is bad sectors on the disk surface. Bad sectors are a part of the disk surface which contains not readable, but frequently necessary information. As a result of bad sectors you may have difficulties to read and copy data from your disk, your operating system becomes unstable and finally your computer may unable to boot altogether. When a hard drive is damaged with bad sectors, the disk not only becomes unfit for use, but also you risk losing information stored on it. The HDD Regenerator can repair damaged hard disks without affecting or changing existing data. As a result, previously unreadable and inaccessible information is restored. \n\nHow it works \n\nAlmost 60% of all hard drives damaged with bad sectors have an incorrectly magnetized disk surface. We have developed an algorithm which is used to repair damaged disk surfaces. This technology is hardware independent, it supports many types of hard drives and repairs damage that even low-level disk formatting cannot repair. As a result, previously unreadable information will be restored. Because of the way the repair is made, the existing information on the disk drive will not be affected! \n\nImportant notes \n\nSince the program does not change the logical structure of a hard drive, the file system may still show some sectors marked earlier as &amp;#039;bad&amp;#039;, and other disk utilities such as Scandisk will detect logical bad sectors even though the disk has been successfully regenerated and is no longer damaged by physical bad sectors. If you want to remove these marks, repartition the hard disk drive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:150413dbb26bd1deba0d112ada9643d0d39df40e","amp;dn":"HDD+Regenerator+v1.42+Bootable+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"150413dbb26bd1deba0d112ada9643d0d39df40e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,4,19,219,178,107,209,222,186,13,17,42,218,150,67,208,211,157,244,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
