This course is an entry point into both the Web application and Windows Store apps training paths and helps prepare learners for Microsoft exam 70-480. The course focuses on using HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript to implement programming logic, define and use variables, perform looping and branching, develop user interfaces, capture and validate user input, store data, and create well-structured applications. This course uses Visual Studio 2012, running on Windows 8.\n\nAudience Profile | The course is intended for developers who have at least six months of professional experience and who are interested in developing applications using HTML5 with JavaScript and CSS3 (either Windows Store apps or IE10 apps for the Web). While the students may have little or no HTML5 coding experience, they should have some experience with HTML4.\n\nThe popular Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jump StartÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ virtual classroom experience leverages two experts and an engaging team-teaching approach. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re excited to introduce Jeremy Foster and Michael Palermo - two seasoned Microsoft Technical Evangelists with real world experience developing applications using a wide array of platforms and languages. Both Jeremy and Michael share a passion for creating powerful solutions leveraging HTML, CSS and JavaScript and are excited to dive into these topics together.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48570960e05c86051ee94bba1565cedf788e8b71","amp;dn":"Developing+Win8+App+with+HTML5%2C+CSS3+and+JavaScript+-+Jump+Start","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48570960e05c86051ee94bba1565cedf788e8b71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,87,9,96,224,92,134,5,30,233,75,186,21,101,206,223,120,142,139,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
