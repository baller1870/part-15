Students of military history have long recognized the importance of Kursk, also known as &quot;Operation Citadel,&quot; and there have been several serious studies of the battle. Yet, the German view of the battle has been largely ignored.After the war, U.S. Army Intelligence officers gathered German commanders' post-war reports of the battle. Due, in part, to poor translations done after the war, these important documents have been overlooked by World War II historians. Steven H. Newton has collected, translated, and edited these accounts, including reports made by the Chiefs of Staff of Army Group South and the Fourth Panzer Army, and by the Army Group Center Operations Officer. As a result, a new and unprecedented picture of German strategy and operations is made available. The translated staff reports are supplemented by Newton's commentary and original research, which challenges a number of widely accepted ideas about this pivotal battle.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Kursk-German-Steven-H-Newton/dp/0306811502/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371678586&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=kursk+the+german+view&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Kursk-German-Steven-H-Newton/dp/0306811502/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371678586&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=kursk+the+german+view&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dfe20055607e59256215d5b7c24273dc2032a66","amp;dn":"Kursk%3A+The+German+View","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dfe20055607e59256215d5b7c24273dc2032a66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,254,32,5,86,7,229,146,86,33,93,91,124,36,39,61,194,3,42,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
