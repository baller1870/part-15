But now something - or someone - is attacking Cincinnati and the Hollows, causing spells to backfire or go horribly wrong while living vampires attack humans and Inderlanders alike.\n\nThe pressures build when the city is quarantined to contain the unreliable magic, and Rachel must stop the attacks before the undead vampire masters who keep the rest of the undead under control are lost and it becomes all-out supernatural war.\n\nThe only way to do so is through the ancient elven magic, but that carries its own perils - for magic always has a price, and gods do not come lightly when called.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de2d64e00c933774d93a4bfe3bb3eecb09c3ea0f","amp;dn":"Kim+Harrison+Rachel+Morgan+Book+12+The+Undead+Pool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de2d64e00c933774d93a4bfe3bb3eecb09c3ea0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,45,100,224,12,147,55,116,217,58,75,254,59,179,238,203,9,195,234,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
