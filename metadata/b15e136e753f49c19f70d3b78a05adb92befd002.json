It is sometimes not as indepth as I would like in certain areas, but none the less it's extremely enjoyable.  The author shows great knowledge in all aspects of modern warfare, and is able to draw these three conflicts into each other.

Casualty lists reached unimagined proportions as the same ground -- places like Ypres and the Somme -- was fought over again and again. Other major bloody battles remain vivid in memory to this day: Gallipoli and the Battle of Jutland are but two examples. Europe was at war with itself, and the effect on Western civilization was profound, its repercussions felt even today.\nWorld War I saw the introduction of modern technology into the military arena: The tank, airplane, machine gun, submarine, and -- most lethal of all -- poison gas, all received their first widespread use. Professor Stokesbury analyzes these technological innovations and the war's complex military campaigns in lucid detail. At the same time he discusses the great political events that unfolded during the war, such as the Russian Revolution and the end of the Hapsburg dynasty, putting the social and political side of the war into the context of modern European history.\n\nA Short History of World War I is the first history of this war to be written in twenty years. It incorporates recent research and current thinking about the war in a highly readable and lively style.\n\n\nCustomer Reviews\n19 Reviews \n5 star:    (8) \n4 star:    (4) \n3 star:    (5) \n2 star:    (1) \n1 star:    (1) \n      \n    \nAverage Customer Review \n3.9 out of 5 stars (19 customer reviews) \n  \n \n\n\n\n==========================================================================\n\n\nWORLD WAR 2\n\nProduct Description\nDespite the numerous books on World War II, until now there has been no one-volume survey that was both objective and comprehensive. Previous volumes have usually been written from an exclusively British or American point of view, or have ignored the important causes and consequences of the War. \n\nA Short History of World War II is essentially a military history, but it reaches from the peace settlements of World War I to the drastically altered postwar world of the late 1940's. Lucidly written and eminently readable, it is factual and accurate enough to satisfy professional historians. A Short History of World War II will appeal equally to the general reader, the veteran who fought in the War, and the student interested in understanding the contemporary political world. \n\n\nCustomer Reviews\n22 Reviews \n5 star:    (14) \n4 star:    (7) \n3 star:     (0) \n2 star:     (0) \n1 star:    (1) \n      \n    \nAverage Customer Review \n4.5 out of 5 stars (22 customer reviews) \n  \n \n\n\n==========================================================================\n\n\nTHE KOREAN WAR\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\nAs pungent and concise as his short histories of both world wars, Stokesbury's survey of &quot;the half war&quot; takes a broad view and seems to leave nothing out but the details. The first third covers the North Korean invasion of June 1950, the Pusan perimeter crisis, MacArthur's master stroke at Inchon and the intervention by Chinese forces that November. At this point, other popular histories of the war reach the three-quarter mark, ending often with a cursory summary of the comparatively undramatic three-and-a-half years required to bring the war to its ambiguous conclusion on July 27, 1953. Stokesbury renders the latter period as interesting as the operational fireworks of the first six months: the Truman-MacArthur controversy; the political limitations on U.S. air power; the need for the Americans to fight the war as cheaply as possible, due to NATO commitments; the prolonged negotiations at Panmunjom over the prisoner-exchange issue; and the effect of the war on the home front. Whether the United States could have/should have stayed out of the war in the first place comes under discussion: &quot;no&quot; on both counts, according to the author. \n\n\nCustomer Reviews\n12 Reviews \n5 star:    (8) \n4 star:    (3) \n3 star:    (1) \n2 star:     (0) \n1 star:     (0) \n      \n    \nAverage Customer Review \n4.6 out of 5 stars (12 customer reviews) \n  \n \n\n\n==========================================================================\n\nAll Audiobooks are Unabridged, check my other torrents for more great Historical Audiobooks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b15e136e753f49c19f70d3b78a05adb92befd002","amp;dn":"A+Short+History+of+WW1+-+WW2+-+The+Korean+War+%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b15e136e753f49c19f70d3b78a05adb92befd002","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,94,19,110,117,63,73,193,159,112,211,183,138,5,173,185,43,239,208,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
