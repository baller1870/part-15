They have lived alone for years in their own private world, full of memories and daily rituals. Sometimes they seem like brothers. Sometimes even like lovers. Following in his father's footsteps, Alexei attends military school. He likes sports, tends to be irresponsible and has problems with his girlfriend. She is jealous of Alexei's close relationship with his father. Despite knowing that all sons must one day live their own lives, Alexei is conflicted. Alexei's father knows he should maybe accept a better job in another city, maybe search for a new wife. But who will ease the pain of Alexei's nightmares?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c36201d39afb9c8a1d0bb42ab75527c076d63c25","amp;dn":"Otets+i+Syn+aka+Father+and+Son+2003+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c36201d39afb9c8a1d0bb42ab75527c076d63c25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,98,1,211,154,251,156,138,29,11,180,42,183,85,39,192,118,214,60,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
