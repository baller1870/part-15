VIDEO\nVIDEO CARD CAPABILITY\nBackyard Baseball 2005 must be played on a video card capable of 640x480 screen resolution at a bit depth setting of 16 bits. The card and software drivers must be DirectX 9.0 (or higher) compatible. If you experience problems or difficulty with graphics, contact your card manufacturer for the latest documentation and drivers.\n\nDISPLAY SETTINGS\nThe game will launch and lock your resolution to 640x480 with a bit depth of 16 bits.\n\nFor users with better video cards, you can adjust graphical settings like Anti-Aliasing or Gamma Correction in your Control Panel.\nE.G. Right Click DesktopPropertiesSettingsAdvanced(Video Card)(Performance and Quality)\n\nSOUND AND VIDEO DRIVERS\nIf you are experiencing any difficulties running the game, be sure that your sound card drivers and video drivers are up to date. \n\nKNOWN ISSUES: \n* Backyard Baseball 2005 does not run on a Radeon 7500, Matrox G200, NVidia Riva 128, 3DFX Voodoo 2, Sis 315, and any 3DLabs Permedia video card.\n* Some Matrox cards have had some graphical issues in Darts and other areas in the game.\n* Some ATI cards have had games launch with missing fields after extended play. You can fix this problem by Alt-Tabbing to the desktop and back to the game or by restarting the application.\n* On some slower machines, audio can cut out during the intro movies. There is no known fix for this issue.\n* The XPERT@WORK AGP 2X 8MB ATI Rage Pro card might crash on launch. Other tested 8MB ATI Rage Pro cards seemed to run without issue.\n\nSOFTWARE RENDERED VERSION:\n*For games with some video card problems, you can start the game running a special executable located in the Start Menu at: Programs &amp;gt; Atari &amp;gt; Backyard Baseball 2005 &amp;gt; Backyard Baseball Software Rendered. This mode works better on machines with faster CPUs. Movies and scoreboards may have artifacts around them when played in this mode. NOTE: Software Rendering mode doesn't run on the ATI Radeon 7500 or 8500. \n\nNOTE: Real-time Virus Scanning can cause framerate drops. If you are experiencing framerate issues, disabling virus scan software can create better performance.\n\n\nV. DISK CAPACITY AND SWAPFILE SPACE\n\nBackyard Baseball 2005 requires approximately 750MB of hard drive space.\n\nA swap file (virtual memory) is temporary storage space on your hard drive which programs use for \ntemporary storage of data.

For best results, you should let Windows Manage the Virtual memory for you.\n\nVI.
