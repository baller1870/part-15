Surprising details reveal \n\t\t   the bold choices and almost godlike power Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee summoned on decisive \n\t\t   battlefields like Vicksburg and Gettysburg that, within days of each other, turned the tide of the \n\t\t   war. This special features a unique perspective, exploring how these men changed the course of \n\t\t   American history.\n\nProper Notes.....: Let's see...first off, CRiMSON's release has a commercial from 22m40s-22m50s. Their release is\n\t\t   also overcropped on the bottom. Last but not least, there are interlacing artifacts throughout the\n\t\t   release. Nearly every interview scene has artifacts on the face and hands of the interviewee.\n\t\t   You're probably wondering how you could possibly get interlacing artifacts from a progressive\n\t\t   source. Personally, I would assume that CRiMSON's release is from an analog source. In the provided\n\t\t   screenshot comparison you'll notice that the face on CRiMSON's release is unusually red and blurry\n\t\t   in addition to the guy's hand being completely interlaced. If you'd like to check for yourself, the\n\t\t   time stamp for those screenshots are 1.15.12 (CRiMSON) and 1.15.05 (DiVERGE).\n\t\t  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dd974d423bd23fbf6786c82cc4fbe15ad07aa87","amp;dn":"History.Channel.Lee.and.Grant.PROPER.HDTV.XviD-DiVERGE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dd974d423bd23fbf6786c82cc4fbe15ad07aa87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,217,116,212,35,189,35,251,246,120,108,130,204,79,190,21,173,7,170,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
