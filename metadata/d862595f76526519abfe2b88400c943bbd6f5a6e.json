Le Petit Soldat has been transferred to disc in its original full-frame aspect ratio of 1.33:1, and while the images sometimes look a bit rough (as was intended), the source materials look clean and well cared for, and Raoul Coutard's energetic cinematography is well served here. The audio has been mastered in Dolby Digital Stereo (retaining the original single channel sound mix), and sounds good considering its vintage, if not great. The dialogue is in French, with optional English language subtitles. Bonus materials include a chat on the film and its politics from critic and film historian David Sterritt, which is illustrated with clips from the picture, as well as filmographies for Godard and actors Michel Subor and Anna Karina and a page of internet web links. If this isn't a definitive presentation of Le Petit Soldat, it's a very good one, and should certainly satisfy most film enthusiasts interested in Godard's work.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Le Petit Soldat.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.10 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 24mn\n      Bit rate : 1853 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 8.08 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n      IAS1 : Francais\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : Yes\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 24mn\n      Bit rate : 1767 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.229\n      StreamSize : 1.04 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 24mn\n      Bit rate : 79 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 32 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 47.8 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.97 \n      Encoding settings : ABR\n\nIMDB: tt0054177\n\nFrench audio, Multilanguage subpack (English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, etc), English .srt subtitle.\n\nTorrent includes Trailer and Introduction by Colin MacCabe.\n\nPosted originally at Karagarga by kegir, who deserves all credits.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d862595f76526519abfe2b88400c943bbd6f5a6e","amp;dn":"Jean-Luc+Godard+-+Le+Petit+Soldat+%281960%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d862595f76526519abfe2b88400c943bbd6f5a6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,98,89,95,118,82,101,25,171,254,43,136,64,12,148,59,189,111,90,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
