The album's polished production was a departure from the band's acoustic origins, due in part to the production of the Dust Brothers.\n\n&quot;Tribute&quot; was the first single released from the album, followed by &quot;Wonderboy&quot;. Both singles had music videos filmed for them, with the Liam LynchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“directed Tribute video achieving cult status.\n\nWhile Tenacious D did not achieve chart success after its release, it was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America by the end of 2005. Despite peaking at only #38 in the UK, it has sold over 426,000 copies.\n\n\nBand Bio (from Wikipedia):\nTenacious D is an American rock band that formed in Los Angeles, California in 1994. Comprising lead vocalist and guitarist Jack Black and lead guitarist and vocalist Kyle Gass, the band has released two albums ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Tenacious D (2001) and The Pick of Destiny (2006). The band's studio releases, and more recently its live performances, feature a full band lineup, including such musicians as guitarist John Konesky, bassist John Spiker and drummer Brooks Wackerman.\n\nTenacious D formed in 1994 when the members performed as an acoustic duo. The band first gained popularity in 1999 when they starred in their eponymous television series and began to support large rock acts. In 2001, they released Tenacious D, their debut album featuring a full band. The first single, &quot;Tribute&quot;, was the band's most successful achieving their only Top 10 in any chart, until they released &quot;The Metal&quot;, which was first shown at Saturday Night Live. In 2006, they starred in, and recorded the soundtrack for, the film Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny. In support of the film, the band went on a world tour, appearing for the first time with a full band.\n\nTenacious D's music showcases Black's theatrical vocal delivery and Gass's acoustic guitar playing abilities. Critics have described their fusion of vulgar absurdist comedy with rock music as &quot;mock rock&quot;. Their songs discuss the duo's purported musical and sexual prowess, as well as their friendship and cannabis usage in a style that music critics have compared with the storyteller-style lyrics of rock opera.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c05e03300d1fb7f1a211ff5ab39a7c1b2672512f","amp;dn":"Tenacious+D+-+Tenacious+D+%282001%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c05e03300d1fb7f1a211ff5ab39a7c1b2672512f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,94,3,48,13,31,183,241,162,17,255,90,179,154,124,27,38,114,81,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
