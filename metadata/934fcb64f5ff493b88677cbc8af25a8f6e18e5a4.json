This is Flash Fact: When Barry Allen wakes at his desk, he discovers the world has changed. Family is alive, loved ones are strangers, and close friends are different, gone or worse.

It's a place where America's last hope is Cyborg, who hopes to gather the forces of The Outsider, The Secret 7, S!H!A!Z!A!M!, Citizen Cold and other new and familiar-yetaltered faces! It's a world that could be running out of time, if The Flash can't find the villain who altered the time line!From the Hardcover edition","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:934fcb64f5ff493b88677cbc8af25a8f6e18e5a4","amp;dn":"Flashpoint+003+%28ZOOM-Empire%29+%5BMad.Max%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"934fcb64f5ff493b88677cbc8af25a8f6e18e5a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,79,203,100,245,255,73,59,136,103,124,188,138,242,90,143,110,24,229,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
