The first ten selections are culled from the dreamy mood music album Latin for Lovers ( aka Latin for Lovers With Strings ), and the final ten are from San Francisco Moods, a lean and mean West Coast jazz ode to his hometown. While these two sessions don't really go together, they do show you the breadth of what Tjader was recording for Fantasy at the time. While the Latin for Lovers selections aren't really Latin jazz ( or even 'Latin' or 'jazz,' for that matter ), it is superior mood music with fine string arrangements written by Jack Weeks. If all lounge music was this good, the term couldn't be used as an insult. The soloists don't really stretch out at all, but Tjader, pianist Vince Guaraldi, and flutist Paul Horn each make their presence felt on regal, melodic passages. Willie Bobo and Mongo Santamaria are on the session, but unlike their sizzling one-track cameo on the next session's 'Viva Cepeda,' they are only around to keep strict time. So while the first half of the disc is upscale easy listening, those culled from San Francisco Moods ) show how underrated Tjader was at mainstream small-group jazz. Tjader starts out the session on piano, but on most tracks his vibraphone skills are given a real chance to shine. Tjader was always a giving group leader and guitarist Eddie Duran and the rest of the quartet are featured prominently. San Francisco Moods is an exhilarating session, one that veers from gritty, hard-swinging romps to uptown 'chamber jazz' and back again without a hitch. Cal Tjader had such great success with Latin jazz that listeners and critics have tended to forget that he really was a major part of the cool West Coast jazz scene and that he recorded all kinds of music throughout his career. This CD reissue is a must-have for Cal Tjader fans and one that reminds people how far-reaching the vibraphonist's mainstream musical talent really was. ~ Nick Dedina, AMG\n\nPersonnel: \nCal Tjader ( Vibes, Piano 11, 13 ) \nPaul Horn ( Flute ) 1-10\nVince Guaraldi ( Piano ) 1-10,19\nAl McKibbon ( Double Bass ) 1-10,19\nMongo Santamaria ( Drums, Congas and Percussion ) 1-10,19\nWillie Bobo ( Drums, Congas and Percussion ) 1-10,19\nBoris Blinder ( Strings ) 1-10\nHarry Moulin ( Strings ) 1-10\nFrances Wiener ( Strings ) 1-10\nEugene Winkler ( Strings ) 1-10\nJohn Markham ( Drums ) 11-18,20\nEddie Duran ( Guitar ) 11-18,20\nJohn Mosher ( Bass ) 11-18,20\nJack Weeks ( Bass ) - 20\n\nTracks:\n01  I Should Care ( Axel Stordahl/Paul Weston/Sammy Cahn ) 2:36 \n02  Spring Is Here ( Lorenz Hart/Richard Rodgers ) 2:39 \n03  Time Was ( Bob Russell/Gabriel Luna/Manuel Prado ) 2:59 \n04  Star Eyes ( Don Raye/Gene DePaul ) 3:17 \n05  Stella By Starlight ( Ned Washington/Victor Young ) 3:16 \n06  Alone Together ( Arthur Schwartz/Howard Dietz ) 4:29 \n07  Ode to a Beat Generation ( Jack Weeks ) 2:20 \n08  Skylark ( Hoagy Carmichael/Johnny Mercer ) 2:39 \n09  Martha ( Mongo Santamaria ) 3:10 \n10  Quizas, Quizas, Quizas ( Joe Davis/Osvaldo FarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s ) 4:01 \n11  Running Out ( Cal Tjader ) 3:25 \n12  Raccoon Strait ( Cal Tjader ) 2:28 \n13  The Last Luff ( Cal Tjader ) 3:41 \n14  Sigmund Stern Groove ( John Mosher ) 4:40 \n15  Coit Tower ( Cal Tjader ) 1:38 \n16  Triplet Blues ( Cal Tjader ) 6:03 \n17  Union Square ( John Markham ) 4:23 \n18  Skyline Waltz ( John Mosher ) 3:46 \n19  Viva Cepeda ( Cal Tjader ) 3:43 \n20  The Grant Avenue Suite ( Jack Weeks ) 7:30 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8a2c1975d139cd465fc2783adf6535f492d381e","amp;dn":"Cal+Tjader+-+Sentimental+Moods+%281958%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bscho","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8a2c1975d139cd465fc2783adf6535f492d381e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,162,193,151,93,19,156,212,101,252,39,131,173,246,83,95,73,45,56,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
