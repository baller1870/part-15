In the not-too-distant past, humans shared this planet with other species of hominid. This series tells how, against all the odds, Homo sapiens survived.\n\nPart 1: Homo Erectus\nThis episode is set 75,000 years ago in India, following a catastrophic super-volcanic eruption which forced a showdown between our ancestors and a completely different species of human, Homo erectus, who up until that point had reigned supreme. Homo erectus was a successful, long-lived species that migrated out of Africa. Possibly the first humans to live in hunter-gatherer societies, they also used rafts to travel the oceans.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b80bfb1e5f40bbe3f25d85a7b4657e2fb5debf1d","amp;dn":"Planet+of+the+Apemen%3A+Battle+for+Earth+Part+1+Homo+Erectus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b80bfb1e5f40bbe3f25d85a7b4657e2fb5debf1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,11,251,30,95,64,187,227,242,93,133,167,180,101,126,47,181,222,191,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
