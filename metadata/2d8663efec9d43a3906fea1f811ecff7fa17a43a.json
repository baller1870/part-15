Bittersweet of a feminine voice, yet concealing a disquieting desire and energy. My fascination with this voice finally pushed me to focus the film on a group of female characters, a series of cinematographic portraits on three courageous &quot;butterflies of the night.&quot; Thus the film begins and ends with the song of Huan Shoujuan, a marginal singer songwriter in Beijing. This is my first attempt in making a film on a feminine subject, which has always been scary for me simply because I esteem that it's too delicate for me. Stereotyping, voyeurism is always the temptation. The resulting cinematographic work can never reach the poetry of this divine voice. It makes me realize now how difficult it is to make poetry out of naked reality: it demands a lot of courage and honesty in confronting one's subjective reality Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d8663efec9d43a3906fea1f811ecff7fa17a43a","amp;dn":"Neon+Goddesses+%28Yu+Lik+Wai%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d8663efec9d43a3906fea1f811ecff7fa17a43a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,134,99,239,236,157,67,163,144,111,234,31,129,30,207,247,250,23,164,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
