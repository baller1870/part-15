A gradual loss of innocence, virtue and energy ends in a death white mist of confusion, moral uncertainty and earthly disorder.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c3416cbc9def3909df5933fe3f5475d2c2ac3cc","amp;dn":"The+Poetry+of+Tennyson+-+9+-+Idylls+of+the+KIng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c3416cbc9def3909df5933fe3f5475d2c2ac3cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,52,22,203,201,222,243,144,157,245,147,63,227,245,71,93,44,42,195,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
