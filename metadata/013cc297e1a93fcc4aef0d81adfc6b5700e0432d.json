It features many famous and important musicians and singers, including Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis, Sarah Vaughan, Dizzy Gillespie, George Benson, Luther Vandross, Ice-T, Tevin Campbell and Ray Charles.\n\n   Ella had previously recorded with Jones on her 1963 album Ella and Basie!, which is revered as one of her greatest recordings. Ella is featured on the tracks Jazz Corner of the World (where she is introduced in rap style by Big Daddy Kane), Birdland and Wee B. Dooinit, where she scats alongside Sarah Vaughan and Bobby McFerrin.\n\n   By 1989, the great jazz artists featured on this record were past their respective physical and creative peaks, and their performances on this otherwise exhilarating album merely highlight their respective ages. This was to be the last studio recording that Ella Fitzgerald made, a milestone not lost on her biographer Stuart Nicholson, who noted that Ella had come full circle with this album, her last recording echoing the throwaway pop hits that Norman Granz had promised to rescue her from when he created Verve. It was also Sarah Vaughan's last album.\n\n   Multiple singles were lifted from the album and found success on Pop and R&amp;B radio, including I'll Be Good To You, I Don't Go For That, The Secret Garden (Sweet Seduction Suite), and Tomorrow (A Better You, Better Me). Tomorrow is noteworthy for introducing a young Tevin Campbell to the music scene.\n\n   Back on the Block won the 1991 Grammy Award for Album of the Year.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:013cc297e1a93fcc4aef0d81adfc6b5700e0432d","amp;dn":"Quincy+Jones+-+Back+On+The+Block+%281989%29+%5BLossless%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"013cc297e1a93fcc4aef0d81adfc6b5700e0432d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,60,194,151,225,169,63,204,74,239,13,129,173,252,107,87,0,224,67,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
