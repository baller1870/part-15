Taylor, Harriet de Onis, trans.) - The Devil to Pay in the Backlands (Knopf, 1963). 494 pages.\n\nReprocessed older scan. Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\nThe image pdf that this file is based on was a little rough and not quite hi-res, with the result that this new file, though entirely readable, is a little too big and not as nice as one would hope. However, the pages are split and I think most people will find this file easier to read on various devices than the original.\n\n\nI don't know this book, and it's all but impossible to find a print copy in English, but online sources suggest it's one of the great works of world literature -- with the author being to Brazil what Joyce is to Ireland or Mann to Germany.\n\n\n\nwikipedia:\n\nGrande Sertao: Veredas (Portuguese for &quot;Great Backlands: Tracks&quot;; English translation: The Devil to Pay in the Backlands) is a novel published in 1956 by the Brazilian writer Joao Guimaraes Rosa.\n\nThe original title refers to the veredas - small paths of wetlands usually located at higher altitudes characterized by the presence of grasses and buritizais, groups of the buriti palm-tree (Mauritia flexuosa), that criss-cross the SertÃƒÂ£o region in northern Minas Gerais, Southeast Brazil - as a labyrinthine net where an outsider can easily get lost, and where there is no single way to a certain place, since all paths interconnect in such a way that any road can lead anywhere. The English title refers to a later episode in the book involving an attempt to make a deal with the Devil. Most of the book's spirit is however lost in translation, as the Portuguese original is written in a register that is both archaic and colloquial, making it a very difficult book to translate. The combination of its size, linguistic oddness and polemic themes caused a shock when it was published, but now it is considered one of the most important novels of South American literature. In a 2002 poll of 100 noted writers conducted by Norwegian Book Clubs, the book was named among the top 100 books of all time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:322a27800c4c9c757c5bf6b1bce0de7b23aa0e7a","amp;dn":"Joao+Guimaraes+Rosa+-+The+Devil+to+Pay+in+the+Backlands+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"322a27800c4c9c757c5bf6b1bce0de7b23aa0e7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,42,39,128,12,76,156,117,124,91,246,177,188,224,222,123,35,170,14,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
