Tramps Like Us has consulted with a panel of Bruce experts to\ncreate what they would consider to be the greatest Springsteen concert NEVER played!\nThe setlist was chosen by Mike Appel (Former Springsteen manager &amp; producer), Stan Goldstein (Springsteen\nblogger for NJ.com), Lawrence Kirsch (Author of 2 best selling Springsteen books Ã¢â‚¬Å“For YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Light\nin DarknessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), Thomas Wilkinson (Former program director for SiriusXM's E Street Radio) and Mark Salore\n(Front man of 'Tramps Like Us'). As I read the announcement on backstreets.com and saw the setlist for this\ngig I was very impressed. I had hoped that someone would tape it, but unfortunately it won't. The idea for\nthis compilation was born. Of course, it's a lot of personal taste.\n\nA big thank you goes out to Flynn who gave me many suggestions to select the best version of each track.\nFurther I want to thank you the JEMS crew, Hoserama, Ev2, Spider Web and Fanatic Records for their \npermission to use their work.\n\nAt least, enjoy this compilation!!!\n\nRenÃƒÂ©","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28129a61017cbbfe06f14ede5ceca6baf268150a","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen+%26amp%3B+The+E+Street+Band+Title%3A+The+Turnpike+Is","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28129a61017cbbfe06f14ede5ceca6baf268150a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,18,154,97,1,124,187,254,6,241,78,222,92,236,166,186,242,104,21,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
