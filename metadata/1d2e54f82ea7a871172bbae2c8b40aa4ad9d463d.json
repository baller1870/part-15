This fantastic book uncovers scholars' unquestioned assumptions and shows that by upholding these assumptions researchers obscure the paradoxical nature of strategic reasoning. To uncover the paradoxes of strategic management the author refers to the philosophy of Jacques Derrida. He delves into the internal contradictions that inevitably occur when theorizing about corporate strategy along the dimensions strategy context, process, and content and shows how these paradoxes can enrich future thinking about strategic problems.
