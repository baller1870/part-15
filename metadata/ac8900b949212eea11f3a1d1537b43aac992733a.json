I haven't found a way to remove this without having the password, so Acrobat Pro won't let you edit the document, copy/extract single pages, or change the permissions.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac8900b949212eea11f3a1d1537b43aac992733a","amp;dn":"Flash+Professional+CS6+Visual+QuickStart+Guide+%2B+Video+Fundament","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac8900b949212eea11f3a1d1537b43aac992733a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,137,0,185,73,33,46,234,17,243,161,209,83,123,67,170,201,146,115,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
