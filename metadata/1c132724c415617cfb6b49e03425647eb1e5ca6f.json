It contains mostly files directly ripped from the game by me and converted to mp3 for your convenience. I decided to take on this glorious task because of the seeming lack of well-made OST's on the interwebs. I hope you appreciate my effort:\n\n**Changelog** :\n\n- Fixed minor Tagging Mistakes: &quot;Tainted Love&quot; - BioShock Infinite - OST, Burial at Sea Episode Two - OST, changed &quot;accordeon&quot; into accordion as intended.\n\n- Added as requested &quot;La Vie en Rose (Ingame)&quot;\n\n- Fixed &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot;, replaced &quot;Goodnight, Irene&quot; with a better version (Previous version is now in Extras folder), Fixed &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot;, Added &quot;Fortunate Son (Battle) - inspired by Gardimuer&quot; &amp; &quot; 'Our New Found Shoes' &quot; in Extras of BioShock Infinite - OST\n\n- Added as requested &quot;God Only Knows (Extended)&quot;\n\n\n**Credits** :\n\nBioShock Infinite:\n\n- The Original Soundtrack was not ripped by me nor do I know who did it, so my thanks to you anon.\n\n- Black Gal (Ripped by me from the CD Prison Songs Volume 1)\n\n- Indian Love Call (Which was kindly ripped by a friend of mine from a vinyl) - (Thinking about replacement)\n\nBurial at Sea Episode 1 &amp; 2:\n\n- La Vie en Rose (Intro Audio) by a fellow youtuber who did an awesome job at ripping the game audio. I Ã¢â‚¬Å“borrowedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ this montage of his because it is kind of cool. Check him out here : [https://www[.]youtube[.]com/channel/UCMTiHQINNKbWUgc7g9YDDow] \n\n- Also I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have recreated the La Vie en Rose (Orchestral Version) without his previous work.\n\n- Covers are also made by him, so all rights go to him as well. I remade the cover for episode 1 because I thought a bigger resolution would look better. I was too lazy to remake the cover for episode 2.\n\nIndexing and tagging courtesy of the BioShock Wikia and its associates. (Thank you Gardimuer [https://www[.]youtube[.]com/user/Gardimuer] and Wikia Staff)\n\nIf you have any constructive criticism on the order/tagging and/or the missing songs (if there are any) please make yourself known and I see to it that it will get fixed.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c132724c415617cfb6b49e03425647eb1e5ca6f","amp;dn":"BioShock+Infinite+OST+-+Definitive+Edition+V2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c132724c415617cfb6b49e03425647eb1e5ca6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,19,39,36,196,21,97,124,251,107,73,224,52,37,100,126,177,229,202,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
