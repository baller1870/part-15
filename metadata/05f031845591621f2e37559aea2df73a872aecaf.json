It can be read as a political metaphor or enjoyed as a fine \nlow-budget suspense movie, and it works well either way. Kevin McCarthy stars as \nMiles Bennel, a doctor in the small California community of Santa Mira, where \nseveral patients begin reporting that their loved ones don&amp;#039;t seem to be \nthemselves lately. They look the same but seem cold, emotionally distant, and \nsomehow unfamiliar. The longer Miles looks into these reports, the more stock he \nplaces in them, and in time he makes a shocking discovery: aliens from another \nworld are taking over Santa Mira, one citizen at a time. Emissaries from a \ndistant planet have sent massive seed pods containing creatures that can assume \nthe exact physical likeness of anyone they choose. When Santa Mirans go to \nsleep, the pod creatures take on the shape of their victims and then destroy \ntheir bodies. The aliens may look the same, but they possess no human emotions \nand, like plants, are concerned only with propagating themselves and eventually \nsubsuming the earth. Needless to say, Miles and his friends are terrified, but \nsince it&amp;#039;s hard to tell who&amp;#039;s a person and who&amp;#039;s a pod, they&amp;#039;re at a loss for \nwhat to do, especially when it seems that there are increasingly more aliens \nthan humans. Invasion of the Body Snatchers builds tension slowly and steadily, \ndealing not in the shock of bug-eyed monsters common to other 1950s \nscience-fiction movies but in the unnerving possibility that the enemy is among \nus -- and impossible to tell from our allies. The ultra-paranoid conclusion of \nSiegel&amp;#039;s original cut was softened by Allied Artists, who added a framing device \nthat suggested help was on the way. This coda was as effective in blunting the \nfilm&amp;#039;s grim conclusion as giving a Band-Aid to a beheading victim; few films of \nthe era make it more painfully clear that for these people (and maybe for \nourselves), there&amp;#039;s no turning back and no way home. Keep an eye peeled for a \nbit part by soon-to-be-legendary Western director Sam Peckinpah, who plays a \nmeter reader and also (uncredited) helped write the screenplay. Based on a novel \nby Jack Finney, Invasion of the Body Snatchers was remade in 1978 by Philip \nKaufman and in 1993 by Abel Ferrara (as Body Snatchers); and its influence can \nbe felt from The Stepford Wives (1975) to The X-Files.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCAST\nKevin McCarthy            - Dr. Miles Bennel\nDana Wynter               - Becky Driscoll\nLarry Gates               - Dr. Dan Kauffmann\nKing Donovan              - Jack\nCarolyn Jones             - Theodore\nWhit Bissell              - Dr. Hill\nJean Willes               - Sally\nRalph Dumke               - Nick\nVirginia Christine        - Wilma Lentz\nTom Fadden                - Uncle Ira Lentz\nKenneth Patterson         - Driscoll\nGuy Way                   - Sam Janzek\nEileen Stevens            - Mrs. Grimaldi\nBeatrice Maude            - Grandma\nJean Andren               - Aunt Eleda Lentz\nEverett Glass             - Pursey\nDabbs Greer               - Mac\nPat O&amp;#039;Malley              - Man Carrying Baggage\nGuy Rennie                - Proprietor\nRobert Clark              - Jimmy Grimaldi\nRichard Deacon            - Dr. Harvey Bassett\nDon Siegel \t \nHarry Vejar               - With Man Carrying Baggage \n\nCREW\nDon Siegel                - Director\nWalter Wanger             - Producer\nJack Finney               - Book Author\nDaniel Mainwaring         - Screenwriter\nEllsworth Fredericks      - Cinematographer\nCarmen Dragon             - Composer (Music Score)\nRobert S.

As a sense of paranoia gradually \nspreads, Binnell&amp;#039;s investigations reveal that the complaints are not mere \ndelusion and that the previously peaceful town is in fact being taken over by an \nalien force, doppelgangers who resemble their earthly counterparts in almost \nevery way, save for a lack of human emotion.\n\nAdapted from Jack Finney&amp;#039;s taut novel, Siegel&amp;#039;s low-budget science fiction is \none of the true masterpieces of the genre. Driven by Siegel&amp;#039;s customary pacy \ndirection and his ability to move chameleon-like between genres, the film is \nelevated above its counterparts by a rich intelligence, and screenwriter Daniel \nMainwaring&amp;#039;s subtly integrated subtext and allegorical ambiguity. The sense of \npost-war, anti-communist paranoia is acute, as is the temptation to view the \nfilm as a metaphor for the tyranny of the McCarthy era.\n\nWonderfully performed and imbued with a genuine sense of trepidation and unease, \nthe film was remade to decent effect by Philip Kaufman (original director Don \nSiegel had a small cameo role) in 1978, and by Abel Ferrara in 1993, proving the \ninherent longevity in a tale about the loss of individuality. Incidentally, the \noriginal features Sam Peckinpah in a blink-and-you&amp;#039;ll-miss-him role. Provocative \nfare. \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Steve Biodrowski (Cinefantastiqueonline.com) (August 15, 2007)\n\nThe original 1956 film version of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS is widely \nregarded as a classic, one of the great science fiction films of all time, and \nwith good reason: itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a powerful black-and-white portrait of individuals losing \ntheir humanity as they are taken over and replaced by emotionless duplicates \n(commonly called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpod peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ because they emerge from pods grown from seeds \nfrom outer space). And yet, throughout most of its existence, this film has been \na mixed bag, one that raises interesting questions about how we judge films: do \nwe value them according to whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s actually up on screen, or do we employ some \nmore nebulous system, a combination of rose-colored memories and the authorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \nintentions (whether fully realized or not).\n\nThe movie works in large part because, despite the science-fiction label, it has \nfew visible genre elements. Instead, director Don Siegel films the events as if \nhe were making a film noir thriller, concentrating on the charactersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ \nincreasingly frantic reactions to the gradually escalating conspiracy, which \neventually engulfs them like an unstoppable nightmare.\n\nThings begin calmly enough with Dr. Miles Bennell (Kevin McCarthy) returning to \nhis practice in the small town of Santa Mira after being away at a convention. \nThere seems to be a strange syndrome spreading through the community: people \nconvinced that their friends/family/neighbors are no longer really their \nfriends/family/neighbors but duplicates. At first Bennell dismisses these \ncomplaints, until one of his old friends discovers duplicate bodies growing from \npods in his hot house. Bennell and his old flame, recently divorced Becky \nDriscoll, try to warn the town, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s too late: everyoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s already been \nsnatched. They sneak out of town by acting as if they, too, have been taken \nover, but they betray themselves when they react to the sight of a dog almost \nbeing run over. They run to the hills and hide in an old mine shaft, but Becky \nfalls asleep (the final step that allows the duplicates to replace the original) \nwhile Bennell is looking for help. Bennell manages to get to the main highway, \nbut his cries for help are seen as the ravings of a lunatic, and he catches a \nglimpse of a truck carting pods toward the big cityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\n\nThis is a neat, compact little thriller, without a lot of fat. Without much in \nthe way of production values or visible horror, Siegel manages to wring an \nenormous amount of suspense out of the script(written by Daniel Mainwaring). The \none overtly graphic moment occurs when the seed pods are discovered, disgorging \ntheir duplicate bodies amidst a gurgle of gooey bubbles; itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mild by modern \nstandards but still effective enough to make you queasy.\n\nOtherwise, the film relies on the old stand-by: audience empathy. We fear for \nthe characters, and thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what makes the film scary. The cast is strong, even \nwhen the characters sometimes seem to be a bit slow reacting to the initial \nstages of the invasion (for example, after discovering an anonymous body ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nactually, a half-formed pod person ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ they decide to wait and see what happens, \ninstead of calling the police immediately). McCarthy and Dana Wynter (as Becky) \nmake a great on-screen couple, and it not only frightens ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it really hurts ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nwhen she is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsnatchedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ near the end.\n\nThe climactic shots of McCarthy running down the main highway futilely trying to \nwarn drivers speeding past is a stunning piece of filmmaking that reaches a \nfevered pitch of near hysteria. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re here already! YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re nextÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he cries, \nwhile cars whizz by, ignoring him as if he were nothing but a hopeless nut-case. \nThere have been two remakes (and the 1978 version with Donald Sutherland is not \nbad), but neither one comes close to achieving the excellence of the original, \nwhich remains one of the great paranoid nightmares of cinema.\n\nUnfortunately, the film is not quite as perfect as it might have beenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\n\nSTUDIO INTERFERENCE\n\nBODY SNATCHERS is a compromised film. The studio that financed it did not like \nSiegelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s original downbeat ending, with Kevin McCarthy helplessly running down a \nhighway, unable to divert disaster. A prologue and an epilogue were added, along \nwith a voice-over narration so that the whole story unfolds as if Miles Bennell \nis telling the story in flashback to the police psychiatrist (Whit Bissell). \nAfterward, the shrink is prepared to dismiss him, until a convenient piece of \nevidence pops up to confirm BennellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s story, implying that the alien invasion \nwill be nipped in the bud.\n\nAs if this bogus happy ending were not bad enough, the narration is over-wrought \nand melodramatic, making the film feel more like a bad B-movie than the expert \nlittle piece of craftsmanship that it is. In particular, audience laughter \ninevitably follows one of the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most disturbing moments. Miles Bennell \nreturns to Becky in the mineshaft and realizes she is not really Becky anymore \nwhen he kisses her passionately ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ even desperately ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and gets no emotional \nresponse from her. The look of horror on his face, contrasted with her pitiless \ncontempt, tells us everything we need to know. But then the narration ruins the \nmoment with these words: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI had been afraid many times in my life, but I never \nknew real terror until I kissed Becky.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Even respectful viewers are hard-pressed \nnot to titter.\n\nFor decades, everyone knew there was something wrong with the finished version \nof the movie (including Siegel himself, who objected to the revised ending and \nthe narration, but directed the material anyway, instead of allowing another \ndirector to take over). Yet critics insist on ignoring the flaws ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ most \nrecently, for example, when Time magazineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Richard Corliss and Richard Schickel \nplaced the film on their joint Top 100 Best Films list.\n\nWhy is this? Because we all know what director Don SiegelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s intentions were, and \nthat is what we take away from the film when we leave the theatre. The feeling \nwe carry around in our heads after seeing the movie leaves the studio-enforced \nalterations mentally erased, as it were.\n\nWhatever its unfortunate flaws, INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS was always worth \nseeing, because enough of SiegelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s original survives on the screen to make the \nfilm a genuinely creepy experience ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a horror film not about death and bloodshed \nbut about the loss of personality ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the loss of oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s very self ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which may in a \nsense be the ultimate horror, even worse than death: a sort of emotionless, \nzombie caricature of oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s former existence, drained of everything that gives \nlife joy and meaning.\n\nTherefore, BODY SNATCHERS remains a classic, even a masterpiece. Too often we \nhear older films praised for being made with low budgets in the days before \ncomputer-generated imagery and graphic special effects, but BODY SNATCHERS is an \nexample where the praise rings true. Don SiegelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s resources may have been \nlimited, but he managed to direct a film that works emotionally and dramatically \non its own terms, so that there is never a moment on screen that makes you \nthink, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIf only they had a little more moneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s portrait of human beings gradually assimilated by an alien invasion \nof emotionless duplicates creates a profoundly disturbing sense of paranoia that \nseems somehow rooted in reality. Despite lip service to the science-fiction \ngenre (a few dialogue references to seeds from outer space), this is a great \npiece of film noir that plays out like a Kafkaesque nightmare or a TWILIGHT ZONE \nepisode expanded to feature length. Even today, frightened viewers cannot be \nblamed if, after seeing the film, they feel an irrational urge to check under \ntheir beds and in their closets, making sure no pods are waiting to snatch them.\n\nTRIVIA\n\nThe highway the leads out of Santa Mira in the film was actually shot at an \noverpass where the Hollywood Freeway heads north through the Hollywood Hills, \njust past the Hollywood Bowl, on the way to Universal Studios.\n\nDespite being considered a classic, the film has an obvious plot hole: When \nMiles (Kevin McCarthy) returns from leaving Becky (Dana Wynter) alone in a mine \nshaft, he kisses her and realizes she has been ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsnatchedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (i.e., she is now a \npod-person duplicate, not the original) The problem is that no alien ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ was \nnearby from which the duplicate could grow, and even if one was hidden out of \nsight in the mine somewhere, there was not enough time for the pod-duplicate to \ndestroy the original BeckyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s body and put on her clothes. Of course, \nthematically, none of this matters: the mechanics of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbody-snatchingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are not \nimportant; the film derives its horror from the fear of losing oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s identity \nand turning into an emotionless pod-person, however that is accomplished. (The \n1978 remake worked harder to justify this scene on a narrative level, showing \nBeckyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s body disintegrate while the duplicate version appeared nearby, naked.)\n\nAccording to the Internet Movie Database, the unwanted prologue and epilogue \nwere removed from the film in 1979, yet the prints available for revival houses \nand film schools around this time continued to include these scenes, as does the \nDVD and the 35mm print struck for a tribute screening at the Academy of Motion \nPicture Arts and SciencesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ tribute to Don Siegel in 2005.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 PLEASE NOTICE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCheck you have installed the right codecs, as listed in this .nfo file, before\ntrying to play it.
