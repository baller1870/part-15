Slo Bid Bellwave\n\nIt's a cliche that electronic music is by definition lacking in warmth and humanity, but judging from the present endless stream of glitched up abstraction flowing from the hard drives of Powerbooks all over the world, it's one that holds a fair amount of water.There's still the oddrecord that bucks the trend though, and this second album from Casino versus Japan (aka Milwaukee based Erik Kowalski) is one such gem.\n\nKowalski's approach is lo-fi, organic; shrouding billowing synth arppegios with clouds of reverb and layering lush sustained chords over dirty analogue machine beats, his mournful, low key electronica offers a welcome alternative to microscopic sonic manipulation and squeaky clean digital noises. His reference points are at once familiar but hard to pin down; Brian Eno, early Kraftwerk and even Gary Numan are hinted at, along with (on the sublime 'Making Lake Park in the Sun') the queasy throb of My Bloody Valentine at their most atmospheric.\n\nPLEASE SEED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e3ddab10a1a37a1e196da97b602c330e34b43fb","amp;dn":"casino+versus+japan+-+whole+numbers+play+the+basics+%282001%29+%5B320k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e3ddab10a1a37a1e196da97b602c330e34b43fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,61,218,177,10,26,55,161,225,150,218,151,182,2,195,48,227,75,67,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
