Who was the mysterious stranger who brought one to a remote village in the Hindu Kush, populated by those who are said to be descended from Alexander the Great? And why does Urkaz Grope want the legendary Trembling Sword of Tybalt Stone at all costs?\n\nThe Rainbow Orchid is traditional adventure at its best. Strong and accessible storytelling with an involving plot and attractive, cinematic artwork, it enjoys a varied international readership of all ages and both sexes.\n\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3426fd5013f1e48b473723c85f3348a728b574bc","amp;dn":"The+Rainbow+Orchid+%282012%29+cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3426fd5013f1e48b473723c85f3348a728b574bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,38,253,80,19,241,228,139,71,55,35,200,95,51,72,167,40,181,116,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
