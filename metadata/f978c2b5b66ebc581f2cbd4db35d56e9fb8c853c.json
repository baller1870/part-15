Sleep, My Little Lord Jesus  \n\n\nBorn: Ernest Jennings Ford on February 13, 1919 in Bristol, TN \nDied October 17, 1991 in Reston, VA\n\nAllmusic Review:\nTennessee Ernie Ford has quite a few Christmas collections on the market, but Fuel 2000's The Best of Christmas is the definitive one. Across 16 tracks, Ford lets his iron-jawed baritone frolic among choirs of angelic background singers, heavenly strings, and gently parping horns. Included are many holiday nuggets like &quot;Silent Night,&quot; &quot;The Little Drummer Boy,&quot; &quot;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,&quot; and &quot;Joy to the World,&quot; done very faithfully and close to the vest. You may need to look elsewhere if you are looking for a Christmas record to bowl you over with high spirits and good cheer, but if you want a four-squared traditional holiday record suitable for everyone from 90-year-old great grandmas to babes wrapped in swaddling, look no further.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f978c2b5b66ebc581f2cbd4db35d56e9fb8c853c","amp;dn":"Tennessee+Ernie+Ford+-+The+Best+of+Christmas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f978c2b5b66ebc581f2cbd4db35d56e9fb8c853c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,120,194,181,182,110,188,88,31,44,189,77,179,93,86,233,251,140,133,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
