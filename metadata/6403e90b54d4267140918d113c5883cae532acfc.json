Since then La bohÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨me  has become part of the standard Italian opera repertory and is one of the most frequently performed operas internationally. According to Opera America, it is the second most frequently performed opera in the United States,[3] just behind another Puccini opera, Madama Butterfly. In 1946, fifty years after the opera's premiere, Toscanini conducted a performance of it on radio with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. This performance was eventually released on records and on Compact Disc. It is the only recording of a Puccini opera by its original conductor (see Recordings below).\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_boh%C3%A8me&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_boh%C3%A8me&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 02:02:39\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 720x480 1.50:1\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 769 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,09 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6403e90b54d4267140918d113c5883cae532acfc","amp;dn":"La+Boh%C3%A8me+-+Puccini+%281977%29+Renata+Scotto%2C+Luciano+Pavarotti%2CMetr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6403e90b54d4267140918d113c5883cae532acfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,3,233,11,84,212,38,113,64,145,141,17,60,88,131,202,229,50,172,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
