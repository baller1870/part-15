The sound quality is far superior to the usual audience recordings. Ask your local dealer for samples! \n\n The general wisdom about the January / February 1973 engagement is that Elvis was depressed about returning to Las Vegas following the great high of Ã¢â‚¬ËœAloha From HawaiiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. In a way itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interesting that this viewpoint has become so widely accepted, because there is precious little evidence for it. Elvis did have to cancel a few shows due to a nasty throat infection, but most people that work in the music business will tell you that these things happen. Elvis had similar problems during the January / February 1970 engagement, which is widely regarded as one of his best.\n\n The unreleased booth tape recordings as featured on this release provide us with an interesting insight into this engagement. Both complete tapes are quite crisp, really fresh-sounding and dynamic, and they are an excellent representation of the two shows that he performed in Vegas on February 22, 1973.\n\n Granted, he is not firing on all cylinders, possibly due to his throat infection, but other than that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s singing well and the shows themselves have a lovely feel to them, warm and very personal. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been said that Ã¢â‚¬ËœIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m LeavinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was one of his favourites, and indeed he performs it brilliantly here, 3 times, bringing life to the world-weary lyrics.\n\n As a bonus, Audionics added a part of the February 21 Dinner Show. There were some audio problems on some of the tracks, so they decided to just include the best parts of the show as an extra on this release.\n\n Note: The February 22, 1973 M/S was released (by the Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ShowroomÃ¢â‚¬Å“ label, Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Back In The DesertÃ¢â‚¬Å“ CD, 2012) from an inferior audience recorded source. This CD has nothing to do with Straight ArrowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å¾booth tapeÃ¢â‚¬Å“ version. Unfortunately, the person who recorded Feb. 22, 1973 M/S stopped his recorder during Jackie KahaneÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs pre-program and switched it on only near the end of Ã¢â‚¬Å¾C. C. Rider.Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Instead of splicing the Ã¢â‚¬Å¾booth tapeÃ¢â‚¬Å“ with the substandard audience recorded version of the same show, Audionics decided to use beginning of February 21, 1973 Dinner Show to fill the missing part.\n \nEnjoy!\nThanks to the original uploader!\njeroep","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:970f0c005b51a323eaec6b1d1a1083b5000daa76","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+Living+from+day+to+day....%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"970f0c005b51a323eaec6b1d1a1083b5000daa76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,15,12,0,91,81,163,35,234,236,107,29,26,16,131,181,0,13,170,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
