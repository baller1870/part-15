Developments in electronics technology have offered new and        \n   enhanced applications, especially in the areas of data recording and      \n   analysis and imaging technology. These changes have been accompanied by   \n   more stringent legislation on safety and liability. This book is          \n   designed to meet the needs of students on the growing number of           \n   courses, undergraduate and MSc. It is a concise and accessible            \n   introduction offering a broad overview that encompasses the various       \n   contributing disciplines.                                                 \n\n  +-[ ALEXANDRIA ]----------------------------------------------------------+\n  : The Royal Library of Alexandria, or Ancient Library of Alexandria, in   :\n  : Alexandria, Egypt, was the largest and most significant great library   :\n  : of the ancient world.
