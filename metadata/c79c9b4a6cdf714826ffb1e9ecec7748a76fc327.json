Now there's a comprehensive answerbook that telecommunications professionals can turn to for problem-solving guidelines to make their company's telephone services reliable and trouble-free. This book, developed at Bellcore, presents analysis and techniques and methodlogies for upgrading the reliability of digital switching systems (DSS) and teaching (DSS) and teaching DSS architectures, internal communications, and controls as it covers the newest switches and technologies such as SS7 and ATM.\nKey Features:\n\nFull Coverage of all digital switching system fundamentals and architectural issues.\n\nadvanced Markov models and the use of sensitivity analysis to help assses digital switching system reliability state-of-the-art analysis of telephony traffic signal transfer points(STPs)Detailed description of digital switching system software and quality analysis techniques.Digital Switching system maintenance, and analysis of networked switching systems.\nAbout the Author:\n\nSyed R. Ali is currently a Senior Engineer in the Integration and Implementation organization at Bellcore (Piscataway, NJ), and has over 27 years experience in telephone engineering and digital switching system analysis.
