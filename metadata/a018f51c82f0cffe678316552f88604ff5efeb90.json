It marked a farewell to an older generation of acolytes and fellow travellers. Miles was entering a new era of leadership and international stardom, and generally he would only record with his working groups.\n\nQUINTET/SEXTET is notable for two compositions by Jackie McLean: &quot; Dr. Jackle &quot; and &quot; Minor March &quot; ( it appears on his famous 1959 Blue Note date NEW SOIL as &quot; Minor Apprehension &quot; ). The former is a Charlie Parker-ish line featuring a masterful Milt Jackson symposium on the blues--Miles' typically lyric approach, a tart, spacious flight from McLean, and a soulful, dancing Ray Bryant. The latter is a mysterious minor figure with jabbing rhythm breaks and a joyous bridge that recalls &quot; Tempus Fugit. &quot; McLean's vaulting cadences and fervent cry anticipate the rapture of his mature style, and Bryant takes a harmonically adventuresome solo.\n\nElsewhere the group digs into the Bud Powell-like changes of Ray Bryant's low, slow &quot; Changes &quot; ( over the rock solid groove of Percy Heath and Art Taylor ), and the quirky harmonies and angular melodies of Thad Jones' &quot; Bitty Ditty. &quot; &quot; Changes &quot; inspires a lovely muted statement from Davis, and illustrates Bryant's unique blend of blues, sanctified gospel and bebop. Davis and Jackson combine for pungent voicings on the head to &quot; Bitty Ditty, &quot; then demonstrate their elegant mastery of harmony and swing. Both are inspired by the shape of Jones' line, completely unfazed by its intricacies.\n\nPersonnel:\nMiles Davis ( trumpet )\nMilt Jackson ( vibraphone )\nJackie McLean ( alto saxophone )\nRay Bryant ( piano ) \nPercy Heath ( bass ) \nArt Taylor ( drums )\n\nMiles Davis &amp; Milt Jackson - Quintet &amp; Sextet Tracks:\n01  Dr.Jackle 8.47\n02  Bitty Ditty 6.31\n03  Minor March 8.12\n04  Changes 7.08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a018f51c82f0cffe678316552f88604ff5efeb90","amp;dn":"Miles+Davis+%26+Milt+Jackson+-+Quintet+%26+Sextet+%281955%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a018f51c82f0cffe678316552f88604ff5efeb90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,24,245,28,130,240,207,254,103,131,22,85,47,136,96,79,245,239,235,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
