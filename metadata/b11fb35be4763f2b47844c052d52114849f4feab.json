Elsa Lanchester plays a fun supporting role, along with the sleazy George Macready.\n\nI like the line from Laughton to his mistress, that at least her latest tryst &quot;wore a clean shirt&quot;.\n\nI prefer noirs that don't try to include comedy. The weakest moments and characters of this movie are when it tries to be funny. Admittedly, Maureen O'Sullivan gives those moments a run for their money with her caricature pouting of an abandoned wife. It all hangs together though, if only barely.\n\n\n*******\n\nPlease seed at least 1:1, a bit more if you can. Thank you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b11fb35be4763f2b47844c052d52114849f4feab","amp;dn":"The+Big+Clock+%281948+film+noir%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b11fb35be4763f2b47844c052d52114849f4feab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,31,179,91,228,118,63,43,71,132,76,5,45,82,17,72,73,244,254,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
