It was released as a double album, the first disc containing studio material, and the second containing live recordings. It reached No. 12 in the UK charts. In 1989, Virgin re-released the album, with the same track listing, in CD format. It is the first album to feature Janick Gers, since Bernie TormÃƒÂ© left the group during the tour of Germany in 1981. In fact TormÃƒÂ© was fired because he did not want to participate in the playback TV performance of &quot;No Laughing in Heaven&quot; at &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 24 June 1981. Janick Gers came in for the rest of the tour on 25 June 1981.\n\nIn 2007, Edsel released this album with bonus material.\n\n2007 Re-release\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nDisc One: Studio\n\n    &quot;I'll Rip Your Spine Out&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (4.30) (Gillan/McCoy/Underwood)\n    &quot;Restless&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (3.19)\n    &quot;Men Of War&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (4.31)\n    &quot;Sunbeam&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (4.11) (Gillan/Gers/McCoy/Underwood)\n    &quot;Nightmare&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (3.15) (Towns)\n    &quot;Hadely Bop Bop&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (2.50)\n    &quot;Life Goes On&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (5.12) (Gillan/Towns)\n    &quot;Born To Kill&quot; (9.28) (Gillan/Towns)\n    &quot;Spanish Guitar (Bonus Track)&quot; (3.24) (Gillan/Towns)\n\nDisc Two: Live\n\n    &quot;No Laughing In Heaven&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (6.26) (Gillan/McCoy/TormÃƒÂ©/Underwood)\n    &quot;No Easy Way&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (10.32) (Gillan/McCoy/TormÃƒÂ©)\n    &quot;Trouble&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (3.04) (Leiber/Stoller)\n    &quot;Mutually Assured Destruction&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (5.13) \n    &quot;If You Believe Me&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (8.26) (Gillan/McCoy/TormÃƒÂ©/Underwood)*\n    &quot;New Orleans&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (5.54) (Guida/Royster)\n    &quot;Bite The Bullet&quot; (Bonus Track) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (5.20) (Gillan/Towns)\n    &quot;On The Rocks&quot; (Bonus Track) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (6.32) (Gillan/Towns)\n    &quot;Mr Universe&quot; (Bonus Track) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (7.13) (Gillan/Towns)**\n    &quot;Vengeance&quot; (Bonus Track) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (4.26) (Gillan/Towns)**\n    &quot;Smoke On The Water&quot; (Bonus Track) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (8.55) \n\nLive tracks recorded at Reading Festival on 29 August 1981.\n\n* Recorded at the Rainbow Theatre on 4 March 1981.\n\n** Recorded at the Reading Festival 22 August 1980.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64e1bdf6bc16c16c5abcdebe5f68525bae788576","amp;dn":"Gillan+-+Double+Trouble+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64e1bdf6bc16c16c5abcdebe5f68525bae788576","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,225,189,246,188,22,193,108,90,188,222,190,95,104,82,91,174,120,133,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
