The band has gone through several phases, but its strongest commercial success came in the late 1970s to the early 1980s. During this period, they had hits with a series of power ballads and rock songs, including &quot;Don't Stop Believin'&quot;, &quot;Any Way You Want It&quot;, &quot;Faithfully&quot;, &quot;Open Arms&quot;, &quot;Send Her My Love&quot; &quot;Separate Ways&quot;, &quot;Wheel in the Sky&quot;, &quot;Who's Crying Now&quot;, &quot;Stone In Love&quot;, &quot;Lovin,' Touchin,' Squeezin;'&quot;, and &quot;Lights&quot;. The group enjoyed a successful reunion in the mid-1990s with a major Grammy-nominated hit, &quot;When You Love a Woman.&quot; Throughout Journey's three decades of existence, their albums have achieved gold status twice, platinum status three times, multi-platinum plateau eight times, and Diamond one time. These include seven consecutive multi-platinum albums, stretching from 1978 to 1987. They had 18 Top 40 singles, six of which reached the Top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Their signature song, &quot;Don't Stop Believin'&quot;, is the top-selling catalog track in iTunes history, at more than two million downloads.[1][2]\n\nAccording to the Recording Industry Association of America, Journey has sold 47 million albums in the United States, making them the 28th best selling band. Their worldwide sales have reached 80 million albums. A USA Today opinion poll in 2005 asked respondents to weigh in on who they thought was the best American rock band in history; Journey came in fifth place.[3][4]\n\nJourney has been eligible for induction into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame since 2000, but Gregg Rolie is the only current or former member of Journey who has been inducted ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ as a member of parent band Santana. Steve Perry, the band's best-known lead vocalist, is eligible for induction as a solo artist as of 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreatest Hits  1988\n\n\nGreatest Hits is the first compilation album by the American rock band Journey, released on November 15, 1988.
