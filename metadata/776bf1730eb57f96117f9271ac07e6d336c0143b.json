I have (tried) to modify them for it to work on Mountain Lion (Build 12E55 ONLY). Now, I'm not exactly sure if these will work or not. Unfortunately, my mac is the only mac I have with me at the moment. Let me know in the comments if it works, and if it doesn't, I will take the torrent down.\n\n\nInstructions:\nIncluded in the zip.\n\nThis is my second attempt to make them work.
