And he reaches deep into his own experienceÃ¢â‚¬â€from disturbing waking dreams, to his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s struggles with dementia, to his own epic 129-hour bout of insomniaÃ¢â‚¬â€to reveal the effect of sleeplessness on his imaginative landscape.\n\nThe result is an exhilarating exploration of dream and awareness, desperation and relief, consciousness and conscienceÃ¢â‚¬â€a fascinating maze-map of the borders between sleep and the waking world by one of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most talked-about writers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e5d1cd86cee1c7bf4e9967e534f7735983a5538","amp;dn":"Nothing+-+A+Portrait+of+Insomnia+%5BQwerty80%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e5d1cd86cee1c7bf4e9967e534f7735983a5538","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,93,28,216,108,238,28,123,244,233,150,126,83,79,119,53,152,58,85,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
