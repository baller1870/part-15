S. Lewis and known to his friends and family as &quot;Jack&quot;, was a novelist, poet, academic, medievalist, literary critic, essayist, lay theologian, and Christian apologist from Belfast, Ireland. He held academic positions at both Oxford University (Magdalen College), 1925Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1954, and Cambridge University (Magdalene College), 1954Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1963. He is best known both for his fictional work, especially The Screwtape Letters, The Chronicles of Narnia, and The Space Trilogy, and for his non-fiction Christian apologetics, such as Mere Christianity, Miracles, and The Problem of Pain.\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia:\n1. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1950)\n2. Prince Caspian (1951)\n3. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (1952)\n4. The Silver Chair (1953)\n5. The Horse and his Boy (1954)\n6. The Magician's Nephew (1955)\n7. The Last Battle (1956)\n\nNote: When I ran this through Calibre the metadata ordered the books in chronological versus the published order you see listed. Now this doesn't affect anything, its just that HarperCollins (his publisher) in updating the formatting and covers, has listed them (including putting THEIR ordering on the covers) in the setting that they happen, which means The Magician's Nephew is the first book in the series. I'm a Traditionalist but I did put the series ordering as offered by Calibre. All you have to do is open Calibre and adjust and then reconvert to ePub or Mobi, which ever is your preference\n\nFull Retail ePub. Calibre Ready.
