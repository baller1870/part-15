Communication Breakdown\r\n\r\nWhite Summer/Black Mountain Side was played, but not captured on the master reel.\r\n\r\nComments: \r\nThis show is just blistering. The first set has the group firing on all cylinders and playing their hearts out. The second set is more bluesy and laid back, but that never means less enjoyable. The only live version of Sittin' and Thinkin', a Buddy Guy number, is here and the completely different song list for each set make this a great show to have. Dazed And Confused is really dark here. The group's excitement to be so anticipated by Californian audience found their way in Plant ad-libbed lyrics of I Can't Quit You Baby: &quot;I'm so glad you came tonight ... but I think we're gonna leave this town for a little while ... I don't want to leave you people ... but I think we've got to leave San Francisco for a little while&quot;. Also some member of the audience is calling for You Shook Me, what makes a quick and quite funny response from Plant: &quot;Right! Don't worry by that! Just one before that!&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:893cdcb8b239b704100fea0cbd9f5364bf65ae79","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1969.04.27+San+Francisco%2C+Fillmore+West+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"893cdcb8b239b704100fea0cbd9f5364bf65ae79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,60,220,184,178,57,183,4,16,15,234,12,189,159,83,100,191,101,174,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
