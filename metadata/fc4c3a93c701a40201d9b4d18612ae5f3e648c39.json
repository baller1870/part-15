This time the producers have chosen two excellent performances from Sunday, February 3, 1974 at the Las Vegas Hilton.\n On this collection there are worthy performances of revived songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“TryinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ To Get To YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sweet CarolineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and a powerful Ã¢â‚¬Å“Polk Salad AnnieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, The December Ã¢â‚¬â„¢73 Stax sessions are represented here with pleasant renditions of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Spanish EyesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Help MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Ã¢â‚¬Å“An American TrilogyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is as powerful as ever and Elvis' passion for Olivia Newton-JohnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Let Me Be ThereÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is evident too, with the ending being reprised in both shows.\n As fans have come to expect from us, the tapes are of very good quality, sourced from early generation copies of the original cassettes. The double digipak contains liner notes and is filled with photos from the Montgomery, AL, March 6th, 1974 show, due to a lack of quality images from PresleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s January-February 1974 engagement.\n As usual, these recordings have been carefully engineered to be presented in the best possible sound. \n \nEnjoy!\nThanks to the original uploader!\nJeroep","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc4c3a93c701a40201d9b4d18612ae5f3e648c39","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+With+a+humble+heart+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc4c3a93c701a40201d9b4d18612ae5f3e648c39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,76,58,147,199,1,164,2,1,217,180,209,134,18,174,95,62,100,140,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
