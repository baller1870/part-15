He was designed by Chris Burnham, but was first drawn by Yanick Paquette.\n\nBatwing has since gained his own monthly ongoing series as part of the 2011 DC Universe reboot, featuring art by Ben Oliver and written by Power Girl and Justice League: Generation Lost writer Judd Winick.\n\nAccording to fellow Batman Incorporated artists, Chris Burnham told iFanboy that he designed the character first, while Paquette was the first to draw him in interiors. In line with Morrison's use of obscure continuity throughout his Batman stories, the character seems to be based visually on a minor character which appeared in Batman #250 in a story called &quot;The Batman Nobody Knows&quot;. In this story, a young African-American boy tells his friends how he imagines Batman to be, and gives him the name &quot;Batwings&quot;.\n\nWriting duo Justin Gray and Jimmy Palmiotti took over the book starting with Batwing #19 (June 2013), to introduce a new Batwing, Luke Fox, unrelated to the previous one. The new Batwing character would no longer be the &quot;Batman of Africa&quot;, but be more international, along with having more ties to Gotham City.[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks goes to the ShiningKnight for this release.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dc07f92f1266c6e05ea39486d1452144fd54892","amp;dn":"Batwing+01-33%282013%29+%28Digital%29+%28Shining+Knight-SCC-Novus%29+%5BNVS-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dc07f92f1266c6e05ea39486d1452144fd54892","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,192,127,146,241,38,108,110,5,234,57,72,109,20,82,20,79,213,72,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
