Does amaranth flour sound fascinating but perhaps a little too froufrou? Do you love the chocolate cherry scones at your local coffee shop, but feel way too scared to attempt them on your own?\n\n\n Fears begone! You are now in the safe albeit floury hands of Celine Steen and Tamasin Noyes, two vegan ladies who know their way around the oven-and barley and buckwheat flour too. \n\nExpect to see not an ounce of white flour, refined white sugar, or powdered egg replacer in this book. \n\nInstead, indulge in wholesome breads, muffins, pies, pancakes, and other treats that draw on the nutty depth of flavor and enhanced taste of ingredients like whole grain flours and natural sweeteners.\n\nCeline Steen is the co-author of Vegan Sandwiches Save the Day!, 500 Vegan Recipes, The Complete Guide to Vegan Food Substitutions, and Hearty Vegan Meals. She is the founder of the blog Have Cake, Will Travel (havecakewilltravel.com). She lives in California.\nTamasin Noyes, a long time vegan, grew up in a meat- and-potatoes family. After years of cookbook testing, Tami was honored to become an author herself. With Celine Steen, Tami has written Vegan Sandwiches Save the Day! and the Whole Grain Vegan Baking Book. Tami's solo works include American Vegan Kitchen  and Grills Gone Vegan.
