It recounts the adventures of three African-American men who escape from prison and are later gathered up. In between, an animated tale has animal characters with stereotypically black traits -- Brother Rabbit (voiced by Thomas), Brother Fox (voiced by Gordone), and Brother Bear (voiced by White) -- entering a white-dominated ghetto environment and diverging into different paths; one becomes a crime overlord, the second sells the first out to La Cosa Nostra, and the third establishes himself as a media-exploited sports icon. Completely misread as a racist work upon release, the film actually entails Bakshi's satirical excoriation of bigotry via the tongue-in-cheek use of black urban stereotypes. The director laces the film with profane ghetto dialogue and street slang; though animated, this is not a picture for children.\n\nFormat: NTSC\nDVD Size: 4.19 Gb -- Exact Untouched Copy\nRuntime (main feature): 82 minutes\nType: Color\nAspect Ratio: 1.85:1 | Anamorphic\nSound (main feature): English DD2.0\nSubtitles: none\n\nDisc Features\n----------------\n# none.\n\nPosted in:\na.b.dvd.classics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9637a0544ea980a62cdb34a7319633b8e54e6329","amp;dn":"Ralph.Bakshi.Coonskin.1975.DVDR.NTSC.DVD5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9637a0544ea980a62cdb34a7319633b8e54e6329","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,55,160,84,78,169,128,166,44,219,52,167,49,150,51,184,229,78,99,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
