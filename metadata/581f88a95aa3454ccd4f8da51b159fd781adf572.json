Following 2008's The Bedlam In Goliath-its third consecutive album to debut Top 10-which featured Wax Simulacra, Grammy winner for Best Hard Rock Performance, The Mars Volta's punkperverted neo-psychedelia goes acoustic on Octahedron. Says the band's Cedric Bixler Zavala: There's electricity throughout it! But that's what our band does-celebrate mutations.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:581f88a95aa3454ccd4f8da51b159fd781adf572","amp;dn":"The+Mars+Volta+-+Octahedron+%5Bmp3-vbr-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"581f88a95aa3454ccd4f8da51b159fd781adf572","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,31,136,169,90,163,69,76,205,79,141,165,27,21,159,215,129,173,245,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
