Earthquakes. Pandemics. Global economic crises. Terrorism. Whether natural or man-made, massive catastrophes happen far more often than decision-makers once imagined. Organizations must prepare for these eventsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“but how? In Learning from Catastrophes, the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s leading experts in extreme risk management present innovative approaches to mitigation, preparedness, and response. They show how to dramatically improve forecasting and communication about high-consequence risks, use economic incentives to improve resilience and sustainability, and proactively implement operational steps for rapid, effective response to disaster. In todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s increasingly unstable, uncertain world, preparing for extreme risk has never been more urgent. Whether youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re a leader in the private, public, or nonprofit sector, this book presents the principles and strategies youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll need.\n\nFrom the Back Cover\n\nEvents ranging from Hurricane Katrina to the global economic crisis have taught businesspeople an unforgettable lesson: if you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t plan for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œextreme risk,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ you endanger your organizationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s very survival. But how can you plan for events that go far beyond anything that occurs in normal day-to-day business? In Learning from Catastrophes, two renowned experts present the first comprehensive strategic framework for assessing, responding to, and managing extreme risk. Howard Kunreuther and Michael Useem build on their own breakthrough work on mitigating natural disasters, extending it to the challenges faced by real-world enterprises.\n\nAlong with the contributions of leading experts in risk management, heuristics, and disaster recovery, they identify the behavioral biases and faulty heuristics that mislead decision makers about the likelihood of catastrophe. They go on to identify the hidden links associated with extreme risks, and present techniques for systematically building greater resilience into the organization. The global best-seller The Black Swan told executives that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œonce in a lifetimeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ events are far more common and dangerous than they ever realized. Learning from Catastrophe shows them exactly what to do about it.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nHoward Kunreuther is the Cecilia Yen Koo Professor of Decision Sciences and Public Policy at the Wharton School, and Co-Director of the Wharton Risk Management and Decision Processes Center.
