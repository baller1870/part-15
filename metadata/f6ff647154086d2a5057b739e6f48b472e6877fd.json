Much of the credit is due to producer Jerry Wexler, who finally unleashed the soulful intensity so long kept under wraps during her Columbia tenure; assembling a crack Muscle Shoals backing band along with an abundance of impeccable material, Wexler creates the ideal setting to allow Aretha to ascend to the throne of Queen of Soul, and she responds with the strongest performances of her career. While the brilliant title track remains the album's other best-known song, each cut on I Never Loved a Man is touched by greatness; covers of Ray Charles' &quot;Drown in My Own Tears&quot; and Sam Cooke's &quot;Good Times&quot; and &quot;A Change Is Gonna Come&quot; are on par with the original recordings, while Aretha's own contributions -- &quot;Don't Let Me Lose This Dream,&quot; &quot;Baby, Baby, Baby,&quot; &quot;Save Me,&quot; and &quot;Dr. Feelgood (Love Is a Serious Business)&quot; -- are perfectly at home in such lofty company. A soul landmark.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6ff647154086d2a5057b739e6f48b472e6877fd","amp;dn":"Aretha+Franklin+-+I+Never+Loved+A+Man+The+Way+I+Love+You+%5BFLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6ff647154086d2a5057b739e6f48b472e6877fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,255,100,113,84,8,109,42,80,87,183,57,230,244,139,71,46,104,119,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
