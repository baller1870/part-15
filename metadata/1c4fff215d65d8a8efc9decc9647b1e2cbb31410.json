Alternating older material with his recent originals (some of which sound more traditional than the vintage songs), Davis plays straight-ahead blues, country blues, a couple songs that could be called bluish pop, folk music, and blues ballads. Davis' baritone singing is pleasing, his guitar is solid, and his band is tight yet versatile. It is Davis' goal to keep the legacy of the blues alive, and this CD should help the worthy effort. ~ Scott Yanow\n\nTracklist\n1. Uncle Tom's Dead 4:47\n2. Pay Day 3:16\n3. Run Molly Run 3:30\n4.
