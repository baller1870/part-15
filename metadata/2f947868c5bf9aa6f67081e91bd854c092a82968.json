The story unfolds around Richard, a homicidal Undead Warlock, and Cale'anon a naive hippyesque elf who wants to better the world. The humor is pretty dark at times but the comic is pretty damn addictive. Since its launch on November 26, 2006 (witch was exactly my 18th birthday), it has received positive attention at the Dungeons &amp; Dragons and the World of Warcraft community.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looking_For_Group&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looking_For_Group&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGo to YouTube and type in &quot;Slaughter The World&quot; and you will see the awesome Looking for Group music video performed by Richard, the homicidal Undead Warlock :)\n\n\nAT LEAST UPLOAD THE SAME AMOUNT YOU DOWNLOADED PLEASE!!!
