This question is now being experimentally tested. This course, offered by the UK Centre for Astrobiology at the University of Edinburgh, is an introduction to astrobiology and was the first MOOC to explore this subject. It explores the origin and evolution of life on the Earth and its potential to exist elsewhere.\n\nAstrobiology addresses compelling questions of wide interest such as: How did life originate on the Earth? Is this an inevitable process and is life common across the Universe? Astrobiology is an interdisciplinary science that bridges fields as diverse as astrophysics, biology, geosciences and chemistry.\n\nIn this course we will explore what we know about life&lt;92&gt;s ability to live in extreme environments on the Earth, we will look at different hypotheses for how it originated. We will look at some of the missions to search for life in our own Solar System and on planets orbiting distant stars. We will discuss some of the extreme environments on the Earth that help us understand the limits of life and how life has adapted to cope with extremes. We will explore the possibility of intelligent alien life and some of the implications of its detection. The course will provide a foundation in astrobiology and introduce students to concepts in a diversity of scientific fields. \n\nMore information about this course available at https://www.coursera.org/course/astrobio\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:543d0d0bdb209a09b6ad00267bd7d54cac333835","amp;dn":"%5BCoursera%5D+Astrobiology+and+the+Search+for+Extraterrestrial+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"543d0d0bdb209a09b6ad00267bd7d54cac333835","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,61,13,11,219,32,154,9,182,173,0,38,123,215,213,76,172,51,56,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
