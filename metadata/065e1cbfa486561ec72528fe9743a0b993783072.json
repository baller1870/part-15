But life was to take Viktor far from the peace &amp; solitude of the great mountains and forests. Instead he was to lead the struggle to preserve the Earth, the forests and rivers; attacking the exploitation of nature, as early as the 1920s. Nature was his teacher - Through an understanding of nature&amp;#039;s principles, seen in the flowing motion of water, he gave the world a vision of how technology could be transformed to render free, non-polluting energy for our use. He warned of the consequences, facing humanity, if the present death-oriented technology continued! He died, betrayed by the same powers who promised to make his dreams a reality - commercial gangsters, who TAKE ALL and give NOTHING in return! \n\n--\n\ngo and get these books after this:\ncallum coats: living energies\nbrian desborough: a blueprint for a better world (tesla, schauberger, moray, gray, bedini, bearden, survival gardening, lloyd zirbes atomic vortex theory.. great book)\nalick bartholomew: hidden nature\ncallum coats: eco-technology-1: water wizard\ncallum coats: eco-technology-2: nature as teacher\ncallum coats: eco-technology-3: fertile earth\ncallum coats: eco-technology-4: energy evolution\nolof alexandersson: living water\nalick bartholomew: schauberger keys\n\nand other books\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:065e1cbfa486561ec72528fe9743a0b993783072","amp;dn":"Nature+Was+My+Teacher+-+Viktor+Schauberger+-+water%2C+vortex%2C+impl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"065e1cbfa486561ec72528fe9743a0b993783072","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,94,28,191,164,134,86,30,199,37,40,254,151,67,160,185,147,120,48,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
