Not quite as disturbing as the chapter itself. In fact, with this treatment, one would wonder why it wasn't in the film.\n\nWith Alan Cumming (without his Scots accent).\n\nnot the greatest rip (not the worst) just the only one that seems to be available.\n\nThe full 20 minutes.\n\nFrom IMdB:\n\nWhile Davie (Alan Cumming) befriends Alan Venters (Jim Shield), the serial rapist responsible for his girlfriend's HIV related death and his own infection; he struggles to find the perfect means of revenge. Davie soon learns that Venters' only weakness is an imagined connection to his long-estranged six-year old son, Kevin (Josh Ballard). With time running out, Davie pursues a relationship with the Mother (Claudette Mink), but only to use the innocent child as the means to send the remorseless Venters to a horrifying demise.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b13d9bc8839ed9331c70865224983306dba355bd","amp;dn":"Irvine+Welsh%2FKyle+Leydier+-+Bad+Blood+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b13d9bc8839ed9331c70865224983306dba355bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,61,155,200,131,158,217,51,28,112,134,82,36,152,51,6,219,163,85,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
