If you have, for example, let's take it three rings, and you join two of the same color, you won't have match for the third one, so you won't be able to finish the level, unless you undo your move. Arrows on the table buttons shows in which direction(s) will rings be moved one square, and that's basically how you move the rings. Every level is accompanied by a very nice tune, and there are different settings for expert players, or for the beginners. The game also includes its easy to use editor for the levels.\n\n- An Action game you need to PLAY\n- Contain full Lemegeton Episode 1 features\n\nPLUS!!\n- Lemegeton Episode 2 New Content\n- Two playable characters\n- 7 Areas to Explore\n- Over 30 Demons\n- Over 30 Skills\n- Plenty of Weapons and Upgrade\n- New Storyline\n- and More\n\nOnly in Master Edition\n- Playable character Dawn unlocked by default\n- Readjusted gameplay experience FOR\n- ONE-TIME payment, NO Inapp-Purchase, NO AD Banner\nPaid it Once and play forever\n- FREE Update\n- Players Comments\n&quot;Like all the people say Just like Castlevania but still stands its ground as a solid new game.&quot;\n&quot;Wow!
