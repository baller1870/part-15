She was the first Australian addition to the Victoria&amp;#039;s Secret campaign, and was the face of Australian fashion chain Portmans and now David Jones Limited. Kerr rose to prominence within the fashion industry in her mid-teens after winning a 1997 Australian nation-wide model search hosted by Dolly Magazine and Impulse fragrances. Kerr&amp;#039;s career has continued to expand, and as of 2008, she has achieved international fame.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdab7d9483326d457bc5a511b195fe28f3a45152","amp;dn":"Miranda+Kerr+Wallpapers+-+Maglor1212","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdab7d9483326d457bc5a511b195fe28f3a45152","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,171,125,148,131,50,109,69,123,197,165,17,177,149,254,40,243,164,81,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
