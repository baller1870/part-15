Knowing a few basic vi commands guarantees you'll be able to work with these systems when no other editor is installed. In this course, David D. Levine shows you how to get in and out of vi, switch modes, and start editing files in place. Learn how to change text within a file, use commands like undo and yank, find and replace text, and invoke more advanced Unix commands. Although it may be arcane, vi is still the standard text editor for all Unix systems. Start learning it now and run your systems more smoothly in the future.\n\n\n\n\nTopics include:\n\n* Entering and leaving vi\n\n* Understanding the Command, Insert, and Colon modes\n\n* Moving around in files\n\n* Editing text\n\n* Moving content with delete, yank, and put\n\n* Searching with regular expressions\n\n* Customizing vi\n\n* Filtering text through shell commands","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7899bffa1ca4710c50f016d0c3d24130f5bad5c","amp;dn":"%5BLynda%5D+Up+and+Running+with+vi+Tutorial-KTR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7899bffa1ca4710c50f016d0c3d24130f5bad5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,137,155,255,161,202,71,16,197,15,1,109,12,61,36,19,15,91,173,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
