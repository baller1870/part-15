But after exhausting all charitable donations, Dessa still needs a loan, and nearly every bank in town has turned her down. Her last hope hinges on the owner of Hawkins National Bank.\n\nHenry Hawkins has a secret: though he owns the most successful bank in town, his initial capital came from three successful raids on Wells Fargo coaches. Now heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the most eligible bachelor in Denver, but to protect his criminal past, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s built a fortress around his heart. Not even the boldest matchmaking mother can tempt him . . . until the day Dessa Caldwell ventures into his bank requesting a loan.\n\nThough heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s certain her proposal is a bad investment, Henry is drawn to DessaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s passion. But that same passion drives her to make rash decisions about Pierson House . . . and about whom she can trust. One man might hold the key to the future of her missionÃ¢â‚¬â€but he also threatens to bring HenryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s darkest secrets to light. As the walls around their hearts begin to crumble, Henry and Dessa must choose between their plans and GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, between safety and love.\n\n\nNote 1: As at 7 June 2014 displays well on desktop computer using Calibre version 1.36 and using version 1.10.8 of the Kindle application.\n\nNote 2: On the Samsung Note 10.1 (2012 model) I can view the epub file with the Aldiko app and the Kindle for android for the mobi file, both in vertical and horizontal layout.\n\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2981dbf28c65ce103df92ac975ee30a0aa4713b7","amp;dn":"All+in+Good+Time+ebook+Maureen+Lang+epub+mobi+Fiction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2981dbf28c65ce103df92ac975ee30a0aa4713b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,129,219,242,140,101,206,16,61,249,42,201,117,238,48,160,170,71,19,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
