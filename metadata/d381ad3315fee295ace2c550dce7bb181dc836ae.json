To say that Emotional Rescue is Some Girls leftovers warmed over is somewhat harsh. Now granted, the two albums have a similar sound, rock with some disco leanings, and Some Girls is a much better album than its successor, but ER isn't an album to be totally dismissed because it pales alongside its parent album. \nFar from it, this was better than expected, although I will make references to songs from Some Girls. \n\n&quot;Dance (Pt. 1)&quot; opens with the funky disco beats that coloured &quot;Miss You&quot;, but with a harder-edged sound-call it Queen's &quot;Another One Bites The Dust&quot; meets Led Zeppelin's &quot;Trampled Underfoot.&quot; A strong opener good for dancing and jamming to. \nThe reggae-flavoured &quot;Send It To Me&quot; seems to be a sequel to &quot;Some Girls.&quot; Where the latter described what different kind of girls were like based on ethnicity and skin colour, the other song is kind of like a dating service. There's some humour at the end, when Mick sings &quot;she could be Romanian, she could be Bulgarian, she could be Albanian, she could be Hungarian, she could be Ukrainian, .... she could be the Alien, send her to me.&quot; OK, Mick, you can have the Alien, I'll take the Romanian girl. \n\nA rumbling guitar opens the rocker &quot;Let Me Go,&quot; which is this album's &quot;Respectable&quot; about a girl who doesn't seem to understand the words, &quot;it's over between us.&quot; &quot;Indian Girl&quot; is this album's &quot;Beast of Burden&quot; with some country inflections and some horns, though with the sober topic, nothing singleworthy. It's a portrait of the hardships inflicted on the indigenous population of Latin America by soldiers: &quot; Lesson number one that you learn while you're young/Life just goes on and on getting harder and harder.&quot; \n\nThe most engaging track is the hard-driving &quot;Where The Boys Go,&quot; which is this album's &quot;Lies&quot; with a chanting harmony refrain. This macho guilty pleasure gets raunchy towards the end, where the refrain goes &quot;a little piece of...&quot; Then it's cooling off time with some slow blues of &quot;Down in The Hole&quot; of hard life in the American zone (of Berlin I presume). \n\nThe title track, which reached #3, is the analogue of &quot;Miss You,&quot; featuring some disco beats and Mick's falsetto, and is arguably one of the two best tracks. The other one, the rocker &quot;She's So Cold,&quot; is this album's &quot;Shattered,&quot; with the same quick-paced drums and drums. &quot;I'm so hot for you and you're so cold,&quot; comparing her to an ice cream cone, and lines of his hand freezing when he touches her are featured in this ice queen song. This bettered &quot;Shattered&quot; by peaking at #26. \n\nEmotional Rescue has been reviled alongside Black And Blue, Undercover, and It's Only Rock And Roll as one of the Stones' weakest albums, but maybe that's because it is repeatedly compared with Some Girls or Tattoo You, the albums it is chronologically sandwiched inbetween. With songs like the two singles, &quot;Dance,&quot; and &quot;Where The Boys Go,&quot; such is not the case. Major reevaluation required.\n\nby Daniel J.
