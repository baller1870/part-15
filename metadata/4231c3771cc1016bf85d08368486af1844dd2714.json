He then moves on to discuss a series of scenarios which might have altered the course of subsequent history dramatically. Would the survival of a strong Western Empire have assisted the Eastern (Byzantine) Empire in halting the expansion of Islam in the Middle East and North Africa? How would the Western Roman Empire have handled the Viking threat? Could they even have exploited the Viking discovery of America and established successful colonies there?\n\nWhile necessarily speculative, all the scenarios are discussed within the framework of a deep understanding of the major driving forces, tensions and trends that shaped European history and help to shed light upon them. In so doing they help the reader to understand why things panned out as they did, as well as what might have been.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4231c3771cc1016bf85d08368486af1844dd2714","amp;dn":"If+Rome+Hadn%27t+Fallen+-+Timothy+Venning.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4231c3771cc1016bf85d08368486af1844dd2714","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,49,195,119,28,193,1,107,248,93,8,54,132,134,175,24,68,221,39,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
