Stalingrad: The Infernal Cauldron is a detailed history of Hitler's great failure, and a comprehensive account of one of the most important battles of World War II. With full-color strategic maps, 170 black and white photographs, over half of which have never before been published, and detailed appendices that contain information on orders of battle, losses, and equipment, Stalingrad is an exhaustive account of the battle that bled the German army dry, and turned the war in the East decisively against the Germans.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3c3bb7c230b69f26621d790389212068018d60a","amp;dn":"Stalingrad_The+infernal+Cauldron+-+Walsh%2C+Steven+%5BNon-Fiction%5D+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3c3bb7c230b69f26621d790389212068018d60a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,195,187,124,35,11,105,242,102,33,215,144,56,146,18,6,128,24,214,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
