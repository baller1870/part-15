His     \n    first recipe is a French classic, brioche, a buttery      \n    bread using eggs that is the easiest of bread recipes.   \n    Using this as a base, he makes a celebratory gateau a     \n    la creme brioche filled with a lemony creme fraiche. To    \n    follow, we get down to basics with a French country       \n    bread recipe essential to any bakers' repertoire, that   \n    is formed into beer-topped rolls, a basket-shaped loaf    \n    and an olive-and-tomato-topped fougasse. To finish,        \n    there's a delicate yet spectacular dessert of apple       \n    croustade made from the thinnest pastry baked until      \n    crisp and golden.                                         \n    Along the way, Raymond visits one of the UK's oldest       \n    flourmills, Shipton Mill in Gloucestershire, to           \n    experiment making bread with gluten-free flour.          \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86654175ce6b5cab120d432d43502a162471b3d2","amp;dn":"Raymond.Blancs.Kitchen.Secrets.S01E06.720p.HDTV.x264-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86654175ce6b5cab120d432d43502a162471b3d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,101,65,117,206,107,92,171,18,13,67,45,67,80,42,22,36,113,179,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
