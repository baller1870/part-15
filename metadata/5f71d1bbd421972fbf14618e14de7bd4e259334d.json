Because being a DJ is more than just pressing play, DJs cannot just use iTunes or Media Player to perform a mix. They need special controls like crossfaders, loops, effects, etc, in order to mix the songs.\r\n\r\nIt is used by DJs to replace their turntables and CD players, and use digital music instead of vinyl and CDs.\r\nIn the same way that the CD players used by DJs have more options than a regular Hi-Fi CD player, VirtualDJ has more options than a simple media player like iTunes. It lets you mix your songs, by playing two or more tracks at the same time, adjust their relative speed so that their tempo will match, apply effects like loops etc, and crossfade from one side to the other. It also lets you scratch your songs, set and recall cues, and all the other regular features DJs expect to find to be able to mix.\r\n\r\nIt will let you organize your collection of tracks and group them easily in a DJ-friendly way, using filter to find the hot songs, or find compatible bpm or key, access your previous playlists, etc. And if you are missing a track, VirtualDJ will automatically find it on the Internet and stream it directly (requires an additional subscription). And, using the millions of automatic reports we get every day from other VirtualDJ users around the world, it will give you meaningful advices on which songs other DJs consider to go well after what you just played. VirtualDJ can play not only audio tracks, but also video or karaoke, if you connect your computer to a projector or the clubs screens","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f71d1bbd421972fbf14618e14de7bd4e259334d","amp;dn":"Atomix+VirtualDJ+Pro+Infinity+8.2.3286+Multilingual-Keygen+R2R-%3D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f71d1bbd421972fbf14618e14de7bd4e259334d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,113,209,187,212,33,151,47,191,20,97,142,20,222,123,212,226,89,51,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
