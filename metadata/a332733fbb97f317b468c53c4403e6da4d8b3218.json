Cream--Eric Clapton (guitar, vocals), Jack Bruce (bass, vocals) and Ginger Baker (drums)--formed in 1966 and disbanded in 1968. In a little over two years, they released four groundbreaking albums, played over 300 gigs and secured worldwide acclaim and success with their unique take on electrified blues. They produced some of the most enduring rock anthems including Sunshine of Your Love, I Feel Free, Strange Brew and Crossroads.  This career-spanning collection spotlights both sides of the Cream catalogue--the wildly experimental studio outfit and the stripped-down live trio--combining newly re-mastered studio classics along with eight historic live performances.  Beginning as imaginative blues revivalists, Cream quickly evolved into a riskier unit, mining an audacious assortment of jazz, folk, pop, blues and psychedelic elements. Cream made adventurous, original music that reflected the restless energy of its era, yet continues to resonate nearly four decades later. This album comprises 22 studio tracks, plus &quot;Crossroads&quot; (live).\n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Wrapping Paper\n[02] I Feel Free\n[03] N.S.U\n[04] Sweet Wine\n[05] I'm So Glad\n[06] Strange Brew\n[07] Sunshine Of Your Love\n[08] World Of Pain\n[09] Tales Of Brave Ulysses\n[10] Swlabr\n[11] We're Going Wrong\n[12] White Room\n[13] Sitting On Top Of The World\n[14] Passing The Time\n[15] Politician\n[16] Those Were The Days\n[17] Born Under A Bad Sign\n[18] Deserted Cities Of The Heart\n[19] Crossroads\n[20] Anyone For Tennis\n[21] Badge\n[22] Doing That Scrapyard Thing\n[23] What A Bringdown\n\nCD Play Time - 01h:19m:45s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 515mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
