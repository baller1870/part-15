His highborn mother is the daughter of an aristocratic family, his father a poor Jew. Their marriage flouts tradition and makes them social pariahs in the London of the 1860s; and their son, Sherlock, bears the burden of their rebellion. Friendless, bullied at school, he belongs nowhere and has only his wits to help him make his way.\nBut what wits they are! His keen powers of observation are already apparent, though he is still a boy. He loves to amuse himself by constructing histories from the smallest detail for everyone he meets. Partly for fun, he focuses his attention on a sensational murder to see if he can solve it. But his game turns deadly serious when he finds himself the accused Ã¢â‚¬â€ and in London, they hang boys of thirteen. Shane Peacock has created a boy who bears all the seeds of the character who has mesmerized millions: the relentless eye, the sense of justice, and the complex ego. The boy Sherlock Holmes is a fascinating character who is sure to become a fast favorite with young readers everywhere. \n\nBook 2 - Death in the Air: His Second Case (Apr 8, 2008)\nAfter the harrowing experience of losing his mother while solving a brutal murder in London's East End, young Sherlock Holmes commits himself to fighting crime Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ and is soon involved in another case. While visiting his father at the magnificent Crystal Palace, Sherlock stops to watch a remarkable and dangerous trapeze performance high above, framed by the stunning glass ceiling of the legendary building. Suddenly, the troupe's star is dropping, screaming and flailing, toward the floor. He lands with a sickening thud just a few feet away, and rolls up almost onto the boy's boots. Unconscious and bleeding profusely, his body is grotesquely twisted. In the mayhem that follows, Sherlock notices something that no one else sees Ã¢â‚¬â€ something is amiss with the trapeze bar! He knows that foul play is afoot. What he doesn't know is that his discovery will put him on a frightening, twisted trail that leads to an entire gang of notorious criminals. Wrapped in the fascinating world of Victorian entertainment, its dangerous performances, and London's dark underworld. \n\nBook 3 - Vanishing Girl: His Third Case (Oct 12, 2010)\nThe third case in the compelling Boy Sherlock Holmes series is full of as many twists and turns as the backstreets of Victorian London. \nWhen a wealthy young girl vanishes as if by magic in Hyde Park, Sherlock is once again driven to prove himself. In a heart-stopping race against time, an innocent boyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s survival depends on SherlockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to solve the mysterious puzzle of the Vanishing Girl. As complex as the maze that protects the missing girlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hiding place, this case takes Sherlock racing to the countryside, the coast, and into the lair of a menagerie of exotic, dangerous creatures. \nHaunted by memories of his shattered family, goaded by his enemies, driven to heal the fragile relationship between him and the beautiful Irene Doyle, Sherlock makes an almost fatal mistake. In the end, his brilliant powers of deduction and the steadfast eccentric Sigerson Bell save the day. Soon, very soon, the world will come to know him as the master detective of all time. \n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18a5de32ca65199ff0123d486d6612194a7f1692","amp;dn":"Boy+Sherlock+Holmes%28First+3+Books%29+by+Shane+Peacock+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18a5de32ca65199ff0123d486d6612194a7f1692","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,165,222,50,202,101,25,159,240,18,61,72,109,102,18,25,74,127,22,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
