She rose to fame in the late 1980s with her debut album The Lion and the Cobra and achieved worldwide success in 1990 with a cover of the song &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot;.\n\nSince then, she has regularly courted controversy with her outspokenness, shorn head, and views on religion, women's rights, war and her own sexuality, while still maintaining a singing career.\n\nHer body of work includes a number of collaborations with other artists and appearances at charity fundraising concerts, in addition to her own solo albums.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI Do Not Want What I Haven't Got 1990 (reissued 2009)\n\n\nI Do Not Want What I Haven't Got is the second album by SinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ad O'Connor. It was released in 1990 on Chrysalis Records.\n\nThe critically-acclaimed album contains her most famous single, &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot;, and was one of the best selling records in the world in 1990, topping the charts in many countries, including the US, UK, and Canada. The single &quot;Emperor's New Clothes&quot; found more moderate success, although it did top the Modern Rock Tracks chart in the US.\n\nThe album includes O'Connor's rendition of &quot;I Am Stretched on Your Grave&quot;, an anonymous 17th century poem, originally written in Irish and translated into English by Philip King. The first song, &quot;Feels So Different&quot;, starts with The Serenity Prayer by Reinhold Niebuhr.\n\nThe inner sleeve notes acknowledge Kabbalah teacher, Warren Kenton: &quot;Special thanks to Selina Marshall + Warren Kenton for showing me that all I'd need was inside me.&quot;\n\nThe album was nominated for four Grammy Awards in 1991, winning the award for Best Alternative Music Performance. O'Connor refused to accept the nominations and the award.[7]\n\nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 406 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.[8]\n\nThe album sold 7 million copies worldwide.\n\nIn 2009, Sinead announced the release of a deluxe anniversary edition of the album, with an extra CD of unreleased tracks, B-sides and hard-to-find mixes.\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nDisc 1 - Original Release \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Feel So Different&quot;\n2.\t&quot;I Am Stretched on Your Grave&quot;\n3.\t&quot;Three Babies&quot;\n4.\t&quot;The Emperor's New Clothes&quot;\n5.\t&quot;Black Boys on Mopeds&quot;\n6.\t&quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot;\n7.\t&quot;Jump in the River&quot;\n8.\t&quot;You Cause as Much Sorrow&quot;\n9.\t&quot;The Last Day of Our Acquaintance&quot;\n10.\t&quot;I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nDisc 2 - Bonus Disc \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Night Nurse&quot;\n2.\t&quot;My Special Child&quot;\n3.\t&quot;Damn Your Eyes&quot;\n4.\t&quot;Silent Night&quot; (Long Version)\n5.\t&quot;You Do Something to Me&quot;\n6.\t&quot;Mind Games&quot;\n7.\t&quot;What Do You Want&quot;\n8.\t&quot;I Am Stretched on Your Grave&quot; (Apple Brightness Mix)\n9.\t&quot;Troy&quot; (recorded 'live' in London)\n10.\t&quot;I Want Your (Hands on Me)&quot; (live at Hammersmith Odeon)\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e347658415769dee42e8fd704d8eb9ebbe03afc9","amp;dn":"Sinead+O+Conner+-+I+Do+Not+Want..+%282009+Deluxe%29+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e347658415769dee42e8fd704d8eb9ebbe03afc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,71,101,132,21,118,157,238,66,232,253,112,77,142,185,235,190,3,175,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
