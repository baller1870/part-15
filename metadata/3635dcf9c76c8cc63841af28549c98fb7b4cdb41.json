Here the central character is \nan old-fashioned loner of a gunman (Lee Marvin) embroiled with a large-scale, corporate \ncriminal operation behind a respectable-looking &amp;#039;front&amp;#039;. Without delving into psychology or \nmotivation, the film places emphasis on action and surface appearances, superbly capturing the \nglossy, depersonalized feel of a 1967 Los Angeles--a nightmare landscape of concrete, glass \nand coiling freeways. \n\nFORMAT: Color, Widescreen, NTSC (DVDrip DIVX avi format)\nREGION: Region 1 (U.S.)\nSTUDIO: Warner Home Video\nRUN TIME: 92 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3635dcf9c76c8cc63841af28549c98fb7b4cdb41","amp;dn":"%7BMOVIE%7D+-+Point+Blank+%281967%29+%5BDVDrip+DIVX%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3635dcf9c76c8cc63841af28549c98fb7b4cdb41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,53,220,249,199,108,140,198,56,65,175,40,84,156,152,251,123,76,219,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
