Directed by Lewis Milestone. Music by Miklos Rozsa, maybe the best noir composer ever.\n\nGreat stars, great performances, and murder, amateur-style and with passion, exactly the way you or I would do it.\n\n*******************\n\nPlease seed at least 1:1, a bit more if you can. Thank you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c554d2154bf2ac1bf67c8fdadbcea1c2a17d4e82","amp;dn":"The+Strange+Love+of+Martha+Ivers+%281946+film+noir%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c554d2154bf2ac1bf67c8fdadbcea1c2a17d4e82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,84,210,21,75,242,172,27,246,124,143,218,219,206,161,194,161,125,78,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
