The bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name may be recent, but the members arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t: we have Tim Yatras aka Sorrow (Germ, ex-Austere) and Matt Bell aka Anguish (Bane Of Isildur, Rise Of Avernus, Troldhaugen) in the projectÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ranks. Working together is also not new for both of them, given that Matt Bell has already worked with Tim Yatras when the last one decided to go live with his personal project Germ, and since they connected so well, the best thing to do was to join forces and give birth to a full project.\n\nAnnounced as a depressive album, the opening track Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Ashes Of A LifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a good example of the entire album, as we have a mellow song bodied by a teenage feeling that I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t very fond of. However, the record evolves into something more adult and compact, having TimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s growls alternating with clean voices in a powerful, melodic and catchy chorus in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Until My Heart Corrodes With RustÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. In a similar way, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Grace Of The GraveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ also presents a melodic and catchy chorus using a high-pitched voice Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a feature that can be considered a trademark in Ã¢â‚¬Å“GoneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Other praiseworthy traits include the fire-like sound explosions and the drumming work on the hanging toms delivered by Tim Yatras. European influences can also be heard in Ã¢â‚¬Å“GoneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as we have a calm passage in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Black Stare, Dead EyesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ recalling the last years of Sentenced. AustereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s characteristic catalog wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forgotten as well Ã¢â‚¬â€œ there are nostalgic and spatial soundscapes mixed with doomed guitar riffs in Ã¢â‚¬Å“When The Sun Sets For The Last TimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nIn general, AutumnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dawn is like redefining what Tim Yatras has done with Desolation (Woods Of Desolation) in the short-lived band Grey Waters, but adding a rock-sounded direction without setting aside the fast and aggressive drumming, as well as combined with the amazing melancholic and sad guitar passages (that are so Yatras), like for example in the track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Through The Rusted Gates Of TimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Ã¢â‚¬Å“GoneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ may be seen as a first stop for those who are discovering depressive sonorities, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s far from being comparable to raw and really suicidal acts Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and I honestly think thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not Tim and MattÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intention.\n\nLine-up:\n\n\nAnguish (Matthew Bell) - Bass, Guitars, Keyboards\n\nSorrow (Tim Yatras) - Drums, Guitars, Vocals\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.
