If I had been asked to evaluate Invitation before hearing this release, I wouldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve said it was a fairly typical early-60s hard-bop record, led by the great vibraphonist Milt Jackson. I might have added that it suffers from neither the overly careful approach that plagued much of the Modern Jazz QuartetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s output, nor from the opposite extreme, of simply blowing long solos on overly familiar standards, something Jackson has done more than enough of in his time. The success of Invitation owes on both counts to the presence of trumpeter Kenny Dorham and alto saxophonist Jimmy Heath. Each contributes not only fine solos, but a couple of nifty arrangements. But what this listener had not fully appreciated from earlier releases is the fantastically subtle interplay of the rhythm section: Tommy Flanagan, piano, Ron Carter, bass, and Connie Heath on drums. On this remastered LP, one hears every nuance with delicious clarity, from the crackle of KayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cymbals to the big, fat sound of CarterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s walking lines. Rarely have JacksonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s uniquely swinging vibes been heard in a more sympathetic setting","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:397da05df6aa8dd1c73574dd820a14071b7165ab","amp;dn":"Milt+Jackson++-+Invitation+%281962%29+%5BFLAC%5D+%28MFSL+UDSACD+2031%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"397da05df6aa8dd1c73574dd820a14071b7165ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,125,160,93,246,170,141,209,199,53,116,221,130,10,20,7,27,113,101,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
