Developing Android on Android will teach you how to use the latest cutting-edge technologies to tailor your Android experience to your mobile lifestyle.\n\nWrite scripts that listen to your voice and post spoken tweets on Twitter. Track your phoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s status and have it report its location every ten minutes via an instant message. Query and listen to weather forecasts with the click of a headset button. Have system notifications and new SMS messages automatically read to you. Design your own application launcher with a look and behavior that can be dynamically modified depending on the scripts and applications you execute.\n\nWith step-by-step instructions throughout, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll master how to develop your own custom applications. And because youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be using programming tools on your Android, you can change and improve your programs at any time. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll build new Android programs and task-driven on-board workflows faster than any traditional Android development environment could hope to match!\n\nWhat You Need\nAn Android smartphone or tablet running Android 4.0 or higher.\n\nTable of Contents\nPart I: Customize\nChapter 1.
