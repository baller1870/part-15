Unrar and play..\n\n\n\nWhen the forces of ancient worlds, and past forgotten myths battle against the power of old friends. When current emotions clash with past regret, and when some guys in York design cunning puzzles, write funny scripts and orchestrate the type of music to make the hair on the back of your next stand on end, it can only mean the fourth instalment of Broken Sword has been born. After reluctantly battling dragons, Mayan gods and becoming a Knight of a long lost Holy Order, unwitting hero George Stobbart settles down to a life of mundane 9-5 office work. Who would have thought that a mysterious and beautiful woman would enter his life; a woman whose sudden disappearance draws him into a desperate search for a nefarious artefact of great and terrible power. (Well apart from those guys in York, that is) Emotion, humour, time pressure and puzzling combine for the latest Broken Sword Adventure and unfortunately for George, it looks like the world needs saving one more time. \n\n\n[THQ]PUBLISHER:\tTHQ\nDEVELOPER:\tRevolution Software - Sumo Digital\nGENRE(S):\tAdventure\nPLAYERS:\t1\nESRB RATING:\tT (Teen)\nRELEASE DATE:\tFebruary 19, 2007","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32fd69ed0cbfa5f27bc9e2820c1711937cb72ce8","amp;dn":"Broken+Sword+4+The+Angel+of+Death","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32fd69ed0cbfa5f27bc9e2820c1711937cb72ce8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,253,105,237,12,191,165,242,123,201,226,130,12,23,17,147,124,183,44,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
