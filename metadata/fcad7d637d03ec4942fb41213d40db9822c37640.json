From ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s umbrella and Leonardo da VinciÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pyramid-shaped flying device to the first air-plane jump in 1912, the urge to leap and soar with the wind has long been a part of history. Parachuting has come a long way since its earliest days due to the advancement of technology, and, now, more people then ever are taking up this in-credible sport.
