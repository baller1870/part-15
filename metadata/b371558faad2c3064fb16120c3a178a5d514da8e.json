Stradlin has a stronger presence on I, contributing three of the best songs -- &quot;Dust n' Bones,&quot; &quot;You Ain't the First,&quot; and &quot;Double Talkin' Jive&quot; -- which help keep the album in Stonesy Aerosmith territory. On the whole, the album is stronger than II, even though there's a fair amount of filler, including a song that takes its title from the Osmonds' biggest hit, and a dippy psychedelic collaboration with Alice Cooper. But it also has two ambitious set pieces, &quot;Novermber Rain&quot; and &quot;Coma,&quot; which find Rose fulfilling his ambitions, as well as the ferocious, metallic &quot;Perfect Crime,&quot; and the original version of the power ballad &quot;Don't Cry.&quot; \n \n  \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Dust N' bones [04:58] \n 02.Live and let die [03:04] \n 03.Don't cry (original) [04:45] \n 04.Perfect crime [02:24] \n 05.You ain't the first [02:36] \n 06.Bad obsession [05:28] \n 07.Back off bitch [05:04] \n 08.Double talkin' jive [03:24] \n 09.November rain [08:58] \n 10.The garden [05:22] \n 11.Garden of eden [02:42] \n 12.Don't damn me [05:19] \n 13.Bad apples [04:28] \n 14.Dead horse [04:18] \n 15.Coma [10:17] \n ____ \n \n 73:07 min \n 111,3 MB ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b371558faad2c3064fb16120c3a178a5d514da8e","amp;dn":"Guns_N_Roses-Use_Your_Illusion_1-%28Retail%29-1991-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b371558faad2c3064fb16120c3a178a5d514da8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,113,85,143,170,210,195,6,79,177,97,32,195,161,120,165,213,20,218,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
