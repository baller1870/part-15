While much of the attention is given to the interplay between guitarists Jansch and Renbourn, percussionist Terry Cox and bassist Danny Thompson make a formidable rhythm section. In addition, Jacqui McShee more than holds her own with contemporaries like Sandy Denny and Maddy Prior. Most of these songs are taken from their first three (and arguably their best) albums. Highlights include the 7-minute instrumental ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPentangling,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSweet ChildÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and their remake of the JaynettsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ 1963 hit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSally Go ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Round the Roses.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Only the last five tracks are culled from their last three albums. Of special note is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLord FranklinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from 1970ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s Cruel  Sister which features Renbourn on guitar and Jansch on concertina.\nDisc two contains solo material from John Renbourn before, during and after his collaboration with Pentangle. The disc begins with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJudy,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ an instrumental from his 1965 self-titled debut, and concludes with another instrumental, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Hermit,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from his 1976 album of the same name. In addition to the folk material he is best known for, there are several tracks from Faro  Annie (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhite House Blues,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShake Shake MamaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the title track) where he works in a blues vein. He also shows his jazz side on the Charles Mingus tune ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGoodbye Pork Pie Hat,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a duet with Bert Jansch.\nDisc three does the same for Bert Jansch. It covers material from his first eight albums, beginning with 1965ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s self-titled debut and stops with 1973ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s Moonshine (his first album for Reprise after leaving Transatlantic). Jansch is a gifted guitar player and songwriter and expressive singer. Standout tracks are the bleak ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNeedle of DeathÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the lovely ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRosemary Lane.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nDisc 1\n\n\nPentangle\n 1.
