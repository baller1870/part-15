Players attempt to complete three circuits while keeping their chariots and drivers in tact. The main challenge is maneuvering around the bends while attempting to disable or block your opponents. The game has some brief miniature rules and provisions for all sorts of carnage. Maneuvering cards also add a bit of randomness to the race. Not for the serious strategist, but all in all a nice fun diversion.\n\nCircus Imperium published in 1988, but it has been out of print for almost 20 years. It is favorite at many cons and a great game. The sell for outrageous prices (I have seen it on EBay for 100.00 and Amazon for 1000.00. I think that it ridiculous that a few gamers are holding such a great game for ransom. These are scans of the parts and pieces in the game; with them, you should be able to recreate the game. Please print and play the game.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63af92d32369ade0a364cf0021dcf8f569af2ce8","amp;dn":"Circus+Imperium+FASA+1988","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63af92d32369ade0a364cf0021dcf8f569af2ce8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,175,146,211,35,105,173,224,163,100,207,0,33,220,248,245,105,175,44,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
