David Icke talks with the Zulu Shaman Credo Mutwa.\n\nIn this fantastic interview, Credo Mutwa reveals the story of the reptilian takeover of Planet Earth and how a shape-shifting Reptilian race (the &quot;Chitauri&quot; to Africans) has controlled humanity for thousands of years and how their bloodlines are in the positions of royal, political and economic power today. This program will re-write the UFO/ET story in a way that will blow your mind.\n\nCredo Mutwa has had attempts on his life and endless threats in an effort to silence him right up to the recording of this interview, but, as Credo says, &quot;The world must know this ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and know it now.&quot; David Icke writes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ &quot;This is the most amazing man it has ever been my honor to meet, a genius, and the importance of these videos is simply beyond words.
