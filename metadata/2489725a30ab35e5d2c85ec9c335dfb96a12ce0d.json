Undoubtedly, these three figures did much to shape the group's sound, but throughout their career, the Yardbirds were very much a unit, albeit a rather unstable one. And they were truly one of the great rock bands; one whose contributions went far beyond the scope of their half dozen or so mid-'60s hits (&quot;For Your Love,&quot; &quot;Heart Full of Soul,&quot; &quot;Shapes of Things,&quot; &quot;I'm a Man,&quot; &quot;Over Under Sideways Down,&quot; &quot;Happenings Ten Years Time Ago&quot;). Not content to limit themselves to the R&amp;B and blues covers they concentrated upon initially, they quickly branched out into moody, increasingly experimental pop/rock. The innovations of Clapton, Beck, and Page redefined the role of the guitar in rock music, breaking immense ground in the use of feedback, distortion, and amplification with finesse and breathtaking virtuosity. With the arguable exception of the Byrds, they did more than any other outfit to pioneer psychedelia, with an eclectic, risk-taking approach that laid the groundwork for much of the hard rock and progressive rock from the late '60s to the present.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-yardbirds-p5888/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-yardbirds-p5888/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Bruce Eder):\n\nThis is another of the ubiquitous Yardbirds compilations to utilize the band's 1963-1966 output, what are referred to informally as the Giorgio Gomelsky tapes (referring to their ex-manager, though he sold his rights to this material off decades ago). As a compilation, it's mainly distinguished by its relatively good sound -- they've gone to good tape sources -- and their willingness to program the group's early rock &amp; roll and blues sides, including &quot;Pontiac Blues&quot; featuring Sonny Boy Williamson II on vocals and harp, alongside their subsequent pop-oriented hits, including &quot;For Your Love,&quot; and the early stirrings of experimentation in &quot;Heart Full of Soul&quot; in its sitar version; it ends with the Jeff Beck/Jimmy Page-dominated number &quot;Stroll On&quot; from Blow Up, as most of the Gomelsky tape compilations do. The track-by-track annotation at least indicates that some serious effort was made to put this collection together. There's nothing new here, however, from the standpoint of anyone who knows the band -- it's an okay place to start out listening to the Yardbirds in 2005, if that's what one is doing (though this reviewer would've found room for &quot;You're a Better Man Than I&quot;), but otherwise unexceptional in a historical context.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/the-very-best-of-the-yardbirds-metro-r794000/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/the-very-best-of-the-yardbirds-metro-r794000/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000AAVDHO&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000AAVDHO&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
