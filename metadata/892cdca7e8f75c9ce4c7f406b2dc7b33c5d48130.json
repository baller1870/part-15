Produced by Rick Derringer with Ronnie Montrose on guitars and engineered by Bill Szymezyk who later produced Hotel California and other Eagle hits, They Only Come Out at Night didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t gain immediate commercial success. Winter and the band thought the song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFree RideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was the most commercially feasible tune and after a disappointing brief appearance on the charts the band started talking about their next project. \nMeanwhile, a grass roots phenomenon was spreading across the country. Underground college FM stations all across the US discovered a b-side tune called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFrankensteinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Winter and his band mates basically had a great time jamming on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFrankensteinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ but never considered the over 4 minute tune to be commercially viable. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFrankensteinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was soon one of the most frequently requested songs on mainstream AM stations and astonishingly climbed to #1 on the charts! The album reached the #3 position and the re-released ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFree RideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ reached #14.\n\n\nRecording information: HIt Factory; Sterling Sound Studio, New York, NY.\n\n\nTracklist\n1.
