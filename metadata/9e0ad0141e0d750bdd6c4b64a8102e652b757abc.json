The principles of microprocessor design are made concrete\nby extensive illustrations based upon the ARM.\nThe aim of the book is to assist the reader in understanding how SoCs and microprocessors\nare designed and used, and why a modern processor is designed the way\nthat it is. The reader who wishes to know only the general principles should find that\nthe ARM illustrations add substance to issues which can otherwise appear somewhat\nethereal; the reader who wishes to understand the design of the ARM should find that\nthe general principles illuminate the rationale for the ARM being as it is.\nOther microprocessor architectures are not described in this book. The reader who\nwishes to make a comparative study of architectures will find the required information\non the ARM here but must look elsewhere for information on other designs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e0ad0141e0d750bdd6c4b64a8102e652b757abc","amp;dn":"Arm+-+System-on-chip+architecture","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e0ad0141e0d750bdd6c4b64a8102e652b757abc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,10,208,20,30,13,117,11,221,108,75,100,168,16,46,101,43,117,122,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
