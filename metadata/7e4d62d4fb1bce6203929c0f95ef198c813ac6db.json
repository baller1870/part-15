A combination of the word, the image and evocative music Ã¢â‚¬â€œ possibly one of the best things of its kind that has come from Greek television. Video quality is excellent for its age.\n\nThese are DVD files but compressed to a little over their original size by Cinema Craft Encoder and DVD Rebuilder i.e they are as good as the originals. Kindly seed - I can only do so for a few weeks. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e4d62d4fb1bce6203929c0f95ef198c813ac6db","amp;dn":"Greece+-+%27Thus+Spake+the+City%27+-+Cavafy%2C+Seferis+etc+-+Yannis+Sm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e4d62d4fb1bce6203929c0f95ef198c813ac6db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,77,98,212,251,27,206,98,3,146,156,15,149,239,25,140,129,58,198,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
