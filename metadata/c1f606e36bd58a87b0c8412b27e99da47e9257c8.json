Though most guys would lose their shit, he stays calm and shows you how to deal with these gregarious types. They're really fun and aggressive. However, as Jason explains, this does not mean you should lose yourself or your dominance. Jason shows how you can give up the conversation but still lead the interaction to show you are still in fact, a dominant man.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1f606e36bd58a87b0c8412b27e99da47e9257c8","amp;dn":"Simple+Pickup%3A+Project+Go+-+Week+38%3A+Outgoing+Girls","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1f606e36bd58a87b0c8412b27e99da47e9257c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,246,6,227,107,213,138,135,176,200,65,43,39,233,157,164,126,146,87,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
