Will also work with any USB and FIREWIRE external drive enclosures as well as SD, MMC, MemoryStick and CompactFlash media.\n\nThe tool creates a sector-by-sector copy of all areas of the hard drive (MBR, boot records, all partitions as well as space in between). HDD Raw Copy does not care about the operating system on the drive Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it could be Windows, Linux, Mac, or any other OS with any number of partitions (including hidden ones). Bad sectors are skipped by the tool.\n\nIf your media has a supported interface then it can be copied with HDD Raw Copy!\n\nIn addition, HDD Raw Copy can create an exact raw (dd) or compressed image of the entire media (including service data such as MBR, Boot records, etc). Again, all filesystems (even hidden) are supported.\n\nExamples of possible uses\n\n    * Data recovery: make a copy of the damaged drive to attempt recovery on the copy\n    * Data recovery: copy a damaged hard drive and skip bad sectors\n    * Migration: completely migrate from one hard drive to another\n    * Ultimate backup: Make an exact copy of the hard drive for future use\n    * Backup: create an image of a USB flash stick and copy/restore at any moment\n    * Software QA engineers: restore your OS hard drives at any moment from a compressed image\n    * Duplicate/Clone/Save full image of any type of media! \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acb6459af33ba882865e9f6119efdd06be73e6fa","amp;dn":"USB+duplicator+drv+to+drv+or+to+file+and+back+%28portable%29+freewar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acb6459af33ba882865e9f6119efdd06be73e6fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,182,69,154,243,59,168,130,134,94,159,97,25,239,221,6,190,115,230,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
