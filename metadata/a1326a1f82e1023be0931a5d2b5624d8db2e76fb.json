Allan, Dodick David W., &quot;Headache (Cambridge Pocket Clinicians)&quot;\nCambridge University Press | 2010 | ISBN: 0521720575 | 256 pages | PDF \n\nHeadache is the most common presenting symptom in neurology and constitutes more than one-third of primary care consultations. Organized according to the presenting features of the headache (acute, episodic and chronic), this handbook provides diagnostic and treatment information for both common and uncommon causes of headache. Making maximum use of lists, bullet points, summary boxes and illustrations, it allows the reader fast access to essential information where it is needed most. Each topic is dealt with succinctly, using up-to-date knowledge and experience of the authors, all of whom are headache experts from leading clinical centers in the USA and Canada. Providing comprehensive and detailed coverage to satisfy the needs of the busy neurologist, residents in neurology, neurosurgery, psychiatry and other fields of internal medicine, this book will also be a valuable guide to practising clinicians who do not deal with headache on a regular basis.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1326a1f82e1023be0931a5d2b5624d8db2e76fb","amp;dn":"Headache+%28Cambridge+Pocket+Clinicians%29+%282010%29+-%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1326a1f82e1023be0931a5d2b5624d8db2e76fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,50,106,31,130,225,2,59,224,147,26,93,43,86,36,216,219,46,118,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
