Her paternal grandfather died in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp (her paternal grandparents were Jewish). Her parents divorced when she was two years old, and growing up she saw her father infrequently. At age four, she began to study ballet, and was considered an opera prodigy by the time she was nine.\nWhen Hagen was 11, her mother married Wolf Biermann, an anti-establishment singer-songwriter. Biermann's political views later influenced young Hagen.\nHagen left school at age sixteen, and went to Poland, where she began her career.[2][3] After that, she returned to Germany and joined the cover band Fritzens Dampferband (Fritzen's Steamboat Band), together with Achim Mentzel and others. She added songs by Janis Joplin and Tina Turner to the &quot;allowable&quot; set lists during shows.\nFrom 1972 to 1973, Hagen enrolled in the crash-course performance program at The Central Studio for Light Music in East Berlin. Upon graduation, she formed the band Automobil.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1 &quot;Zarah&quot;\n2 &quot;New York New York&quot;\n3 &quot;Smack Jack&quot;\n4 &quot;TV-Glotzer (White Punks On Dope)&quot;\n5 &quot;Spirit In The Sky&quot;\n6 &quot;African Reggae&quot;\n7 &quot;Universal Radio&quot; (Universal Dance Mix)\n8 &quot;My Sensation&quot;\n9 &quot;Iki Maska&quot;\n10 &quot;Wir Leben Immer Noch (Lucky Number)&quot;\n11 &quot;Cosma Shiva&quot;\n12 &quot;Zarah&quot; (Dance Mix)\n13 &quot;Zarah&quot; (Dub)\n14 &quot;My Way&quot;\n\n\nSummary:\nCountry: Germany\nGenre: Rock\nStyles: Punk rock, post-punk, new wave, gothic rock, glam rock, Neue Deutsche Welle, Neue Deutsche HÃƒÂ¤rte\n\n\nMedia Report:\nSource : CD\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 1 025 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcb372d2b6e9a0acfc6d796eb83632c80a678a0f","amp;dn":"%281996%29+Nina+Hagen+-+14+Friendly+Abductions+-+The+Best+Of+%5BFLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcb372d2b6e9a0acfc6d796eb83632c80a678a0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,179,114,210,182,233,160,172,252,109,121,110,184,54,50,200,10,103,138,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
