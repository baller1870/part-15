The book focuses on the moral nature of laissez-faire capitalism and private property. The book has a very specific definition of capitalism, a system it regards as broader than simply property rights or free enterprise. It was originally published in 1966.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:252b7e6d042bb8e03ace53c2544dfb000caeaff4","amp;dn":"Ayn+Rand+-+Capitalism+%3AThe+Unknown+Ideal+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bpdf%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"252b7e6d042bb8e03ace53c2544dfb000caeaff4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,43,126,109,4,43,184,224,58,206,83,194,84,77,251,0,12,174,175,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
