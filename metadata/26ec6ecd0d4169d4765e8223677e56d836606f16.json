Written by singer Freddie Mercury, the track featured on their 1976 album A Day at the Races, from which it was also released as the lead single.\n\nLike &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, the major hit from Queen's previous album A Night at the Opera (1975), &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; has a complex melody and deep layering of vocal tracks, this time based on a gospel choir arrangement. It was the first single off the album A Day at the Races. It is a rock ballad on which band members Freddie Mercury, Brian May and Roger Taylor multitracked their voices to create the impression of a 100-voice gospel choir. The lyrics, especially combined with the gospel influence, create a song about faith, desperation and soul-searching; the singer questions both the lack of love experienced in his life, and the role and existence of God. Staying true to Queen's guitar-driven style, it was also filled with intricate harmonies and a notable guitar solo by Brian May, and it went to number 2 on the UK charts and number 13 on the U.S. singles chart. The song possesses a great variety of notes, ranging from G#2 to a C5 in full voice up to an AÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€žÂ¢Ã‚Â­5 in falsetto.\n\nA promotional video was made combining a staged recording session at Sarm East Studios (where the A Day at the Races album was recorded) and film footage of the band's performance at Hyde Park that September. Peter Hince, the head of Queen's road crew, recalled to Mojo magazine: &quot;Aesthetically, you had to have all four around the microphone, but John (Deacon) didn't sing on the records. By his own admission he didn't have the voice. He did sing on-stage but the crew always knew to keep the fader very low.&quot; The song was included on their first Greatest Hits, released in 1981.\n\nA Day at the Races is the fifth album by British rock group Queen, released in December 1976. A Day at the Races was the Queen's first completely self-produced album, and the first not to feature producer Roy Thomas Baker. Recorded at Sarm East, The Manor and Wessex Studios in England, A Day at the Races was engineered by Mike Stone. The title of the album followed suit with its predecessor A Night at the Opera in taking its name from a film by the Marx Brothers.\n\nIn recent years, a number of publications have cited A Day at the Races as one of the band's finest works. The album peaked at number one in the UK, Japan and the Netherlands. It reached number five on the US Billboard 200 and was Queen's fifth album to ship gold (500,000 units shipped) in the US. It subsequently reached platinum status (one million shipped) in the US.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26ec6ecd0d4169d4765e8223677e56d836606f16","amp;dn":"Queen+-+Somebody+To+Love++%28Xvid-2nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26ec6ecd0d4169d4765e8223677e56d836606f16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,236,110,205,13,65,105,212,118,94,130,35,103,126,86,216,54,96,111,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
