It was first released in 1985. Jimmy Page contributes.\nWith a working title of Rizla due to the album's cover art (an unravelled orange Rizla pack), Jugula, as this album is often called, was released on the Beggars Banquet label (BBL60) and reached the UK Top 20. The album contains a number of original songs written by Harper. It is recorded in a fresh and spontaneous manner, often with only the unique sound of Ovation guitars and vocals. Occasionally, the arrangements are filled with synthesizer and electric guitar.\n\nThis album in particular brought Harper to a new and wider audience, mainly due to Harper and Jimmy Page's appearances at the Cambridge Folk Festival in 1984, an album tour and a 15-minute televised interview by Mark Ellen on the Old Grey Whistle Test (16 November 1984). The interview featured Harper and Page playing their acoustic guitars on the side of Side Pike in the English Lake District, a somewhat different and unusual interview for the time. Songs played included &quot;Hangman&quot; and part of &quot;The Same Old Rock&quot;.\n\nThis album was the fifth that Harper and Page had worked on, but the first entire record they made together.Page's guitar playing is quite evident throughout the album, and is a natural complement to Harper's unique guitar work. The first track, &quot;Nineteen Forty-Eightish&quot;, a reference to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, crescendos with lead guitar by Page. Other tracks include &quot;Hangman&quot;, a song that expresses the feelings of an innocent man condemned to die and &quot;Frozen Moment&quot;, a song played entirely in the chord of C#.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5bb283f790dd4aee8a7f5796af9b29491b014a8","amp;dn":"Roy+Harper+%26amp%3B+Jimmy+Page+-+Whatever+Happened+to+Jugula%3F%5BFlac+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5bb283f790dd4aee8a7f5796af9b29491b014a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,187,40,63,121,13,212,174,232,167,245,121,106,249,178,148,145,176,20,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
