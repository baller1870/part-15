His plan was ambitious if not far-fetched: use the national rugby team, the Springboks-long an embodiment of white-supremacist rule-to embody and engage a new South Africa as they prepared to host the 1995 World Cup. The string of wins that followed not only defied the odds, but capped Mandela's miraculous effort to bring South Africans together again in a hard-won, enduring bond.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d5a964a27665124cfd344edc8aadcc8b22d7573","amp;dn":"Playing+the+Enemy+-+Nelson+Mandela+And+The+Game+That+Made+A+Nati","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d5a964a27665124cfd344edc8aadcc8b22d7573","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,90,150,74,39,102,81,36,207,211,68,237,200,170,220,200,178,45,117,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
