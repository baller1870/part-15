Nonetheless, many of his poems are relatively unknown to English-speaking audiences, partly because of the difficulties they have posed to translators.\n\nThis volume contains translations, side by side with the German originals, of Goethe's major poems from 1768 to 1830 -- all prepared by eminent American and English writers, and all attesting to his poetic genius.\n\n____________________________________________\n\nFor more works by Goethe, see the following:\n\n* THE SUFFERINGS OF YOUNG WERTHER (Stanley Corngold, trans.) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8870454/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8870454/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n* FAUST (David Luke, trans.) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8865991/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8865991/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n* FAUST (Walter Kaufmann, trans.) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8428467/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8428467/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8db7070c6c07ed00801526ce697988fe82b1a55","amp;dn":"Goethe+-+Selected+Poems%2C+1768-1830","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8db7070c6c07ed00801526ce697988fe82b1a55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,219,112,112,198,192,126,208,8,1,82,108,230,151,152,143,232,43,26,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
