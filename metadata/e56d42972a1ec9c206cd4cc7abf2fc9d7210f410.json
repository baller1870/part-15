Tackling one of history\\'s darkest episodes, he poses the question: What if Hitler had never been born? An unquestionable improvement, no doubt. Michael Young, an earnest young history graduate student, has just finished his dissertation, an exploration into the roots of evil and the early life of Adolf Hitler. When he meets up with an aging German physicist, they concoct an idealistic experiment that involves time travel to prevent the conception of the Fuhrer. It will change the course of history, but will it create a better world? With characteristic brilliance and wit, Fry presents a thought-provoking alternate history that is both trenchant and deeply affecting.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e56d42972a1ec9c206cd4cc7abf2fc9d7210f410","amp;dn":"Making+History+by+Stephen+Fry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e56d42972a1ec9c206cd4cc7abf2fc9d7210f410","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,109,66,151,42,30,201,194,6,205,76,199,171,242,252,157,114,16,244,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
