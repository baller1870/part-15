He presents a writer influenced by the early death of her father and the retreat from city life to country; an Irish Catholic upbringing that evolved into an adult fascination with theology; and a Southern small-town culture whose matrons, including O'Connor's mother, were happy for her success but put off by the unladylike nature of her work: &quot;Everybody here shakes my hand but nobody reads my stories.&quot; Though she spent time in both the Midwest and the Northeast, lupus narrowed the circle of her life to a dairy farm in Milledgeville, Georgia, where she collected exotic birds. Gooch's account is meticulous, but O'Connor's sedate, chaste life is pale in comparison with her fantastic fiction - a contrast that underscores her inscrutable genius. \n\n\n\n----------------\n\nStay tuned for more Flannery O'Connor to be posted here in the near future, including The Habit of Being.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3c2cd52fa5c1377a6e916050445e6f23dba49dc","amp;dn":"Brad+Gooch+-+Flannery%3A+A+Life+of+Flannery+O%27Connor+%28epub%2C+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3c2cd52fa5c1377a6e916050445e6f23dba49dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,194,205,82,250,92,19,119,166,233,22,5,4,69,230,242,61,186,73,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
