Hailing from the small town of Doraville, Georgia, the beginning of the Atlanta Rhythm Section can be traced back to 1970. It was then that a local recording studio was opened, Studio One, and the remnants of two groups (the Candymen and the Classics Four), became the studio's house band. One of the facility's head figures, Buddy Buie, soon began assembling the session band -- singer Rodney Justo, guitarist Barry Bailey, bassist Paul Goddard, keyboardist Dean Daughtry, and drummer Robert Nix. After playing on several artists' recordings, it was decided to take the band a step further and make the group of players a real band, leading to the formation of the Atlanta Rhythm Section.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Doraville\n02.Angel\n03.Crazy\n04.Dog Days\n05.All Night Rain\n06.Free Spirit\n07.Jukin'\n08.Neon Nites\n09.So Into You\n10.Georgia Rhythm\n11.Imaginary Lover\n12.Champagne Jam\n13.I'm Not Gonna Let It Bother Me Tonight\n14.Do It Or Die\n15.Spooky\n16.Indigo Passion\n17.Silver Eagle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n               ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:925da0df457ab1565ae1b4ff96bf9d6552b925d5","amp;dn":"Atlanta+Rhythm+Section-+The+Best+Of+ARS+++320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"925da0df457ab1565ae1b4ff96bf9d6552b925d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,93,160,223,69,122,177,86,90,225,180,255,150,191,157,101,82,185,37,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
