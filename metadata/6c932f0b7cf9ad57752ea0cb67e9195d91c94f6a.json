Paul suspects their fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s business partner Walser (Jerzy Radziwilowicz), who now runs the business in his place. Sylvie is not so sure, but she fears that her brother will rashly and foolishly try to kill him, so to cut him off she goes to kill Walser herself instead. This triggers a convoluted sequence of events in which Sylvie is placed in the same situation as her hated nemesis, coming to understand Walser and why he did what he did. The film doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t lack for drama, but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not what primarily interests Rivette. The most crucial narrative scenes have a kind of blunt, clipped quality, as though Rivette is only fulfilling an obligation by showing us these things. Violence happens quickly and abruptly, with a faint undertone of surrealist absurdity, and also a touch of RivetteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s theatricality: these are stage deaths, the gestures just slightly exaggerated and stylized.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c932f0b7cf9ad57752ea0cb67e9195d91c94f6a","amp;dn":"Secret+d%26eacute%3Bfense","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c932f0b7cf9ad57752ea0cb67e9195d91c94f6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,147,47,11,124,249,173,87,117,46,160,203,103,233,25,93,145,201,79,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
