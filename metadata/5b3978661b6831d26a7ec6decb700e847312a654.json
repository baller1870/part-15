To my surprise I came back in 2009 and discovered dozens of fans still sharing! Inspired by this, I have re-ripped both seasons 1 AND 2, in H.264-MKV format, from SD PAL DVD source. \nMay this one live on equally as long. Happy sledging!\nNote: if you happen to have a Western Digital media player these files will play unmodified.\n\nI find this is an excellent compression format, providing 720x544 with good resolution. XviD fans can use something like WinAVI to &quot;upmix&quot; back to XviD/avi but the file sizes will approximately double.\n\nSEASON 1\n\nTrust him. He knows what he's doing.\n\nIn the autumn of 1986, an unsuspecting nation met a new kind of comedy hero who made Rambo look like Pee Wee Herman. David Rasche starred as the trigger-happy lawman whose hatred of criminal scum and yoghurt eatin' creeps was matched only by his love of excessive force and a .44 Magnum.\n\nOver the next two series, this hilariously deranged lampoon of DIRTY HARRY and plenty of other targets became one of the most notorious series in television history and launched a rabid cult of fans that grows to this day. This is SLEDGE HAMMER!\n\nEpisodes comprise:\n\n1. Under The Gun [pilot]\n2. Hammer Gets Nailed\n3. Witless\n4. They Shoot Hammers, Don't They?\n5. Dori Day Afternoon\n6. To Sledge, With Love\n7. All Shook Up\n8. Over My Dead Bodyguard\n9. Magnum Farce\n10. If I Had A Little Hammer\n11. To Live &amp; Die On TV\n12. Miss Of The Spider Woman\n13. The Old Man And The Sledge\n14. State Of Sledge\n15. Haven't Gun, Will Travel\n16. The Colour Of Hammer\n17. Brother, Can You Spare A Crime?\n18. Desperately Seeking Dori\n19. Sledgepoo\n20. Comrade Hammer\n21. Jagged Sledge\n22. The Spa Who Loved Me\nBonus. Making Of Sledge Hammer\n\nSEASON 2\n\nTrust him, he still know what he's doing.\n\nIt would take more than a nuclear explosion to stop everyone's favourite violence-loving lawman! David Rasche returns - along with co-stars Anne-Marie Martin and Harrison Page - in the surprising (because nobody expected the network to renew it) second series.\n\nThese are the infamous final episodes featuring such guest stars as Richard Moll, Ray Walston, Edy Williams, Bud Cort, Bernie Kopell, Adam Ant, Davy Jones and more, in the &quot;sitcom for people who hate sitcoms&quot; that remains one of the most dangerously funny shows in TV history.\n\nEpisodes comprise:\n\n1. A Clockwork Hammer\n2. Big Nazi On Campus\n3. Play It Again, Sledge\n4. Wild About Hammer\n5. The Death Of A Few Salesmen\n6. Vertical\n7. Dressed To Call\n8. Hammer Hits The Rock (a.k.a. Sledge On The Rock)\n9. Hammeroid\n10. Last Of The Red Hot Vampires\n11. Sledge In Toyland\n12. Icebreaker\n13. They Call Me Mr. Trunk\n14. Model Dearest\n15. Sledge, Rattle And Roll\n16. Suppose They Gave A War And Sledge Came?\n17. The Secret Of My Excess\n18. It Happened What Night?\n19. Here's to You, Mrs. Hammer\t\t\nBonus. Gun Crazy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b3978661b6831d26a7ec6decb700e847312a654","amp;dn":"Sledge+Hammer+complete+Season+1+and+2%3A+H.264-MKV+Marble+Labs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b3978661b6831d26a7ec6decb700e847312a654","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,57,120,102,27,104,49,210,106,126,198,222,203,112,14,132,115,18,166,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
