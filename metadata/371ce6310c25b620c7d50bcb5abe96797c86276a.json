Now, this development has\n   reached a new climax in `Unseen', the band's seventh studio album, which is\n   easily the most outstanding amalgamation of THE HAUNTED's matchless musical\n   diversity and vocalist Peter Dolving's outspoken, often highly cynical\n   lyrical venom. And...it has become the band's catchiest, most melodic and\n   probably also most remarkable album as well!\n\n   Limited edition digipak with 3 bonus tracks - enjoy!\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
