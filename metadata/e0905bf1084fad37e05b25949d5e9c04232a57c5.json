And while the song may remain the same, Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, and John Bonham forever changed rock 'n' roll. To celebrate the band's anniversary and its immeasurable influence on popular music and culture, Atlantic Records/Rhino Entertainment will release a limited edition CD boxed set. This Japanese import contains all 10 of the quartet's albums in mini-LP replicas with artwork from the original U.K. LP sleeves.\n\nThe mini-LP replicas boxed set includes Led Zeppelin (1969), Led Zeppelin II (1969), Led Zeppelin III (1970), Led Zeppelin IV (1971), Houses of the Holy (1973), Physical Graffiti (1975), Presence (1976), The Song Remains the Same (1976), In Through the Out Door (1979), and Coda (1982).\n\nThe sleeves included in the boxed set feature the original LP album artwork released in the U.K., including the original printing of the group's debut, which used turquoise ink on the cover for the band's name and the Atlantic Records logo. Later printings used orange ink, making the first a rare collector's item. The orange sleeve is included with the boxed set as a bonus.\n\nLed Zeppelin III features the gatefold sleeve with the rotatable laminated card disc, while Physical Graffiti, which was nominated for a GrammyÃ‚Â® Award for best album package, features the interchanging window illustrations from the original LP jacket that included four covers made up of two inners, a middle insert cover and an outer cover.\n\nAdditionally, the set includes all six covers released for In Through the Out Door, Led Zeppelin's final studio album. Nominated for a GrammyÃ‚Â® Award for best album package, the In Through the Out Door covers feature different photos of the same bar scene taken from different perspectives.\n\n\nDefinitive Collection Mini LP Replica CD Box Set (2008):\n\nLed Zeppelin (1969)\nLed Zeppelin II (1969)\nLed Zeppelin III (1970)\nLed Zeppelin IV (1971)\nHouses of the Holy (1973)\nPhysical Graffiti (1975)\nPresence (1976)\nThe Song Remains the Same (1976)\nIn Through the Out Door (1979)\nCoda (1982)\n\n\nExtras:\n\nBBC Sessions (1997)\nHow the West Was Won (2003)\nMothership (2007)\n\n\nEach album has all the cover art included as well.
