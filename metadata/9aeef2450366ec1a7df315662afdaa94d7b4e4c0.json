Their enthusiasm turned this obscure Memphis pop band-one that got little airplay, sold few records, and only played a handful of times- into a remarkable rock and roll resurrection story. Big Star's trek from obscure Memphis band to standard bearers for an entire genre of music has never been fully mapped-until now. Rhino presents the definitive look at the definitive power-pop band with a four-disc boxed set divided between key cuts from Big Star's three studio albums and unreleased music. KEEP AN EYE ON THE SKY will be available September 15 from Rhino Records at all retail outlets, including www.rhino.com, for a suggested list price of $69.98 (physical), it will also be available as a digital release the same day. A Deluxe Edition release of Chris Bell's solo album I Am The Cosmos is due September 14 from Rhino Handmade.  \n  \nKEEP AN EYE ON THE SKY spans 1968 to 1975 and shows the progression of Big Star through selections from such studio precursors as Rock City and Icewater; music from Big Star's acclaimed recordings (#1 Record, Radio City, and Third/Sister Lovers); and relevant solo work by group principals Alex Chilton and Chris Bell, who formed Big Star in 1971 with bassist Andy Hummel and drummer Jody Stephens. The collection also uncovers a trove of unreleased demos, unused mixes, alternate versions of songs, and a 1973 concert recorded in Memphis.  \n  \nIn these 98 tracks you can hear what turned artists as diverse as Cheap Trick, R.E.M., and The Replacements into Big Star fans. Spotlighting the band's roots, the boxed set opens with several songs recorded before Big Star formed, including ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTry Again,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ one of the first songs Bell and Chilton wrote together. Those early cuts are followed by Big Star's 1972 debut #1 Record, reimagined here using a mix of album tracks and unreleased alternate mixes of favorites like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThirteen,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhen My Baby's Beside Me,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and more. Among the disc's rarities are ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCountry Morn'ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (issued as a flexi-disc single by a Big Star fanzine), the demo for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Got Kinda Lost,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and an unreleased acoustic demo of Chilton singing Loudon Wainwright's ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMotel Blues.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n  \nArdent Records, the band's label, experienced problems with distribution that hindered any chances at success for #1 Record. Its failure was a major blow to Bell, who quit the band to go solo. In 1974, the Alex Chilton-led Big Star regrouped and released Radio City, an album more attuned to the band's live energy that featured the power-pop confections ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSeptember GurlsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBack Of A Car.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The second disc of KEEP AN EYE ON THE SKY opens with a trio of unreleased demos: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThere Was A Light,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhat's Going Ahn,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLife Is White.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The original song sequence for Radio City follows, combining album versions with unreleased alternate mixes (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWay Out WestÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou Get What You Deserve.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) The disc features unissued versions of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShe A MoverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMod Lang,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ several unreleased demos for Big Star's third album, plus Bell's acclaimed 1978 single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Am The CosmosÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and its B-side ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou And Your Sister.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Sadly, Bell died in a car accident a few months after the single's release.  \n  \nWhen Big Star reconvened in 1975 to record Third/Sister Lovers, only Chilton and Stephens remained (Hummel left shortly before Radio City's release). Famed Memphis maverick Jim Dickinson was enlisted to supervise the recording, which languished on the shelf for years before its release in 1978. Despite its bleak timbre, wild dynamics, and fragility, the music possesses a startling grace. KEEP AN EYE ON THE SKY's third disc opens with seven demos (most previously unreleased) for songs that appear on Third/Sister Lovers, including ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJesus Christ,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTake Care,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHolocaust.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Among the album's 19 songs collected here is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFor You,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKizza Me,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKanga Roo.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Also featured is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLovely Day,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ an early, unreleased version of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStroke It NoelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with different lyrics; Chilton vamping with photographer Bill Eggleston at the piano for Nat King Cole's ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNature BoyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and a raucous cover of The Kinks' ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTill The End Of The Day.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  \n   \nThe collection's final disc contains unreleased highlights from three sets Big Star performed at Lafayette's Music Room in Memphis in January 1973. It is the best live recording ever of the band. The show captures Chilton, Hummel, and Stephens playing many of the songs on #1 Record, which had just recently been released. The set list includes a retooled version of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œST 100/6ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ lengthened by both guitar and drum solos (with a middle eight heisted from the Rock City song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Preacher.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) Also in the repertoire are ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThere Was A LightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Got Kinda Lost.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ In addition, the concert includes fully formed versions of several songs recorded later for Radio City: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBack Of A Car,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWay Out West,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œO My Soul,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and a particularly rocking ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShe's A Mover.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Those originals are mixed with a selection of covers: Todd Rundgren's ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSlut,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ T. Rex's ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBaby Strange,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The Kinks' ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCome On Now,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and The Flying Burrito Brothers' ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHot Burrito #2.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  \n  \nThe lavish packaging for KEEP AN EYE ON THE SKY includes extensive liner notes, rare and never-before-seen photos, and insightful essays about the cult of Big Star and the band's history. In the notes, Stephens reflects on the band's belated triumph. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSure, it would've been nice to have been huge at the time. But, here we are, 30 years later, and Big Star is still playing, our music is turning up in movie soundtracks, and young people are still excited to discover the records. I mean, if that isn't success, I don't know what is.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\n\n-- Disc 1 --\n\n   1.\n      Psychedelic Stuff ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Chris Bell [Original Mix]*\n   2.\n      All I See Is You ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Icewater\n   3.\n      Every Day As We Grow Closer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Alex Chilton [Original Mix]\n   4.\n      Try Again ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Rock City [Early Version]*\n   5.\n      Feel\n   6.\n      The Ballad Of El Goodo\n   7.\n      In The Street [Alternate Mix]*\n   8.\n      Thirteen [Alternate Mix]*\n   9.\n      DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Lie To Me\n  10.\n      The India Song [Alternate Mix]*\n  11.\n      When My BabyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Beside Me [Alternate Mix]*\n  12.\n      My Life Is Right [Alternate Mix]*\n  13.\n      Give Me Another Chance [Alternate Mix]*\n  14.\n      Try Again\n  15.\n      Gone With The Light *\n  16.\n      Watch The Sunrise [Single Version]\n  17.\n      ST 100/6 [Alternate Mix]*\n  18.\n      The Preacher ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Rock City [Excerpt]*\n  19.\n      In The Street [Alternate Single Mix]\n  20.\n      Feel [Alternate Mix]*\n  21.\n      The Ballad Of El Goodo [Alternate Lyrics]*\n  22.\n      The India Song [Alternate Version]*\n  23.\n      Country Mourn\n  24.\n      I Got Kinda Lost [Demo]\n  25.\n      Back Of A Car [Demo]\n  26.\n      Motel Blues [Demo]*\n\n-- Disc 2 --\n\n   1.\n      There Was A Light [Demo]*\n   2.\n      Life Is White [Demo]*\n   3.\n      WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Going Ahn [Demo]*\n   4.\n      O My Soul\n   5.\n      Life Is White\n   6.\n      Way Out West\n   7.\n      WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Going Ahn\n   8.\n      You Get What You Deserve\n   9.\n      Mod Lang [Alternate Mix]*\n  10.\n      Back Of A Car [Alternate Mix]*\n  11.\n      Daisy Glaze\n  12.\n      SheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s A Mover\n  13.\n      September Gurls\n  14.\n      Morpha Too [Alternate Mix]*\n  15.\n      IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m In Love With A Girl\n  16.\n      O My Soul [Alternate Version]*\n  17.\n      SheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s A Mover [Alternate Version]\n  18.\n      Daisy Glaze [Rehearsal Version]*\n  19.\n      I Am The Cosmos ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Chris Bell\n  20.\n      You And Your Sister ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Chris Bell\n  21.\n      Blue Moon [Demo]*\n  22.\n      Femme Fatale [Demo]*\n  23.\n      Thank You Friends [Demo]*\n  24.\n      Nightime [Demo]*\n  25.\n      Take Care [Demo]*\n  26.\n      You Get What You Deserve [Demo]*\n\n -- Disc 3 --\n\n   1.\n      Lovely Day [Demo]\n   2.\n      Downs [Demo]\n   3.\n      Jesus Christ [Demo]*\n   4.\n      Holocaust [Demo]*\n   5.\n      Big Black Car [Alternate Demo]*\n   6.\n      Manana *\n   7.\n      Jesus Christ\n   8.\n      Femme Fatale\n   9.\n      O, Dana\n  10.\n      Kizza Me\n  11.\n      You CanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Have Me\n  12.\n      Nightime\n  13.\n      Dream Lover\n  14.\n      Big Black Car\n  15.\n      Blue Moon\n  16.\n      Holocaust\n  17.\n      Stroke It Noel\n  18.\n      For You\n  19.\n      Downs\n  20.\n      Whole Lotta ShakinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ GoinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ On\n  21.\n      Kanga Roo\n  22.\n      Thank You Friends\n  23.\n      Take Care\n  24.\n      Lovely Day *\n  25.\n      Till The End Of The Day [Alternate Mix]*\n  26.\n      Nature Boy [Alternate Mix]*\n\n-- Disc 4: Live at LafayetteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Music Room, Memphis, TN * --\n\n   1.\n      When My BabyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Beside Me\n   2.\n      My Life Is Right\n   3.\n      SheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s A Mover\n   4.\n      Way Out West\n   5.\n      The Ballad Of El Goodo\n   6.\n      In The Street\n   7.\n      Back Of A Car\n   8.\n      Thirteen\n   9.\n      The India Song\n  10.\n      Try Again\n  11.\n      Watch The Sunrise\n  12.\n      DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Lie To Me\n  13.\n      Hot Burrito #2\n  14.\n      I Got Kinda Lost\n  15.\n      Baby Strange\n  16.\n      Slut\n  17.\n      There Was A Light\n  18.\n      ST 100/6\n  19.\n      Come On Now\n  20.\n      O My Soul\n\n    * Previously Unissued, including all of Disc 4.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9aeef2450366ec1a7df315662afdaa94d7b4e4c0","amp;dn":"Big+Star+-+Keep+An+Eye+On+The+Sky+%282009+Box+Set%2C+320+kpbs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9aeef2450366ec1a7df315662afdaa94d7b4e4c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,238,242,69,3,102,236,26,125,243,21,102,42,253,170,148,215,180,228,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
