For biology, computational techniques have led to enormous strides in our understanding of biological systems, but there is still vast territory to cover. Statistical physics especially holds great potential for elucidating the structural-functional relationships in biomolecules, as well as their static and dynamic properties. Breaking New Ground Computational Biology: A Statistical Mechanics Perspective is the first book dedicated to the interface between statistical physics and bioinformatics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22c634f40c7d85a7e02c4004263de8117be2e277","amp;dn":"Computational+Biology%3A+A+Statistical+Mechanics+Perspective","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22c634f40c7d85a7e02c4004263de8117be2e277","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,198,52,244,12,125,133,167,224,44,64,4,38,61,232,17,123,226,226,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
