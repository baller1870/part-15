Strutter\n          02. Nothin' To Lose\n          03. Firehouse\n          04. Cold Gin\n          05. Let Me Know\n          06. Kissin' Time\n          07. Deuce\n          08. Love Theme From Kiss\n          09. 100,000 Years\n          10. Black Diamond\n\nI originally recorded this album to digital about nine years ago. I recorded from a Marantz Gold Series turntable with diamond stylus, through a Roland CPM-120 amplifier (with cardioid capabilities) into a Fostex FD-8 (24-bit@48kHz). Initially, I remastered the material to CD from the Fostex, giving it analogue-style equalisation (in a digital environment).\n\nRecently, I ran the material off disc, through Sound Forge Pro version 10. I was able to clean it up further, doing tops and tails (the songs begin and end right on the money), removed pops and crackle, equalised it a bit further using Sony Xpress Graphic EQ (this sured up low bass and ultra trebles). Finally, I ran it through Nomad BluesTube Brickwall with a custom 'master mix leveller' that amplified and levelled to -0.4dB.\n\nI know it's a big folder, but for anyone who loves KISS, FLAC versions of albums or even just great audio remastered from vinyl, this is premium stuff. Final files are FLAC 24bit@96kHz.\n\nI've compared it to the FLAC version from CD (which I also have) and I find this remaster has more dynamics, psychoacoustics and is a lot warmer than the CD. I think I can safely delete the CDrip from my hard drive now!\n\nCheers,\nMoofieMan.\n\n\nThanks to all who seed - you are the lifeblood of the system","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f51953da1f804ba58e064e7f7d7cdfd9f1e7514","amp;dn":"Kiss+-+Kiss+%281974%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f51953da1f804ba58e064e7f7d7cdfd9f1e7514","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,81,149,61,161,248,4,186,88,224,100,231,247,215,205,253,159,30,117,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
