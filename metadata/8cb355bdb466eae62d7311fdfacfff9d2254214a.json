Edward Griffin - The Creature from Jekyll Island - A Second Look at the Federal Reserve 1998\r\n\r\nWhere does money come from? Where does it go? Who makes it? The money magicians' secrets are unveiled. We get a close look at their mirrors and smoke machines, their pulleys, cogs, and wheels that create the grand illusion called money. A dry and boring subject? Just wait!\r\nYou'll be hooked in five minutes. Reads like a detective story - which it really is. But it's all true. This book is about the most blatant scam of all history. It's all here: the cause of wars, boom-bust cycles, inflation, depression, prosperity.\r\n\r\nCreature from Jekyll Island is a &quot;must read.&quot; Your world view will definitely change. You'll never trust a politician again - or a banker","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cb355bdb466eae62d7311fdfacfff9d2254214a","amp;dn":"G.+Edward+Griffin+-+The+Creature+from+Jekyll+Island+-+A+Second+L","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cb355bdb466eae62d7311fdfacfff9d2254214a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,179,85,189,180,102,234,230,45,115,17,253,250,207,255,157,34,84,33,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
