The members of the independent company making it, including the director, Herbert J. Biberman, and the producer, Paul Jarrico, had been identified before the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities as past or present Communists and the organization sponsoring the picture, the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, had been expelled from the Congress of Industrial Organizations for left-wing leanings.\n\nIt tells the story of the struggles of miners in New Mexico against the injustices done to them by their bosses and the police. It deals with issues that were hardly touched upon at the time such as the discriminative practises against Mexican American workers and the issue of equal for women and their participation in public affairs. The company consists mostly of actual workers and their families with few professional actors.\n\nAn amazing film with great historical value that deals with issues that unfortunately remain very relevant to our world today.\n\n\n\nwww.freakyflicks.tk\n\nSEED AS LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...PLEASE!\n\n&amp;#039;If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, this torrent will NEVER DIE&amp;#039;\n\n... simply search for &amp;#039;freakyflicks&amp;#039;\n***************************************\n************** FREAKYFLICKS *************\n***************************************\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a43025456daf37082624b049f605c39bd902e345","amp;dn":"Herbert+J.+Biberman+-+Salt+of+the+Earth+%281954%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a43025456daf37082624b049f605c39bd902e345","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,48,37,69,109,175,55,8,38,36,176,73,246,5,195,155,217,2,227,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
