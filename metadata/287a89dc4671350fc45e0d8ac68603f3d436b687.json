It offers the latest advances in the research of analyzing and controlling dynamical systems with delays, which arise in many real-world problems. The contributions in this series are a collection across various disciplines, encompassing engineering, physics, biology, and economics, and some are extensions of those presented at the IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) conferences since 2011. The series is categorized in five parts covering the main themes of the contributions:\n\nÃ‚Â· Stability Analysis and Control Design\n\nÃ‚Â· Networks and Graphs\n\nÃ‚Â· Time Delay and Sampled-Data Systems\n\nÃ‚Â· Computational and Software Tools\n\nÃ‚Â· Applications\n\nThis volume will become a good reference point for researchers and PhD students in the field of delay systems, and for those willing to learn more about the field, and it will also be a resource for control engineers, who will find innovative control methodologies for relevant applications, from both theory and numerical analysis perspectives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:287a89dc4671350fc45e0d8ac68603f3d436b687","amp;dn":"Delay+Systems%3A+From+Theory+to+Numerics+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"287a89dc4671350fc45e0d8ac68603f3d436b687","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,122,137,220,70,113,53,15,196,94,13,138,198,134,3,243,212,54,182,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
