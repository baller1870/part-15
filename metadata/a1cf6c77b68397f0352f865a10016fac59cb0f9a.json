In some cases, this absence can be dangerous, but in others it can simply mean a different way of seeing the world.\n\nIn The Science of Evil Simon Baron-Cohen, an award-winning British researcher who has investigated psychology and autism for decades, develops a new brain-based theory of human cruelty. A true psychologist, however, he examines social and environmental factors that can erode empathy, including neglect and abuse.\n\nBased largely on Baron-Cohen's own research, The Science of Evil will change the way we understand and treat human cruelty.\n\n\n\n\n# Hardcover: 256 pages\n# Publisher: Basic Books (May 31, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0465023533\n# ISBN-13: 978-0465023530","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1cf6c77b68397f0352f865a10016fac59cb0f9a","amp;dn":"The+Science+of+Evil%3AOn+Empathy+and+the+Origins+of+Cruelty%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1cf6c77b68397f0352f865a10016fac59cb0f9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,207,108,119,182,131,151,240,53,47,134,90,16,1,111,172,89,203,15,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
