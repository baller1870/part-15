The group never added a bass player, and their sound was dominated by Manzarek's electric organ work and Morrison's deep, sonorous voice, with which he sang and intoned his highly poetic lyrics. The group signed to Elektra Records in 1966 and released its first album, The Doors, featuring the hit &quot;Light My Fire,&quot; in 1967. \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;searchlink=DOORS&amp;sql=11:wifqxqe5ldhe~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;searchlink=DOORS&amp;sql=11:wifqxqe5ldhe~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_at_the_Hollywood_Bowl_%28The_Doors_album%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_at_the_Hollywood_Bowl_%28The_Doors_album%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:02:22\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 544x416 1.31:1\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 877 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,16 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 184 Kbps\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9333d46796127449253281a9d85dd2eb014f5d9","amp;dn":"The+DOORS+-+LIVE+at+Holywood+Bowl+-1968","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9333d46796127449253281a9d85dd2eb014f5d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,51,61,70,121,97,39,68,146,83,40,26,157,133,221,46,176,20,245,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
