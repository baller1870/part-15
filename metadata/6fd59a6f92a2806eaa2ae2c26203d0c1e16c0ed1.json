The track is taken from Dre's debut solo album, album The Chronic, released via Death Row Records. The song was released as a single on May 20, 1993. \n\nThough not quite matching the popularity of Dre's earlier hit, &quot;Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang&quot;, the single still did well commercially managing to reach number eight on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart in June 1993 and number six, counting the 12 weeks spent, on the rap and hip-hop chart of that year's overall ranking. The song features a slowed-down interpolation of Funkadelic's &quot;(Not Just) Knee Deep&quot; as its bassline and features Jewell on vocals and RBX on chorus. An accompanying music video was directed by Dr. Dre.\n\nThe premise of the video concerns a parody character of Eazy-E called &quot;Sleazy-E&quot;, complete with a Jheri Curl hairstyle and wearing dark sunglasses, played by A.J. Johnson, getting a new contract from a man depicted as a fat, money-grubbing record producer, played by a real life executive producer from Interscope Records, Steve Berman (who was later featured on three Eminem skits and one D 12 skit). The story features Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg walking around and gaining a following from others around them. There is an interlude in the middle of the video, where Sleazy-E introduces his two new grotesque protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©s, played by Bushwick Bill and Warren G, to his new manager. Sleazy appears in a number of situations, including being shot, becoming homeless, being chased by armed men, and finally, on the Pasadena Freeway with a sign: &quot;Will Rap for Food&quot;. The same character appeared in the video for Eazy E's response, Real Muthaphuckkin G's. The video also parodies Luke Campbell as a gap toothed rapper. In April 2005 the video was 12th on MTV2 and XXL magazine's survey of the &quot;25 Greatest West Coast Videos&quot;.\n\nAndre Romelle Young (born February 18, 1965), known by his stage name Dr. Dre, is an American record producer, rapper and entrepreneur. He is the founder and current CEO of Aftermath Entertainment and Beats Electronics. Dre was previously the co-owner and artist of Death Row Records. He has produced albums for and overseen the careers of many rappers, including Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Knoc-turn'al, Xzibit, 50 Cent, The Game and more recently Kendrick Lamar. He is credited as a key figure in the popularization of West Coast G-funk, a style of rap music characterized as synthesizer-based with slow, heavy beats. In 2011, Dr. Dre was ranked as the third richest figure in the American hip hop scene by Forbes with a net worth of $250 million.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuck_wit_Dre_Day_(And_Everybody's_Celebratin')&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuck_wit_Dre_Day_(And_Everybody's_Celebratin')&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/iAnLHAAeM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/iAnLHAAeM&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 9800kbps\n   Audio: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Duration: 00:06:13\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
