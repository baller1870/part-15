Here's the first of the ten hottest records of the week; K.C. &amp; The Sunshine Band and 'Please Don't Go'.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nThe artist formerly known as John Cougar has his first top 40 hit, &quot;I Need A Lover&quot; (at number 39).\n\nA listener wants to know if any number one song has ever hit number one again as a remake. Casey says it has happened three times. Twice, the songs were written by the same duo.\n\nOne band in the countdown has played on over 200 gold albums. After 27 years they are finally on the chart with their own first hit.\n\nOne singer in the countdown has been a balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.\n\nThere is a man in the countdown whose first album in 1961 cost only $400 to produce, and it never stopped selling.\n\nCasey explains how many copies a hit record has to sell to hit number one and how Billboard determines that a record has hit number one. He says they use a computer.\n\nAn American Air Force couple stationed in Germany wants to know if any Germans have ever made the top 40. Casey says four German recording acts have hit the top 40 and two have made it to number one.
