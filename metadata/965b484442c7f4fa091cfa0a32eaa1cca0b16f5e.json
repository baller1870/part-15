The South Bend date was originally issued in 2003 by Follow That Dream, but &quot;Killing Me Softly With His Song&quot; and some stage dialogue were omitted, and the closing vamp was clipped.\n\n Though ElvisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ personal problems were affecting some of his shows around this time, he seemed to be in fine fettle in South Bend. Overall, this show presents a solid and pleasing performance by Elvis, and though it has been released before, we can now enjoy a more complete and -- most importantly - sonically superior recording of this concert!\n\n The August 16, 1974 rehearsal surfaced on bootleg compact disc in 1995, then officially fourteen years later on Follow That Dream. For the first time, Audionics presents these songs as originally recorded, in binaural stereo; and the sound is better than ever before. Unfortunately, the entire tape is unavailable, but all the essential performances are here. It is a real pleasure to listen tracks like &quot;Softly As I Leave You&quot; and &quot;Twelfth Of Never&quot; in binaural form.\n\n &quot;AUTUMN GOLD&quot; is presented in a great-looking 2-disc digipak with a 20-page booklet filled with photographs taken that night in South Bend and at additional live shows and candids from March, August and October 1974.\n All these recordings have been carefully engineered to be presented in the best possible sound.\n \nEnjoy!\n\nTCB,\nJeroep","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:965b484442c7f4fa091cfa0a32eaa1cca0b16f5e","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+Autumn+gold+-2cd-+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"965b484442c7f4fa091cfa0a32eaa1cca0b16f5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,91,72,68,66,199,244,250,9,28,250,10,50,234,161,204,160,177,111,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
