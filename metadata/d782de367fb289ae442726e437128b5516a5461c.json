They greatly increase the efficiency of nutrient and water uptake, enhance resistance to pathogens, and buffer plant species against several environmental stresses and drought resistance. Mycorrhizae also improve plant growth and survival in soils contaminated by heavy metals. This book emphasizes the biotechnological application of mycorrhizae to promote the production of food while maintaining ecologically and economically sustainable production systems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d782de367fb289ae442726e437128b5516a5461c","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2010%5D+Mycorrhizal+Biotechnology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d782de367fb289ae442726e437128b5516a5461c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,130,222,54,127,178,137,174,68,39,38,228,55,18,139,85,22,165,70,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
