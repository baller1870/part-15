But that's not to say that the Black Keys are blues traditionalists: even on their 2002 debut, The Big Come Up, they covered the Beatles' psychedelic classic ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£She Said She Said,ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ indicating a fascination with sound and texture that would later take hold on such latter-day albums as 2008's Attack &amp; Release, where guitarist Dan Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney teamed up with sonic architect Danger Mouse. In between those two records, the duo established the Black Keys as a rock &amp; roll band with a brutal, primal force, and songwriters of considerable depth, as evidenced on such fine albums as 2003's Thickfreakness and 2004's Rubber Factory.\n\n  Natives of Akron, Ohio, the Black Keys released their debut, The Big Come Up, in 2002, receiving strong reviews and sales, and leading to a contract with Fat Possum by the end of the year. That label released Thickfreakness, recorded in a 14-hour session, in the spring of 2003, and the Keys supported the album with an opening tour for Sleater-Kinney. the Black Keys' momentum escalated considerably with their 2004 album Rubber Factory, which not only received strong reviews but some high-profile play, including a video for ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£10 A.M. AutomaticÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ featuring comedian David Cross. The band's highly touted live act was documented on a 2005 DVD, released the same year as Chulahoma -- an EP of blues covers -- appeared.\n\n  The Black Keys made the leap to the major labels with 2006's Magic Potion, a moodier record that continued to build their fan base. The band capitalized on that moodiness with 2008's Attack &amp; Release, whose production by Danger Mouse signaled that the Black Keys were hardly just blues-rock purists. Salvaged from sessions intended as a duet album with Ike Turner, who died before the record could be finished, the album was the Black Keys' biggest to date, debuting in the Billboard Top 15 and earning strong reviews. Following their second live DVD, the Black Keys spent 2009 on side projects, with Auerbach releasing his solo album Keep It Hid in the beginning of the year, and Carney forming the band Drummer, in which he played bass. At the end of 2009, Blakroc, a rap-rock collaboration between the band and producer Damon Dash, appeared.\n\n  Brothers, released in 2010, became their biggest album yet, generating the hit singles &quot;Tighten Up,&quot; &quot;Howlin' for You&quot; and &quot;Next Girl.&quot; It also saw the Keys returning to their tough blues roots with a new grandness, earning three Grammy Awards, landing on year-end lists from NPR to Rolling Stone, and going gold. The band offered a more straight-ahead rock &amp; roll sound with 2011's El Camino. On the strength of the hit single &quot;Lonely Boy,&quot; El Camino debuted at number 2 on Billboard's Top 200 and the Black Keys worked the album hard throughout the next year, releasing &quot;Gold on the Ceiling&quot; as the record's second single and touring heavily. In the fall of 2012, the Tour Rehearsal Tapes EP -- a brief collection of live-in-the-studio run-throughs of 2012 material -- was released.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c5b560497fbb16d10f06e7b00508f11e9219c7c","amp;dn":"The+Black+Keys+24+Bit+Vinyl+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c5b560497fbb16d10f06e7b00508f11e9219c7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,91,86,4,151,251,177,109,16,240,110,123,0,80,143,17,233,33,156,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
