In 1931, Billy\n                keeps his stranglehold on Walter, with another job\n                lined up as a look out. A nervous Walter agrees, but\n                bottles it at the last minute, angering Billy even\n                more. And in 2011, Ellie's single-minded focus on her\n                own child is still making things tense with Nick, who\n                has also just discovered that Poppy is on the pill,\n                and he looks for stress release with his AA sponsor,\n                Lynne.\n\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n\n                Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74fd0d409a9ed812af8698ffa9275c7811c015f2","amp;dn":"32.Brinkburn.Street.S01E03.HDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74fd0d409a9ed812af8698ffa9275c7811c015f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,253,13,64,154,158,216,18,175,134,152,255,169,39,92,120,17,192,21,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
