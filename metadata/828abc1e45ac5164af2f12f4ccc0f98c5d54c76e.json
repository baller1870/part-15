The album features jazz artists: McCoy Tyner, Joe Henderson, Hank Mobley, James Spaulding and more. All original works by Hubbard, the tracks form a dark and spiritually driven album.\n\n\n Freddie Hubbard's last Blue Note release of the 1960s (with the exception of the blowing session The Night of the Cookers), adds two numbers to the original LP program and features the great trumpeter in three challenging settings ranging from a sextet to an octet. Hubbard uses such sidemen as altoist James Spaulding, tenors Joe Henderson and Hank Mobley, the euphonium of Kiane Zawadi, pianists Harold Mabern, McCoy Tyner and Herbie Hancock, bassists Larry Ridley, Bob Cranshaw and Reggie Workman, drummers Clifford Jarvis, Pete La Roca and Elvin Jones, the congas of Big Black and on one song bassoonist Hosea Taylor. The set is comprised of seven diverse Hubbard originals and, even though none of the songs caught on to become standards, the music is quite challenging and fairly memorable.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Soul Surge\n 02 - Blue Spirits\n 03 - Outer Forces\n 04 - Cunga Black\n 05 - Jodo\n\n Produced Alfred Lion.\n Recorded February 19 &amp; 26, 1965 at Van Gelder Studio in Englewood Cliffs, NJ.\n\nMusicians:\n Freddie Hubbard - trumpet\n James Spaulding - alto saxophone, flute\n Joe Henderson, Hank Mobley - tenor saxophone\n Harold Mabern, McCoy Tyner - piano\n Larry Ridley, Bob Cranshaw - bass\n Clifford Jarvis, Pete LaRoca - drums\n Big Black - congas\n Kiane Zawadi - euphonium","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:828abc1e45ac5164af2f12f4ccc0f98c5d54c76e","amp;dn":"Freddie+Hubbard+-+Blue+Spirits+%281965%2F2015%29+24%2F192","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"828abc1e45ac5164af2f12f4ccc0f98c5d54c76e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,138,188,30,69,172,81,100,175,47,18,244,204,192,249,140,93,84,199,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
