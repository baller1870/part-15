R Martin to life, without making any serious changes to the standard Mount and Blade: Warband gameplay.\n\nAs I am the only person working on it, it does not currently contain any &quot;original&quot; models nor textures. The new armors and miscellaneous items that you might find in-game are all OSP, with the odd recoloring and retexturing.\n\nAs it is also a work in progress, I imagine that there will be a few bugs. I have eliminated most of them myself, and have not experienced any crashes while playing for quite some time. But still, it's currently a beta, remember that. \n\n\nTo install this modification, simply extract the file &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; into your steam/steamapps/common/mountblade warband/Module folder.\n\nFor more information go to: http://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php?topic=194610.0 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:096671d021a3dc3707a6ab6bf861d9bf14d49b26","amp;dn":"Clash+of+Kings+Mod+0.4+for+Mount+%26amp%3B+Blade+Warband","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"096671d021a3dc3707a6ab6bf861d9bf14d49b26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,102,113,208,33,163,220,55,7,166,171,107,248,97,217,191,20,212,155,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
