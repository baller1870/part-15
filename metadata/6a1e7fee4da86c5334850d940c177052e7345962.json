In the first part of the century, bands were popular with audiences across the country, but as recordings became available, nearly every popular recording artist was a vocalist, not a group. Alabama was the group that made country bands popular again. Emerging in the late '70s, the band had roots in both country and rock; in fact, many of Alabama's musical concepts, particularly the idea of a performing band, owed more to rock and pop than hardcore country. However, there is no denying that Alabama is a country band -- the bandmembers' pop instincts may come from rock, but their harmonies, songwriting, and approach are indebted to country, particularly the Bakersfield sound of Merle Haggard, bluegrass, and the sound of Nashville pop. A sleek, country-rock sound made the group the most popular country group in history, selling more records than any other artist of the '80s and earning stacks of awards.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tCountry\t\t\t\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tRCA\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.My Home's In Alabama\n02.Feels So Right\n03.Love In The First Degree\n04.Dixieland Delight\n05.Roll On (Eighteen Wheeler)\n06.There's No Way\n07.The Closer You Get\n08.Forever's As Far As I'll Go\n09.Give Me One More Shot\n10.In Pictures\n\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a1e7fee4da86c5334850d940c177052e7345962","amp;dn":"Alabama+-+Super+Hits+%281996%29+%5BCDRip%5D+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a1e7fee4da86c5334850d940c177052e7345962","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,30,127,238,77,168,108,83,52,133,13,148,12,23,112,82,231,52,89,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
