In this user-friendly workshop, author and trainer Chad Chelius demystifies XHTML code, showing you the building blocks of a web pageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s content, and explains the role that cascading style sheets (CSS) play in building web pages. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to gain complete control over the appearance of your web pages and how to work with links, graphics, and alt text. Finally, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see how to upload your files to a server, add meta tags, and test your website, and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll even get a glimpse of the future of the web: HTML5 and CSS3. \n\n\nInfo: https://www.video2brain.com/en/courses/getting-started-with-xhtml-and-css\n\nPlease SEED after you download so I get free to upload the next release.
