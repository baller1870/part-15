Myst puts the player in the role of the Stranger, who uses a special book to travel to the island of Myst. There, the player uses other special books written by an artisan and explorer named Atrus to travel to several worlds known as &quot;Ages&quot;. Clues found in each of these Ages help to reveal the back-story of the game's characters. The game has several endings, depending on the course of action the player takes.\n\nUpon release, Myst was a surprise hit, with critics lauding the ability of the game to immerse players in the fictional world. The game was the best-selling PC game until The Sims exceeded its sales in 2002. Myst's success spawned four direct video game sequels as well as several spin-off games and novels.\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\n+ Windows 3.1; or Windows 95\n+ 386DX 33 MHz (486 recommended)\n+ 4MB of RAM (8MB recommended) for Windows 3.1\n+ 8MB RAM for Windows 95\n+ Super VGA (640 x 480. 256 colors)-with compatible drivers\n+ Windows sound device-with compatible drivers\n+ CD-ROM drive (double-speed drive or higher recommended)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a678bb9bd08079001975fc4bfbde78c35f72150","amp;dn":"Myst","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a678bb9bd08079001975fc4bfbde78c35f72150","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,103,139,185,189,8,7,144,1,151,95,196,191,189,231,140,53,247,33,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
