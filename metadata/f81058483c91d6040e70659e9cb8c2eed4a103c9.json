Bridget has her own set of rigid rules when it comes to men. She prefers to avoid them altogether, especially dangerously seductive auburn haired emerald eyed players like Justin.\n\nBut the new lead singer of the rising rock band Tempest doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like to be ignored. Justin is used to getting what he wants, and now heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s set his sights on Bridget.\n\nSuddenly, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no longer a game.\n\nWhat do you do when the one you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have turns out to be the one you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t live without?\n\nAs the pressure builds, will it temper them or will it shatter them both like fragile crystal?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f81058483c91d6040e70659e9cb8c2eed4a103c9","amp;dn":"Michelle+Mankin+-+Tempest+series+02-+Enticing+Interlude","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f81058483c91d6040e70659e9cb8c2eed4a103c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,16,88,72,60,145,214,4,14,112,101,158,156,184,194,238,212,161,3,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
