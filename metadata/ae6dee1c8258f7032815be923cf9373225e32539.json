This trend has continued and intensifiedÃ¢â‚¬â€natural products are again under the spotlight, in particular for their possible pharmacological applications. Largely focusing on natural products as lead compounds in drug discovery, Bioactive Compounds from Natural Sources, Second Edition: Natural Products as Lead Compounds in Drug Discovery is actually a completely new volume containing surveys of selected recent advances in an interdisciplinary area covering chemistry of natural products, medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, and other related topics.\nWritten by some of the most reputed scientists in the field, this second edition includes new chapters from authors who contributed to the first edition as well as many chapters compiled by new authors. Introducing the reader to strategies and methods in the search for bioactive natural products, this book covers topics including:\n-    Natural sources of bioactive compounds such as aquatic cyanobacteria, filamentous fungi, and tropical plants,\n-    The tremendous potentiality of metabolic engineering of natural products biosynthesis\n-    The contribution of emerging or developing technologies to the study of bioactive natural compounds, namely computational methods and circular dichroism\n-    The potential of natural or natural-derived compounds for specific therapeutic applications: treatment of viral diseases, regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor, antimalarials, modulation of angiogenesis, and antitumor and wound-healing activity\n-    Selected examples of natural product families and related synthetic analogues, namely polyphenols and campthotecins\nCompiled for researchers and Ph.D. students working in interdisciplinary fields, this book will also be appreciated by readers without a background in chemistry interested in bioactive natural products, their biological and pharmacological properties, and their possible use as chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic agents. Conversely, the biological and pharmacological data and methods are accessible by chemists.\n\nAbout the Author\nProfessor Corrado Tringali obtained his BA in chemistry at the University of Catania, Italy, in 1973. From 1977 to 1985 he was an assistant professor, teaching courses in organic chemistry and physical methods in organic chemistry. In November 1985 he became an associate professor (organic chemistry), and since November 2001 he has been a full professor (teaching courses in organic chemistry, natural products chemistry, and physical methods in organic chemistry). At present, he is coordinator of the international Doctorate of Research in Chemical Science program at the University of Catania\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface.....................ix\nEditor.............................xi\nContributors............... xiii\nChapter 1 Strategies.and.Methods.for.a.Sustainable.Search.for.Bioactive.Compounds..........1\nChapter 2 Discovery.of.Potential.Anticancer.Agents.from.Aquatic.Cyanobacteria,.Filamentous.Fungi,.and.Tropical.Plants.....37\nChapter 3 Metabolic.Engineering.of.Natural.Product.Biosynthesis....................65\nChapter 4 Computational.Approaches.for.the.Discovery.of.Natural.Lead Structures.......97\nChapter 5 Recent.Advances.in.the.Application.of.Electronic.Circular.Dichroism.for.Studies.of.Bioactive.Natural.Products.......... 133\nChapter 6 Natural.Products.as.Treatments.for.and.Leads.to.Active.Compounds.in.Viral.Diseases....... 167\nChapter 7 Natural.Products.as.Inhibitors.of.Hypoxia-Inducible.Factor-1......... 187\nChapter 8 Antitumor.or.Wound.Healing.Actions.of.Natural.Products.through.Inhibiting.or.Enhancing.Angiogenesis..........265\nChapter 9 From.Natural.Polyphenols.to.Synthetic.Antitumor.Agents..............299\nChapter 10 Resveratrol.against.Major.Pathologies:.From.Diet.Prevention.to Possible.Alternative.Chemotherapies.with New.Structural Analogues...............339\nChapter 11 Drug.Discovery.from Natural.Substances:.A Case StudyÃ¢â‚¬â€ Camptothecins............ 379\nChapter 12 Plant.Compounds.and.Derivatives.as.Inhibitors.of.Cancer.Cell.Multidrug.Resistance..........409\nChapter 13 Recent.Advances.in.the.Search.of.Novel.Calmodulin.Inhibitors.from.Selected.Mexican.Plants.and.Fungi............. 451\nChapter 14 Neuroprotective.Effects.of.Natural.Products.from.Traditional.Chinese.Herbs............497\nChapter 15 Drugs.for.the.Neglected.Disease.Malaria.Based.on Natural Products......... 525\nChapter 16 Endophytic.Microorganisms.as.a.Source.of Bioactive Compounds.........551\nChapter 17 Biologically.Active.Natural.Products.from.Australian.Marine Organisms........... 579\nNatural Source Index..................603\nSubject Index......................607","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae6dee1c8258f7032815be923cf9373225e32539","amp;dn":"Bioactive+Compounds+from+Natural+Sources+%282nd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae6dee1c8258f7032815be923cf9373225e32539","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,109,238,28,130,88,247,3,40,21,190,146,60,249,55,50,37,227,37,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
