The album included three singles which had never appeared on earlier albums (&quot;Motown Junk,&quot; &quot;Suicide Is Painless,&quot; and &quot;The Masses Against the Classes&quot;), the latter being one of the band's two UK #1 hits, along with &quot;If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next.&quot; Several songs were edited for length (&quot;Motorcycle Emptiness,&quot; &quot;You Love Us&quot;, &quot;Australia,&quot; &quot;Everything Must Go,&quot; &quot;Little Baby Nothing,&quot; and &quot;The Everlasting&quot;) so that more tracks could fit onto the CD (though not listed as edits in the liner notes). The album entered the UK Album Chart at No.4.\n\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] A Design For Life\n[02] Motorcycle Emptiness\n[03] If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next\n[04] La Tristesse Durera (Scream To A Sigh)\n[05] There By The Grace Of God\n[06] You Love Us\n[07] Australia\n[08] You Stole The Sun From My Heart\n[09] Kevin Carter\n[10] Tsunami\n[11] The Masses Against The Classes\n[12] From Despair To Where\n[13] Door To The River\n[14] Everything Must Go\n[15] Faster\n[16] Little Baby Nothing\n[17] Suicide Is Painless (Theme From Mash)\n[18] So Why So Sad\n[19] The Everlasting\n[20] Motown Junk\n\n\tCD-01 Play Time - 01h:18m:45s\n\nCD-02 Track Listings\n\n[01] La Tristesse Durera (Scream To A Sigh) (The Chemical Brothers Remix)\n[02] If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next (David Holmes Remix)\n[03] Tsunami (Cornelius Remix)\n[04] So Why So Sad (Avalanches Remix)\n[05] Faster (The Chemical Brothers Remix)\n[06] If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next (Massive Attack Remix)\n[07] Kevin Carter (Jon Carter Remix)\n[08] You Stole The Sun From My Heart (David Holmes Remix)\n[09] Tsunami (Stereolab Remix)\n[10] Let Robeson Sing (Ian Brown Remix)\n[11] The Everlasting (Stealth Sonic Orchestra Remix)\n[12] You Stole The Sun From My Heart (Mogwai Remix)\n[13] A Design For Life (Stealth Sonic Orchestra Remix)\n\n\tCD-02 Play Time - 01h:17m:11s\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time............ 02h:35m:58s \nTotal File Size....................... 1.05GBs (Including FLACs, Videos, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
