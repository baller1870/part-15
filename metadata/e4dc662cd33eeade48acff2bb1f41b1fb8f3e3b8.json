The duos trademark fusion of progressive techno has always pushed the sonic boundaries of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conventional electronic music confines, and has always been aimed at the dancefloor. So I was curious as to whether or not it would be an album comprised primarily of club oriented tracks or if there would be a wider variance of material. It is certainly the former and given the limitations of an hour plus collection of music it can be a very hard thing to pull off. Nanoplex have really succeeded here though and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve also called on their friends Tripswitch and Neurodriver for some brilliant collaborative material.\n...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4dc662cd33eeade48acff2bb1f41b1fb8f3e3b8","amp;dn":"Nanoplex+-+The+Billion+Dollar+Brain+%282014%29+Album+%40+MP3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4dc662cd33eeade48acff2bb1f41b1fb8f3e3b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,220,102,44,211,62,234,222,72,172,255,43,177,244,27,31,184,243,227,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
