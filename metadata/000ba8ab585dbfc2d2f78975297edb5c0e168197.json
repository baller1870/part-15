But she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t miss the funeral of the aunt who took her in and loved her in spite of the mess she made of her high school years.\n\nCole McKenna is the guy Bailey dreads meeting the most. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the love of her youth whom she treated so shamefully when her life started going off the rails 10 years ago.\n\nCole, for his part, is surprised at how deep and strong his feelings for Bailey still are. But somehow he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get through to the beautiful doctoral grad who still sees herself, in this place at least, as Easy Bay Lay.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:000ba8ab585dbfc2d2f78975297edb5c0e168197","amp;dn":"Dani+Pettrey-Submerged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"000ba8ab585dbfc2d2f78975297edb5c0e168197","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,11,168,171,88,93,191,194,210,247,137,117,41,126,219,92,14,22,129,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
