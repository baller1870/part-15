It also helped establish his membership in the legendary Hip Hop crew D.I.T.C., which includes Lord Finesse, Showbiz &amp; A.G., Diamond D, Fat Joe, Big L and Buckwild, who produced the majority of this album.\n\nThe album is most remembered because of the single &quot;Time's Up&quot;. The instrumental to the track was used for a battle in the hit movie 8 Mile. The song was a scathing accusation, pointed at thug-posturers who were flooding the hip hop scene at the time. Vocal clips from the song have been sampled in numerous hip hop tracks throughout the years; Including Mos Def's 'Hip Hop' off of his 1998 album Black on Both Sides and Big L's 'The Enemy', which appears on his posthumous album The Big Picture.\n\nTrack listing\n#\tTitle\tSongwriters\tProducer(s)\tPerformer (s)\n1\t&quot;Creative Control&quot;\tO.
