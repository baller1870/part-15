Working with Quincy Jones since 1976, Every Home Should Have One was her long-awaited solo album with Jones as a producer. The hit singles &quot;Do You Love Me&quot; and &quot;Every Home Should Have One&quot; are polished -- pleasing but derivative. Rod Temperton -- who did four songs here, including the smooth &quot;The Genie&quot; -- comes up with a true gem, the classic Austin and James Ingram duet &quot;Baby Come to Me.&quot; The most telling aspect of Every Home Should Have One isn&amp;#039;t the L.A. pop/R&amp;B Austin could do standing on her head, it&amp;#039;s the most meditative offerings. A cover of Thom Bell and Linda Creed&amp;#039;s &quot;Stop, Look and Listen&quot; gets an effortless treatment. The album-closing &quot;The Island,&quot; with music from Ivan Lins and Vitor Martins and lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman, seems best suited for Austin as she gives a sensual and flawless reading. Every Home Should Have One doesn&amp;#039;t possess Quincy Jones&amp;#039; all-encompassing production style of albums like The Dude and George Benson&amp;#039;s Give Me the Night. While this seems like a debut album, it&amp;#039;s far from it, but it&amp;#039;s a perfect introduction to Austin and her more pop-orientated work. ~ Jason Elias, All Music Guide\n\n\nPersonnel:\nChris Parker  - Drums\nRichard Tee -Piano, Keyboards, Piano (Electric)\nRod Temperton -Synthesizer\nEddie Watkins -Bass\nErnie Watts -Sax (Tenor)\nDavid Foster -Synthesizer\nRalph MacDonald -Percussion, Percussion Arrangement\nEric Gale -Guitar\nPatti Austin - Vocals, Main Performer\nJames Ingram -Vocals, Performer, Vocals (Background)\nBob James -Synthesizer, Keyboards, Piano\nQuincy Jones -Producer\n\nTrack Listing:\n1  Do You Love Me  \t(3:24)  \t   \t\n2 Love Me to Death \t(4:08) \t\t\n3 TheWay I Feel \t(4:19) \t\t\n4 Every Home Should Have One  (3:24) \t\t\n5 Baby, Come to Me \t(3:30) \t\t\n6 TheGenie (3:57) \t\t \n7 Stop, Look, Listen (To Your Heart) (3:07) \t\t \n8 Symphony of Love \t(3:39) \t\t \n9 Oh No, Margarita \t(3:52) \t\t \n10 The Island","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ec8507869d733f935ff68ccb40dbb37e34cddbe","amp;dn":"Patti+Austin-Every+Home+Should+Have+One+%281981%29+RESEED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ec8507869d733f935ff68ccb40dbb37e34cddbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,200,80,120,105,215,51,249,53,255,104,204,180,13,187,55,227,76,221,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
