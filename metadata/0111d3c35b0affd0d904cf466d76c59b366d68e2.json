And these words, phrases and verses are important.\n\nHow important are these missing words, phrases and verses and how can you know for sure whether your Bible is defective? That's what this book will show you.\nIn Part One you will see how important it is that your Bible shows you every single word of God, translated correctly into your language. Your Bible is seriously flawed when those words are missing. They are no longer the words of God. They are only the words of men. You will see how many of the newer Bibles have sneaky little notes that actually place doubt in what God said. Then you will learn what is really taught to your pastors, teachers and your children in Bible College. You will see for yourself why those students come out less sure of God s words and more filled with doubt. Many people have begun to see the errors in the NIV. But not only the NIV has errors.\n\nSo Part Two will give you a quick overview of 15 of the best-known Bible versions, with a small sampling of what is missing in each of them.\n\nPart Three is a select list of 257 verses. It will show you which of those 40 Bible versions are missing important words, phrases and verses. You will be shocked. The point is simple. When you find out for yourself what is missing, and what is at stake, you will be ready and able to discern which Bible is God s words, and which are the devil's clever counterfeits.\n\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDavid Daniels, B.A., M.Div., is trained in Bible, theology and linguistics. After twenty years of searching the Hebrew and Greek scriptures and studying the history of the Bible, he concluded that the King James Bible is God's preserved words in English. He is currently Research Consultant for Chick Publications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0111d3c35b0affd0d904cf466d76c59b366d68e2","amp;dn":"Look+What%27s+Missing+-+David+W.+Daniels","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0111d3c35b0affd0d904cf466d76c59b366d68e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,17,211,195,91,10,255,208,217,4,207,70,109,118,197,155,54,109,104,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
