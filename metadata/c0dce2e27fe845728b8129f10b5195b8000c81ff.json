Dozer guitarist Tommi Holappa and drummer Karl Daniel LidÃ©n with bassist Bengt BÃ¤cke (who also engineered Dozerâ€˜s earliest demos), Greenleaf released their first EP in 2000, working with the simple ethic of paying homage to â€™70s rock. \r\n\r\nThen fronted by Peder Bergstrand of the still-underrated Lowrider, it would be Dozerâ€˜s own Fredrik Nordin in the vocal role for 2001â€™s Revolution Rock full-length debut, and that lineup would be joined by Demon Cleaner guitarist Daniel Jansson for their Small Stone Records sophomore outing, 2003â€™s Secret Alphabets.\r\n\r\nYear:\t2016\r\nStyle:\tStoner Metal\r\n\r\nAdditional:\tHard Rock\r\nCountry:\tSweden\r\n\r\nFormat:\t256 mp3\r\nSize:\t89.67 MB\r\n\r\n\t\r\nAdded:\t18/02/2016 \r\nFiles:\t10\r\n\r\nDescription:\t\r\n\r\nLength : 0:43:01\r\n\r\n\r\nTracks :\r\n\r\n01.
