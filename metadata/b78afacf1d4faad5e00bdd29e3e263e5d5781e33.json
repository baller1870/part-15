NHK devoted 17 years to the planning, shooting and production of The Silk Road, which unearthed trade routes linking long-lost civilizations of East and West. A landmark in broadcasting history, this series told the story of the rise and fall of ancient civilizations.\nThe NHK Tokushu and China's CCTV documentary series The Silk Road began on April 7, 1980. The program started with the memorable scene of a camel caravan crossing the desert against the setting sun, with Kitaro's music and a sense of timelessness. It was the start of an epic televisual poem.\nThe first journey described in the series began in Chang'an (now Xi'an), at the eastern end of the ancient route. On 450,000 feet of film, the NHK crew recorded the path westward to the Pamir Heights at the Pakistan border and this material was edited to make 12 monthly broadcasts. In response to viewers' requests that the series be extended to cover the Silk Road all the way to Rome, sequels were made over the next 10 years. Seventeen years after the program was conceived, the project was completed.\n\n\n\n8)  A Heat Wave Called Turfan \nThe oasis cities of Hami and Turfan suffered attacks by Huns, but also enjoyed the peaceful co-living of diverse ethnic groups.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img9/1474/thesilkroadiscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img9/1474/thesilkroadiscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img818/7227/thesilkroadiscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img818/7227/thesilkroadiscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img196/8035/thesilkroadiscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img196/8035/thesilkroadiscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img855/1928/thesilkroadiscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img855/1928/thesilkroadiscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img842/2165/thesilkroadiscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img842/2165/thesilkroadiscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img268/8060/thesilkroadiscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img268/8060/thesilkroadiscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img42/1635/thesilkroadiscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img42/1635/thesilkroadiscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img442/2752/thesilkroadiscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img442/2752/thesilkroadiscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img189/1649/thesilkroadiscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img189/1649/thesilkroadiscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img267/7531/thesilkroadiscreen9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img267/7531/thesilkroadiscreen9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img253/7229/thesilkroadiscreen10.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img253/7229/thesilkroadiscreen10.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img820/8192/thesilkroadiscreen11.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img820/8192/thesilkroadiscreen11.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2073 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x552\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.304:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 48:15.822\nNumber Of Parts: 12\nPart Size: 786 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b78afacf1d4faad5e00bdd29e3e263e5d5781e33","amp;dn":"NHK+The+Silk+Road+I+08of12+A+Heat+Wave+Called+Turfan+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b78afacf1d4faad5e00bdd29e3e263e5d5781e33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,138,250,207,29,79,170,213,224,11,221,41,227,226,99,229,213,120,30,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
