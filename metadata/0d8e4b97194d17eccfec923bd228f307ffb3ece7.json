Sublime silent comedy, one of Buster&amp;#039;s best, with a genuinely hair-raising finale. Incidentally, Buster married his leading lady in real life.\n\nMaltin includes it in his 100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century List, along with Keaton&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;The General&amp;#039; (1927).\n\n(http://www.filmsite.org/maltin.html)\n\nNotes from Wikipedia:\n\nKeaton set the film in the 1830s so he could indulge his passion for trains by creating a working model of Stephenson&amp;#039;s Rocket, the first locomotive.\n\nThe Canfield-McKay feud is an obvious satire of the real-life Hatfield-McCoy feud.\n\nDuration: 1:13:17\n\nDimensions: 416 x 320\n\nVideo Codec: DivX 5.0.2\n\nAudio Codec: MP3, VBR\n\nGood Quality DVDRip\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d8e4b97194d17eccfec923bd228f307ffb3ece7","amp;dn":"Our+Hospitality+%5BBuster+Keaton%5D+%281923%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d8e4b97194d17eccfec923bd228f307ffb3ece7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,142,75,151,25,77,23,236,207,236,146,59,210,40,243,7,255,179,236,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
