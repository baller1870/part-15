Back with what most YES fans would consider to be\nthe classic line up of Rick Wakeman, Jon Anderson, Steve Howe, Chris Squire and Alan\nWhite, the band has never been in better shape musically.\n\nAs might be deduced from the title of this DVD, it is not a straight ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“live in concertÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ affair,\nthough music and footage of the tour feature throughout. This top-notch production is split\ninto a series of ten ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“chaptersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢; the band members talk about the music and tell us their\nthoughts about the past, present and future in an informal and often amusing manner. Rick\ntells us his reasons for leaving the band on a couple of occasions and expresses his views on\nTopographic Oceans (well said that man!) and casts a humorous aspersion regarding a blow\nup doll; Steve tells us that he has slept with his beloved Gibson guitar though he doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t\nmention the chat up lines used; Alan was a pianist before he became a drummer, and talks\nabout how that influences his playing; Chris recalls the time when he mimed to a Beatles\nnumber in front of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“an audience; and Jon concludes that the reason the band has survived the\nchanging fashions in music in because of their ever live presence. This last point makes a lot\nof sense. The best way to promote music is to regularly perform live. That way, in the\nabsence of airplay, you stand a chance of attracting new fans. If you give up touring, you\nhave to rely on your existing fanbase and that is bound to decline in time. Back to the DVD,\nwhilst the chaps are talking, the music of YES plays on in the background, occasionally\nbreaking to shots of the live performance.\n\nThe Who frontman and rock legend, Roger Daltrey, provides voice over commentary links\nwhich is a nice touch even though it is often obvious from the tone of his voice that he is\nreading from a script. Perhaps someone like Bob Harris or Alan Freeman (illness permitting)\nwould have made a more authoritative narrator considering the genre.\nYESSPEAK is split between two discs and has a running time of around three hours. Also\nincluded on disc 2 is an audio feature of the live set which has a slide show displaying whilst\nyou listen appropriately designed so that, for example, when Rick is performing his solo\nmedley, pictures of the keyboard wizard appear.\n\nTechnical Aspects\n\nSound and picture quality is state of the art for the main feature with a choice of Dolby 5.1 or\nDTS though the audio of the live set is 5.1 only. On our review set up using a Toshiba SD-\n330 DVD player and Yamaha RX-V630 a/v receiver, DTS really shines and the drop to 5.1 for\nthe audio section is very noticeable. If you have noticed a difference in sound quality\nbetween DTS and 5.1 on your system we would recommend that if you listen to the main\nfeature in DTS, you listen to the audio section another time so that the difference in sound is\nnot so perceptible.\n\n\nPackage Features\n\nThe menu sections are very easy to navigate with options to play the entire feature or select\nindividual chapters. Before selecting ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“playÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ on the DVD, move across to the audio option to\nchoose either Dolby 5.1 (default) or DTS. If you have attended one too many concerts over\nthe years, there is a subtitle function, which, I suppose, is also useful if you are watching late\nat night when the rest of the household are asleep\n\nYES is not getting any younger yet the chaps still perform with the energy befitting a band in\ntheir prime. The return to the classic line-up appears to have revived an excitement within\nthe band together with a desire to return to the musical depth of their early work and produce\nnew music on a par with Close To The Edge. Only time will tell, but with Rick stating that he\nwill be with the band until the end and Jon saying he has a list of things he wants to achieve\nin the next ten years, the future looks promising for YES. Progressive rock has a strong\nunderground following with many new prog bands forming every year, but the genre needs\nbands of the stature of YES to keep flying the flag. YESSPEAK is an essential documentary\nof a band whose following today, after 35 years, is greater than most bands could ever dream\nof and shows that age and looks are irrelevant as far as good music is concerned. LetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hope\nthat YES are able to keep going for many years to come.\n\nJem Jedrzejewski\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/61244913666579745728.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/61244913666579745728.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/23306273641720610342.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/23306273641720610342.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/69588771129528468630.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/69588771129528468630.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/99925887380073341325.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/99925887380073341325.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/26888067497173805766.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/26888067497173805766.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/64832788306190751904.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/64832788306190751904.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/25828157387947648204.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/25828157387947648204.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/94739385789881143944.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/94739385789881143944.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/38470722514577022932.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/38470722514577022932.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/80686921419564949118.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/80686921419564949118.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nTRACKS INCLUDED\n\n01.
