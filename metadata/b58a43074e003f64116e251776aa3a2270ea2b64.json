For 2000 years, Britain has been a Christian country. Or has it? In fact, our ancestors actually kept many other dark, fantastical beliefs alive. It was a world underpinned by outlandish, dangerous and plain weird beliefs. Ideas that today seem unbelievable, but were seen as uncontroversial and hugely influential, with some having shaped our history as much as mainstream religion.........aka Gods and Monsters\n\n\n\n\n3)  The Undead \nFeaturing dramatic reconstructions, the opening programme examines our fascination with and terror of dead bodies. People in the past believed that even in death a body retained some vital force, and that the dead could rise from the grave to cause havoc among the living. Why did they believe this? What powers did they believe the dead had? And what did they do about it? Tony's journey takes him on a fascinating and sometimes humorous tour of some of the darkest recesses of the ancient mind, and brings him face to face with a plague-breathing zombie, a dead body that seems alive three weeks after it died, and the English monarchs who ate the bodies of their subjects.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/7944/superstitionsscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/7944/superstitionsscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/6599/superstitionsscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/6599/superstitionsscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/3210/superstitionsscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/3210/superstitionsscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img525.imageshack.us/img525/6646/superstitionsscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img525.imageshack.us/img525/6646/superstitionsscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/3692/superstitionsscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/3692/superstitionsscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/3636/superstitionsscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/3636/superstitionsscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img214.imageshack.us/img214/5425/superstitionsscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img214.imageshack.us/img214/5425/superstitionsscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/4985/superstitionsscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/4985/superstitionsscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/249/superstitionsscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/249/superstitionsscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 2037\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.800 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 46.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 5\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8913709/Tony-Robinson-on-the-top-five-superstitions-that-gripped-medieval-Britain.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8913709/Tony-Robinson-on-the-top-five-superstitions-that-gripped-medieval-Britain.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b58a43074e003f64116e251776aa3a2270ea2b64","amp;dn":"National+Geographic+Tony+Robinsons+Superstitions+3of5+The+Undead","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b58a43074e003f64116e251776aa3a2270ea2b64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,138,67,7,78,0,63,100,17,110,37,23,118,170,58,34,112,234,43,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
