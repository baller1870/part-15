He lives with his wife and two daughters, dividing his time between St. Louis, Missouri, and Hailey, Idaho.\n\nGrace Chu &amp; John Knox:\n\nThe Risk Agent (#1): After a Chinese national working for an American-owned construction company is kidnapped in Shanghai, Rutherford RiskÃ¢â‚¬â€a hostage rescue firmÃ¢â‚¬â€is called in. But in China, private investigation is illegal, and operating within its borders will be difficult.\n\nFor the job, the company recruits two outsiders: Grace Chu, a refined forensic expert, to follow the moneyÃ¢â‚¬â€and John Knox, a hard charger who is experienced in both combat and the street culture of Shanghai. But following the money leads to more complex and hazardous consequences than either anticipated. Who is behind the kidnapping? What are their true motives? And more important, can Knox and Grace save the hostages before the deadline? \n\nChoke Point (#2): When an award-winning foreign journalist reveals the existence of an Amsterdam-based sweatshop known as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“knot shopÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that employs and enslaves young girls as laborers, private security firm Rutherford Risk is hired by a philanthropist to find it and shut it down. \n\nDavid Ã¢â‚¬Å“SargeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Dulwich, KnoxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s former boss from their government contractor days, knows that Knox's cultural knowledge, combat skills, and sympathy for the abused make him right for the job. Joined by Grace Chu, whose more subtle skills for acquiring sensitive tech information help to balance Knox's improvisational style, he heads to Amsterdam in an attempt to dismantle the child labor operation and rescue the girls. In their way is a crime organization that has permeated the neighborhoods with goodwill turning even the victims' parents against their would-be saviors. With enemies around every corner, Knox and Grace can't tell the good from the bad. \n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre Ready.
