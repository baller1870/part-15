No such problem with this, his second album. The Dylanesque wordplay is there, but with more narrative detail, as on &quot;4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy),&quot; &quot;Kitty's Back,&quot; and &quot;Rosalita,&quot; each of which became instant Springsteen classics and were demanded by his concert crowds for years. But even on this record, the music isn't allowed to take a back seat to the words--the latter two, at least, are full-tilt rock &amp; roll numbers, with abrupt tempo shifts, soaring instrumental parts, and production that's just chaotic enough to make you wonder if the whole thing is going to blow apart and then smile in appreciation when it doesn't. The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle was the first time Springsteen scaled the heights of rock &amp; roll greatness--but it wouldn't be the last.\nThe Wild, The Innocent, &amp; The E-Street Shuffle is The Boss at his finest. While it may not have the same scope and grandeur of the album following it, Springsteen's mega-hit Born To Run, it contains more than ample doses of the lively spirit, youthful enthusiasm, and endearing optimism that made Bruce Springsteen not only a household name, but the epitome of the American experience.\n\n\nOriginal Release Date: September 11, 1973 \n\n\n   1.
