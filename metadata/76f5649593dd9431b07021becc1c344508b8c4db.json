Arguably the first album made by the \ngroup as a cohesive unit since Violator (and bearing some resemblance to that \nrecord in overall title and song names ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ compare &quot;The Sweetest Condition&quot; with \n&quot;The Sweetest Perfection&quot;), Exciter finds the trio again balancing pop \ncatchiness with experimental depths. As with Ultra, an outside producer helps \nfocus the end results in new, intriguing directions ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in this case, said \nproducer is Mark Bell, known for his work with BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rk but also as part of Warp \nRecords' flagship act LFO, which always acknowledged their own debut to Depeche. \nBell's ear for minimal, crisp beats and quick, subtle arrangements and changes \nsuit Martin Gore's songs beautifully. If there are few storming arena-shaking \nnumbers this time out, the exquisite delicacy throughout is addicting, with \nGore's guitar providing slippery and stinging leads to the smoky, romantic flow \nof Exciter. &quot;When the Body Speaks&quot; is a particular winner, his gentle work and a \nbacking string section combining just right. David Gahan's voice, already \naudibly benefiting from lessons on Ultra, is even more supple and passionate \nthan before, ranging from the fuller delivery on the snaky charm of &quot;Shine&quot; to \nthe haunting album-closer, &quot;Goodnight Lovers,&quot; a romantic lullaby with perfect \ncounterpoint backing vocals. Gore's own singing remains equally fine, as does \nhis lyrical obsessions on, well, obsession ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Breathe,&quot; which quotes more Bible \nnames per verse than most preachers, makes for a good example on both fronts. \nWhen the band fully crank it up, the results work there too ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;The Dead of \nNight&quot; makes for a far superior nod to Gore's glam roots and Depeche's own \nindustrial dance descendants than Songs of Faith and Devotion's &quot;Rush&quot; did. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                          SOME WIKIPEDIA INFORMATION\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExciter is Depeche Mode's tenth studio album, which was released on 14 May 2001 \nin the UK and May 15 in the US. It uses more digital music technology compared \nto their other albums. It was produced by Mark Bell of BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rk and LFO fame. It \nalso had several songs which became big hits in clubs, like &quot;I Feel Loved&quot;. The \nalbum also launched the Exciter Tour, which was one of the band's most \nsuccessful tours.\n\nExciter debuted at #9 in the UK Albums Chart and debuted at #8 in the Billboard \n200 with sales of 115,000 copies. It's the only Depeche Mode's album to debut \nhigher in the US than in the UK. As of July 2008, Exciter has sold 449,000 units \nin the United States and was certified gold there. Exciter also went gold in \nCanada, for shipments of 50,000 units. Today, Exciter has sold more than 3.4 \nmillion units worldwide.\n\nOn October 2, 2007 (October 3 in North America) Exciter was re-released in a \ntwo-disc set, along with Ultra, in the fourth and final set of Depeche Mode \nreissues. The first disc was a remastered version of the original, on an SACD/CD \nhybrid (only a CD in the US). The second disc is a DVD which features the album \nin DTS 5.1, Dolby Digital 5.1 and PCM Stereo. The B-sides from Exciter as well \nas the single version of &quot;Freelove&quot; are included. There are also audio versions \nof all the live Exciter tracks played during the One Night in Paris movie.\n\nLike the other reissues, there is a documentary on the making of Exciter titled \n&quot;Depeche Mode 1999ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2001 (Presenting the intimate and delicate side of Depeche \nMode)&quot;. The documentary begins with the talks of Martin Gore's writer's block \nand what they did about it. It also discusses the first three singles, the \nrecording, the cover art and the Exciter tour (including one of the opening \nacts, Fad Gadget). The documentary is around 30 minutes long. The three members \nof the band are interviewed along with Daniel Miller, Christian Eigner, Peter \nGordeno, Anton Corbijn, and Mute label representatives. The documentary ends \nwith a &quot;To Be Continued...&quot;\n\nProducer Mark Bell does not appear, and although they discuss the fact that the \nband declined not to have Corbijn direct Exciter's music videos, they do not \nmention or interview the two who did direct them.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       SOME TRACKS REVIEWED AT ALLMUSIC\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDREAM ON     \tby Dave Thompson\n\nThe half ironic title says it all and, although writer Martin Gore obscures some \nof his meaning, there's little doubt about the main thrust of &quot;Dream On&quot;. His \nsong's protagonist, a fast-living, fast dissolving-into-disaster party person, \nresides in a world of pain, relieved only by the drugs she imbibes. &quot;It sucked \nyou in, it drugged you down,&quot; Dave Gahan sings, and truthfully, he could be \nspeaking of his own experiences, as his ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbeen there, overdone thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ tone seems \nto serenade his own near self-destruction.\n\nGore's lyrical images are striking, his metaphors even more so, as he twists his \nwords and meanings back in and around on themselves. &quot;As your bony fingers close \naround me long and spindly, death becomes me,&quot; is one of his best and most \nthought provoking lines, while the musical base is equally intriguing, as the \nband play the evocative, acoustic guitar against the jittering, scratchy beats. \nThe arrangement pushes at times into blues, but the rhythm puts paid to that, \nwhile the eerie effects further haunt the song's dark atmosphere. &quot;Dream On&quot; \nkicked off the group's &quot;Exciter&quot; album, and was the first spun off the set onto \nsingle, in May 2001, taking the band back into the British Top 10. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       SOME TRACKS REVIEWED AT WIKIPEDIA\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDREAM ON\n\n&quot;Dream On&quot; is Depeche Mode's thirty-sixth UK single, released on April 23, 2001 \nin the UK and April 24 in the U.S. It was the first single from the album \nExciter.\n\n&quot;Dream On&quot; is an electronic based song mixed in with acoustic guitar and rough \nvocals, causing some people to falsely think of it as a country song. The single \nversion starts with the guitar, while the album version has David Gahan saying \n&quot;Can you feel a little love?&quot; before a minimal electro beat opens the song.\n\nThe B-side is the instrumental song &quot;Easy Tiger&quot;. While the Exciter version is a \nshort interlude, the &quot;Full Version&quot; has an extended intro and continues the song \nwith a similar melody underlined by a beat.\n\nThe music video for &quot;Dream On&quot; was directed by Stephane Sednaoui. One of the \nspecial parts of the video is that it was filmed on Route 66, which is also a \nBobby Troup song that the band covered in 1987 for the &quot;Behind the Wheel&quot; \nsingle.\n\nOn June 26, 2001, the band played &quot;Dream On&quot; on The Late Show with David \nLetterman.\n\n\n\nFREELOVE\n\n&quot;Freelove&quot; is Depeche Mode's thirty-eighth UK single, released on November 5, \n2001 in the UK and December 11 in the U.S. It is the third single for the album \nExciter.\n\nDavid Gahan prior to Exciter called it the best song he's ever sung since \n&quot;Condemnation&quot;.\n\nThe single version of &quot;Freelove&quot; is completely remixed from the album version. \nThe mix was done by Flood, who produced the albums Violator and Songs of Faith \nand Devotion. Flood's return is quite surprising, as he previously wanted to \nnever work with the band again after the strenuous experience of recording Songs \nof Faith and Devotion, during which the band was in-fighting with each other.\n\nThe B-side is an instrumental called &quot;Zenstation&quot;.\n\nThere is also a DVD release of &quot;Freelove&quot;, a first for Depeche Mode. It \ncontained video footage of &quot;Freelove&quot; from the Philadelphia concert in 2001, as \nwell as audio of some of the other songs. It also contained four bonus 30-second \nvideos of the band. The videos were directed by Anton Corbijn.\n\nThe main music video for &quot;Freelove&quot; was directed by John Hillcoat. It is not \navailable on a public release.\n\n\n\nI FEEL LOVED\n\n&quot;I Feel Loved&quot; is Depeche Mode's thirty-seventh UK single, released on July 30, \n2001 in the UK and July 31 in the US. It is the second single for the album \nExciter.\n\n&quot;I Feel Loved&quot; was played live during most of the Exciter Tour but was pulled \nhalfway through the Europe leg for unknown reasons. On August 7, 2001, Depeche \nMode performed &quot;I Feel Loved&quot; on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.\n\nThe B-side is a cover of the Stooges' &quot;Dirt&quot;.\n\nThe music video was directed by John Hillcoat.\n\nThere are four versions, one that uses the &quot;Single Version&quot;, but with a cold \nending, rather than the fading out ending. There are remix videos by Dan-O-Rama, \na long version, and a short version. The two remix versions are composed of \nmodified production shots of the original video. The original version wasn't \nreleased on a public video until The Best Of: Volume 1 was released in 2006. The \nother two aren't on a public release. A version using the Danny Tenaglia Radio \nEdit of the song also exists, but was pulled from the official website and the \nlabel's effort to promote it were scrapped.\n\nThe original video features Depeche Mode performing in a club. The setting makes \nfor a hot, sweaty ambience. The club is stormed by policemen with dogs, \napparently trying to close down the gig. The audience, however doesn't seem to \nmind the intrusion and some girls play with the dogs.\n\n\n\n\nGOODNIGHT LOVERS\n\n&quot;Goodnight Lovers&quot; is Depeche Mode's thirty-ninth UK single, released on 11 \nFebruary 2002. It is the fourth and final single for the album Exciter.\n\n&quot;Goodnight Lovers&quot; is a lullaby of sorts, a strange choice for a single that \nsurprised many fans who were expecting &quot;The Dead of Night&quot; or &quot;The Sweetest \nCondition&quot;. It was also surprising as the song was not played live during the \nExciter Tour, making it the first single that wasn't played live at its album's \ntour since &quot;Little 15&quot; (It was later featured in the encore of Touring the \nAngel). The single version is the same as the album closer from Exciter.\n\nThe single did not qualify for the UK Singles Chart because it had excess songs. \nSingles with more than one unique track need no more than three tracks, while \nthis single had four. The B-sides are remixes of &quot;When the Body Speaks&quot;, &quot;The \nDead of Night&quot;, and &quot;Goodnight Lovers&quot;. However, it did qualify for the Budget \nAlbums Chart and went straight to Number One before falling rapidly, the first \nDepeche Mode single to reach Number One in an official UK chart.\n\nThe UK only had a CD release, but there were other European countries that got a \n12&quot; release, their tracklists are all the same. The single was not released in \nthe USA.\n\nThe music video for &quot;Goodnight Lovers&quot; was directed by John Hillcoat, filmed in \nGermany following the final Exciter Tour concert in Mannheim. It is not \navailable on a public release.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               EAC LOG EXTRACT\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4 from 23.

It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and \nexpecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and \nexpressing this is legitimate.\n\nI've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ \npeople, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading \nand therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, \nbut to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused \ntools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for\nfree.\n\nIF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING \nA LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent \nalive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is\nreached.\n\nThanks\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76f5649593dd9431b07021becc1c344508b8c4db","amp;dn":"Depeche+Mode+-+Exciter+%28Remaster+2007%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D+%5BRePoPo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76f5649593dd9431b07021becc1c344508b8c4db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,245,100,149,147,221,148,49,176,112,33,190,204,28,52,69,8,184,196,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
