The nine-year-old at the center of Blame It on Fidel has it much harder: Her parents are communists. Anna&amp;#039;s (Nina Kervel-Bey) bourgeois Parisian life is turned upside down when her aunt, a refugee of Franco-led Spain, shows up and forces a sea change in the family&amp;#039;s political attitude. The father (Stefano Accorsi) leaves a position at a successful law firm to become a diplomat to Chile&amp;#039;s new socialist president, while the mother (Julie Depardieu) ditches writing Marie Clare articles to helm a book about abortion rights. The family uproots Anna from their luxurious home to a cramped apartment. Meanwhile, her Cuban-born nanny packs her bags, though not without giving the child a piece of her mind: &quot;It&amp;#039;s all Fidel&amp;#039;s fault.&quot; So forms Anna&amp;#039;s association between 1970s radicalism and all the miseries of childhood.\n\nBlame It on Fidel&amp;#039;s most charming scene finds Anna playing &quot;shop&quot; with a couple of barbudos, her father&amp;#039;s socialist friends who drop into the apartment late at night to strategize (about what it&amp;#039;s never clear; the film, like Anna, is not interested in the specifics of politics). One of the men splits an orange into equal parts, imagining that it&amp;#039;s the world&amp;#039;s wealth, and gives Anna a slice. Of course, it would taste just as sweet if she had the whole thing. Anna is a loud, stubborn brat who voices her concern at the slightest change in her daily rituals, from a pre-dinner bath to the family&amp;#039;s Sunday breakfasts. In the film&amp;#039;s title, writer-director Julie Gavras recognizes the bluntness of her naÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ve convictions.\n\nGavras uses Anna&amp;#039;s precocious reason to tackle a generation&amp;#039;s idealism head-on. If Anna&amp;#039;s disease is affluence, then her parents are guilty of disingenuousness. The father pulls Anna from her cherished divinity classes, and the mother becomes clearly incensed when a friend won&amp;#039;t take her advice to get an abortion; it looks and sounds like liberalism but stinks of fascism. Anna wonders aloud about their sudden shift in ideology, seeing through to the movement&amp;#039;s activist charade. Blame It on Fidel evokes the gaze of a child seeing the world, for the first time, clearly. During the haunting climax, Anna stands statue-like after a street demonstration has been broken up, lost in a fog of teargas. Kervel-Bey&amp;#039;s face bears the chubby innocence of Shirley Temple, but there&amp;#039;s no underestimating her character&amp;#039;s resolve; her parents brought her into this mess, but she faces it on her own terms.\n\nIs it any coincidence that Anna comes into her own just as her father&amp;#039;s political identity shatters? In a breathtaking silent sequence, a television newscast announces the death of Salvador Allende in a coup d&amp;#039;ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tat. The idealism that once gripped the youth of the &amp;#039;60s is now over, and with the fall of one generation&amp;#039;s ideas comes the arrival of another&amp;#039;s: Anna has for the first time made her own political decision, transferring to a public school in the tradition of her parents&amp;#039; egalitarianism. On her way out the door, Anna grips her father&amp;#039;s handÃƒÂ¢??a familiar sign of compassion, but also a passing of the baton. Gavras&amp;#039;s final shot is a quietly ravishing visual metaphor for Anna&amp;#039;s path to political consciousness: In the schoolyard&amp;#039;s hustle and bustle, she strikes up a friendship with a group of students playing &quot;Ring Around the Rosie.&quot;\n\n&quot;In any given festival there is usually at least one movie that chronicles a time of political trauma from the point of view of a child,&quot; New York Times critic A.O. Scott quipped in a recent article on the Berlin Film Festival. The temptation to call Blame It on Fidel formulaicÃƒÂ¢??with its restrained technique and relaxed rhythmÃƒÂ¢??is easy, but the film&amp;#039;s uncanny observations can&amp;#039;t be easily dismissed. This is not a film about politics strained through a child&amp;#039;s eyes; this is more a film about childhood, strained through the tumult of politics. No doubt influenced by the iconoclasm of her father Costa, Gavras charts Anna&amp;#039;s identity crisis in the shards of a population&amp;#039;s unrest, when the outcry against the Vietnam War in 1968 gave way to human rights movements and the search for a new world order. When Anna makes the mistake of answering a question with the rest of her class, she learns not to be a sheep. Her parents, likewise, learn that they have to let their daughter go. In its own, slight way, Blame It on Fidel is a work of everyday realism on par with The Best of Youth. Like that film, it profoundly connects a family&amp;#039;s heartache to the tears in a country&amp;#039;s social fabric.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a81f89915ffb66adf4eb2e1a811902c154cd03c","amp;dn":"La+Faute+%C3%A0+Fidel+and+extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a81f89915ffb66adf4eb2e1a811902c154cd03c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,129,248,153,21,255,182,106,223,78,178,225,168,17,144,44,21,76,208,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
