This series opens with a death in the harbour; the investigation quickly leads to the discovery of more bodies aboard a ship moored offshore. It looks as if this will be the main plot line of the series but then the young daughter of the shipping company is kidnapped and held for ransom. As the series progresses it becomes clear that the kidnapper has an agenda other than just getting money; he is determined that those he believes were responsible for a cover-up involving the death of another girl must pay. As with the first series this takes place against the background of an election; this time the election will determine who will be the next prime minister. Inevitably the politicians find themselves linked to the case in many ways; the girl's father is a party donor and more than one politician is somehow connected to the case the kidnapper is interested in.\n\nWith only ten episodes this series is only half the length of the original and that is probably a good thing as it meant the story was kept taut while still not feeling rushed. The suspense was even greater than the earlier series as the viewer is constantly wondering about the welfare of the kidnapped girl as well as trying to figure out who is guilty of what. Lead actress Sofie GrÃƒÂ¥bÃƒÂ¸l once again shows star quality as protagonist Sarah Lund; a character who is both believable as a policewoman and as a person in general. The mixture of crime and politics is nicely balanced and you don't have to understand the nuances of Danish politics to understand what is happening. The conclusion isn't the most upbeat imaginable but suited the story and wasn't quite as downbeat as it could have been. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:764a49605c34b141cf94d463c2d4a65672a2411f","amp;dn":"Forbrydelsen+III","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"764a49605c34b141cf94d463c2d4a65672a2411f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,74,73,96,92,52,177,65,207,148,212,99,194,212,166,86,114,162,65,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
