But for godÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sake donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t say it in front of Reverend Peyton. The guitar-wielding leader of The Reverend PeytonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Big Damn Band has no problem praising Johnson and his incredible body of work. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBut thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s only one King of the Delta Blues, and his name was Charley Patton,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Peyton said. \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll go toe-to-toe with anyone who says different.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ This summer Peyton and his band released a powerful tribute to their hero in the form of Peyton on Patton. The 13-track CD exclusively features songs written and recorded by Patton during his brief recording career, which came to an end upon his premature death in 1934.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHis playing style melded the delicate elements of Mississippi John HurtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music, the vocal anguish and slash-and-burn acoustic slide styles of Charley Patton and Son House, the rebelliousness and everyman storytelling of folk icon Woody Guthrie, and a hint of Americana rock of the kind performed by Scarecrow era John Mellencamp, also a Southern Indiana native.
