The simulation results were in accordance with the experiments on the (i) growth sustainability of pore channels guided by pre-patterns; and (ii) substrate grain orientation dependence on self-ordering. In addition, a new fabrication method for the rapid synthesis of highly self-ordered nanoporous alumina is established, based on a systematic search for the self-ordering conditions in experiments. Lastly, it reports on a novel surface-charge induced strain in nanoporous alumina-aluminium foils, which indicates that nanoporous alumina can be used as a new type of actuating material in micro-actuator applications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fac760a44691eadbc38b4331a12cc5ca54151b6","amp;dn":"Electro-Chemo-Mechanics+of+Anodic+Porous+Alumina+Nano-Honeycombs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fac760a44691eadbc38b4331a12cc5ca54151b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,172,118,10,68,105,30,173,188,56,180,51,26,18,204,92,165,65,81,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
