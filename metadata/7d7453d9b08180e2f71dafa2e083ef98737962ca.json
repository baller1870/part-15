This set collects\nfive of her earliest albums, including 1957s Nina Simone and Her Friends, 1959s\nThe Amazing Nina Simone and Nina Simone at Town Hall, 1960s Nina at Newport, and\n1961s Forbidden Fruit, in a single box. Even at the start of her career, Simone\ndidn't just sing a song -- she made it hers.\n\n\nTrack List\n\n\nDISC 1\n\n1 - I Love You Porgy [04:12]\n2 - Love Me or Leave Me [03:22]\n3 - Mood indigo [04:03]\n4 - You'll Never Walk Alone [03:47]\n5 - Little Girl Blue [04:18]\n6 - My Baby Just Cares For Me [03:38]\n7 - Good Bait [05:28]\n8 - Plain Gold Ring [03:50]\n9 - Central park Blues [03:06]\n10 - African Mailman [03:10]\n11 - See Line Woman [03:46]\n12 - When I Was A Young Girl [04:45]\n13 - Please Read me (Live) [03:10]\n14 - For A While (Live) [05:27]\n15 - House Of The Rising Sun (Live) [06:56]\n\n\nDISC 2\n\n1 - To Be Young, Gifted And Black (Live) [05:06]\n2 - The Assignment Song (Live) [04:55]\n3 - I'll Look Aroud (Live) [02:45]\n4 - Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood (Live) [03:52]\n5 - No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed (Live)[04:05]\n6 - Gin House Blues (Live) [04:55]\n7 - After You've Gone (Live) [05:39]\n8 - Ain't No Use (Live) [02:46]\n9 - Blues (Live) [04:42]\n10 - Zungo (Live) [02:34]\n11 - Pirate Jenny (Live) [04:44]\n12 - Don't Smoke In Bed (Live) [03:11]\n13 - To Love Somebody (Live) [03:14]\n14 - You Took My Teeth (Live) [01:08]\n\nDISC 3\n\n1 - The Other Woman (Live) [04:17]\n2 - Mississippi Goddam (Live) [04:44]\n3 - Four Women (Live) [04:50]\n4 - I Want A Little Sugar In My Bowl (Live) [03:25]\n5 - Do what You Gota Do (Live) [03:46]\n6 - Ne me quitte pas (Live) [05:14]\n7 - He Needs Me [02:30]\n8 - He's Got The Whole World In His Hands [03:10]\n9 - Backlash Blues (Live) [02:46]\n10 - For All We Know [04:01]\n11 - Cotton Eyed Joe (Live) [03:46]\n12 - Ain't Got No...
