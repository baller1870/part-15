He always encouraged young talent and, more than practically any bandleader from the swing era, kept his repertoire quite modern. Although Herman was always stuck performing a few of his older hits (he played &quot;Four Brothers&quot; and &quot;Early Autumn&quot; nightly for nearly 40 years), he much preferred to play and create new music.
