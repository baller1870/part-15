Chad Stuart (born in Windemere, England, on December 10, 1941) and Jeremy Clyde (born March 22, 1941, in Buckinghamshire, England) met while attending London's Central School of Speech and Drama. The two became fast friends, and after Stuart taught Clyde to play guitar, they formed a folk duo as well as a rock &amp; roll group, the Jerks. Because he graduated a year ahead of his bandmates, Clyde relocated to Scotland and performed with the Dundee Repertory Theatre. ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:3ifyxqw5ldfe~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:3ifyxqw5ldfe~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review excerpts:\n\nChad &amp; Jeremy's first British LP, Sing for You, was -- confusingly -- an entirely different release than the American LP bearing the same title, which was the second of the duo's U.S. long-players, and featured different tracks for the most part. The U.K. Sing for You was pretty similar to Chad &amp; Jeremy's first American LP (Yesterday's Gone), with the exception of a different running order and a few different tracks. ...\n\nAlthough Chad &amp; Jeremy's Second Album was not released in the U.S., there's not much reason for collectors to sweat out trying to find the LP, as all of its tracks did come out in some form stateside. In fact, Second Album had nearly the same contents as the duo's second American LP (titled Sing for You, and, confusingly, not at all the same as the British LP called Sing for You, which was their first U.K. long-player). ...\n\n... If you do want to hear everything from Second Album in the original order, try to find the reissue compilation Sing for You/Second Album, which combines the first two albums and five additional tracks on a single-CD release.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
