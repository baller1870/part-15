Paneling! Action!\n\nn this episode, the teams take on three common tasks that are mundane but mandatory for every handyman. Challenge One has them insulating a wall, applying a vapour barrier, and then topping it up with paneling. It's not glamorous, but definitely necessary to keep out the elements. Challenge Two has the participants putting up an exterior light fixture. And Challenge Three has them slaving over the kitchen stove (installing cupboards). Warmth, light, and storage Ã¢â‚¬â€ just what every cottage needs.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 11-May-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34f4f9e67570f524a0a86fca790ad9a34d9bb6c6","amp;dn":"Blood.Sweat.and.Tools.S01E05.PDTV.x264-CBM.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34f4f9e67570f524a0a86fca790ad9a34d9bb6c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,244,249,230,117,112,245,36,160,168,111,202,121,10,217,163,77,155,182,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
