The preamplifier was a Cambridge 640P. Sound card, an ASUS XONAR Essence ST (Windows 7).\nRecorded using Audacity 1.3 Beta. Pops, Clicks, and Noise removed using iZotope Rx Advanced 2.01 software.\niZotope was easily the most important part of this processe. Some of my vinyl is fifty years old. All were recorded using 32-bit float at 96 kHz sample rate, then ouputed to 32-bit 96 kHz WAV files, then edited with iZotope. The edited WAV files were then converted to 24-96 FLAC files.\n\n\nFontessa is a 1956 album by the Modern Jazz Quartet released on Atlantic Records No.1231. It was the first of their albums released on Atlantic.\n    \n      Track listing\n\n   1. &quot;Versailles&quot; (John Lewis) - 3:22\n   2. &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; (Earl Brent, Matt Dennis) - 3:48\n   3. &quot;Fontessa&quot; (Lewis) - 11:12\n   4. &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; (Harold Arlen, E.Y.
