The first several months were bumpy, as Webb and company worked out the program's format and eventually became comfortable with their characters (Friday was originally portrayed as more brash and forceful than his later usually relaxed demeanor). Gradually, Friday's deadpan, fast-talking persona emerged, described by John Dunning as &quot;a cop's cop, tough but not hard, conservative but caring.&quot; (Dunning, 210) Friday's first partner was Sergeant Ben Romero, portrayed by Barton Yarborough, a longtime radio actor. Raymond Burr was on board to play Captain Ed Backstrand. When Dragnet hit its stride, it became one of radio's top-rated shows.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d728d369f4740dc3a8a1ec7a858534dd9fbdbc53","amp;dn":"88+DRAGNET+RADIO+SHOWS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d728d369f4740dc3a8a1ec7a858534dd9fbdbc53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,40,211,105,244,116,13,195,168,161,236,122,133,133,52,221,159,189,188,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
