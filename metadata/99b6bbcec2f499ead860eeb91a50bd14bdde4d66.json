Peter Cushing is always great, and the other actors are equally good. You have to sit through a lot of talk - hey, it's an investigation - but they do make it interesting. Loosely inspired by the de Havilland Comet fiasco.\n\nThe presentation varies between widescreen and pan-and-scan, sorry, it isn't my fault.\n\nAlso known as Trouble in the Sky.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99b6bbcec2f499ead860eeb91a50bd14bdde4d66","amp;dn":"Cone+of+Silence+%281960%29+Peter+Cushing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99b6bbcec2f499ead860eeb91a50bd14bdde4d66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,182,187,206,194,244,153,234,216,96,238,185,26,80,189,20,189,222,77,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
