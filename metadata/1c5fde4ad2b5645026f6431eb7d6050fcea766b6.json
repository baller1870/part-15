EMUÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like the 4VEP were a part of daily life to hundreds of thousands of commuters, with the persistent slamming of their doors signalling the imminent departure of another busy service. Each 4-car set was powered by 750-volt DC electricity supplied via a third rail, giving a top speed of 90mph. Built by BREL at York, these classic EMUs served for almost 40 years, their high-density seating layouts and performance proving adequate for their role until the introduction of the more modern Ã¢â‚¬ËœDersiroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ units.
