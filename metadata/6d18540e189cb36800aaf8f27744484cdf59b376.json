It was their first album of new studio material since 1987's All, after which singer Milo Aukerman had left the band to pursue a career in biochemistry. The remaining members (bassist Karl Alvarez, guitarist Stephen Egerton, and drummer Bill Stevenson) had changed the band's name to All and released eight albums between 1988 and 1995 with singers Dave Smalley, Scott Reynolds, and Chad Price. When Aukerman decided to return to music the group chose to operate as two acts simultaneously, playing with Aukerman as the Descendents and with Price as All. Everything Sucks was the first Descendents release to chart, reaching #132 on the Billboard  200 and #4 on Top Heatseekers, supported by the singles &quot;I'm the One&quot; and &quot;When I Get Old&quot;.\n\nFormat: CD\nReleased: 1996\nLabel: Epitaph Records\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Punk\nQuality: FLAC\n\nTracks:\n\n 1.
