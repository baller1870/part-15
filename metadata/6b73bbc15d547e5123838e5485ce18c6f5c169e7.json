Rust on March 6, 2013\nHollywood Utopia argues that Hollywood films since at least the 1950s have been an important site for viewers to engage with environmental issues. Brereton calls our attention not only to films with obvious environmental themes like Soylent Green and Logan's Run but also to films where ecology bubbles up from beneath the surface, as in Titanic. The book is expansive and thought provoking and a lynchpin in the growing field of ecocinema studies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b73bbc15d547e5123838e5485ce18c6f5c169e7","amp;dn":"Hollywood+Utopia+Ecology+in+Contemporary+American+Cinema%28pdf%29%7BZz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b73bbc15d547e5123838e5485ce18c6f5c169e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,115,187,193,93,84,126,81,35,131,142,84,133,206,24,198,245,193,105,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
