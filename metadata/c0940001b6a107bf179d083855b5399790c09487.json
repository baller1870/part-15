The early tracks show the group evolving from its doo-wop roots into soul's premier group.\nWhile the cuts on this disc aren't the ones that made The Temptations popular music institutions, they're still a vital part of their legacy. (AMG)\n\n\n\n\nFor those like me who have dozens of copies already of &quot;My Girl,&quot; &quot;Cloud Nine,&quot; &quot;Just My Imagination,&quot; and so forth, &quot;More of the Best,&quot; is a splendid excursion into some of their better b-sides and album cuts. (SOME minor A-sides appear here: &quot;Heavenly,&quot; &quot;Take A Look Around,&quot; &quot;Plastic Man,&quot; &quot;I Want A Love I Can See.&quot; )\n\nThe majestic Smokey Robinson love song, &quot;What Love Has Joined Together&quot; (originally B-side to &quot;It's Growing&quot; and also recorded by Mary Wells) and the cocky &quot;You've Got To Earn It&quot; - &quot;If you deserve it you can get it, I'll be glad to see you with it,&quot; (Originally B-side to &quot;Since I Lost My Baby&quot; ), all by themselves seal the worth of this one. In a broader sense, &quot;Earn&quot; is a wonderful ode to self-respect, and Eddie Kendricks sings the lead as a man who will NOT have the love he offers taken for granted. Lyrically, it's loaded to the gills with some of Smokey Robinson's best rhymes and metaphors.\n\nIt's an album for those who do NOT have the &quot;Emperors of Soul&quot; 5-disc set, but would like to augment the more standard 'greatest hits' sets.
