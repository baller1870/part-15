The first track on each cd, Psalm 103, is the same on all four cds.  Other tracks, like &quot;Lord I have cried&quot; are lyrically the same, but are sung in different modes.  Otherwise, the stychera, doxastica, appostycha, and appolitychia are different for each tone.  A must have for any lover of chant.  Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c29347da020369329cc8226e6cfb096ff8c384f0","amp;dn":"Vassilis+Hadjinicolaou+-+Vespers+%28all+8+modes%29+Byzantine+Music+i","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c29347da020369329cc8226e6cfb096ff8c384f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,147,71,218,2,3,105,50,156,200,34,110,108,251,9,111,248,195,132,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
