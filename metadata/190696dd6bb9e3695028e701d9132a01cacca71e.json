Priceless\n2. Immune\n3. Raising Innocence\nFormat: Epub &amp; Mobi\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“My name is Rylee and I am a Tracker.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nPriceless:\nWhen children go missing, and the Humans have no leads, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m the one they call. I am their last hope in bringing home the lost ones. I salvage what they cannot.\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m on the FBIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wanted list. \nI have a werewolf for a pet, a Witch of a best friend, and have no need for anyone else in my life. \nBut when a salvage starts to spin out of control, help comes from a most unexpected direction. One that is dangerously dark, brooding, and doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know a thing about the supernatural. \nOne whose kisses set me on fire.\nImmune: \nWhen children go missing, and the Humans have no leads, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m the one they call. I am their last hope in bringing home the lost ones. I salvage what they cannot.\nUnderestimating demons is a bad idea, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a mistake that may cost me not only my own life, but the life of a missing child.\nIf I can swallow my pride, and allow Agent OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Shea to help me find a way to deal with the demon, we might be able to save the child.\nWith this salvage, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a race against time, a test of trust, and a temptation that I'm doing my damnedest to ignore.\nIf only swallowing my pride was that easy.\nRaising Innocence:\nThe FBI wants me on their team. Bad enough that they are dangling bait they KNOW I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t resist. \nThe catch? ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on the other side of the ocean.\nAnd if I want what theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re offering, I have to help them with a salvage gone terribly, terribly wrong. \nBut this time, I have no back up. I have no Plan B. \nAnd I have no OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Shea","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:190696dd6bb9e3695028e701d9132a01cacca71e","amp;dn":"Shannon+Myer-+Rylee+Adamson+Series+1-3+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"190696dd6bb9e3695028e701d9132a01cacca71e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,6,150,221,107,185,227,105,80,40,231,1,217,19,42,1,202,204,167,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
