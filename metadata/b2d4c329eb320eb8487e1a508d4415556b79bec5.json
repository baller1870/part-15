Adapted for the the screen by John Michael Hayes, the film follows the events that befall Luke Miller (Michael Connors) when he discovers that his daughter, Danielle (Joey Heatherton), has been arrested for murdering his ex-wife Valerie's (Susan Hayward) new lover. As Danielle's trial unfurls, and the sordid events of the family's past are brought into the open, Luke is forced to address and relive several of the painful events that led to the family's present state. Also starring Bette Davis as Valerie's mother and a pre-Star Trek DeForest Kelley, Where Love Has Gone netted Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn, the songwriters behind the film's title song. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058745/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058745/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:56:54\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 560x432 1.30:1\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 29,97\nBitRate : 1548 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,22 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2d4c329eb320eb8487e1a508d4415556b79bec5","amp;dn":"Where+Love+Has+Gone+%281964%29+Bette+Davis+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2d4c329eb320eb8487e1a508d4415556b79bec5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,212,195,41,235,50,14,184,72,126,26,80,141,68,21,85,107,121,190,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
