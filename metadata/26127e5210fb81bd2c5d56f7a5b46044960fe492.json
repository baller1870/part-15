The culmination of his years at this particular intellectual pursuit, Ancient Egypt: The Light of the World is Massey's crown jewel. In this, the most philosophical (in both tone and concept) of his Egyptological works, Massey, ever the intrepid escort, leads a tour through thousands of years of sociological, cultural, and spiritual development, all the while pointing, with dazzling reason and persuasive prose, to a distant, common, Egyptian origin. British author GERALD MASSEY (1828-1907) published works of poetry, spiritualism, Shakespearean criticism, and theology, but his best-known works are in the realm of Egyptology, including A Book of the Beginnings and The Natural Genesis.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26127e5210fb81bd2c5d56f7a5b46044960fe492","amp;dn":"Ancient+Egypt+The+Light+of+the+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26127e5210fb81bd2c5d56f7a5b46044960fe492","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,18,126,82,16,251,129,189,44,93,86,247,165,180,96,68,150,15,228,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
