Recent shows have taken their high-octane, crowd-pleasing antics across the country, steadily garnering them a large and loyal following along the way.\n\nThey recently supported Maverick Sabre on his debut nationwide tour after a releasing a series of covers on SB.TV.\n\nDriven by a shared love of music that pushes the envelope, KINGS OF THE CITY are regularly recording new material and releasing videos.\n\nLook out for their next double EP 'No Guts No Glory' in Summer 2012...\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœWhat music in the 21st century should sound likeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nJon McClure (Reverend And The Makers)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœA refreshing mix of raw bars, guitars, and hearts of kings!

I am expecting great things for them in the futureÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ - Lowkey\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœA refreshing new sound for British rap. Pure dopeness!Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nCharlie Sloth (BBC 1Xtra + Radio 1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74434b86cc30f608d346ad086b33366cc0ff4503","amp;dn":"KINGS+OF+THE+CITY+-+No+Rules+To+The+Game+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74434b86cc30f608d346ad086b33366cc0ff4503","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,67,75,134,204,48,246,8,211,70,173,8,107,51,54,108,192,255,69,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
