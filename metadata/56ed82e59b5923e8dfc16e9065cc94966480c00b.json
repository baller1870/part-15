AVRO's TopPop The Golden Years was a Dutch television program that, between 2008 and 2009, was broadcast via Netherlands 3 NPS. TopPop Golden Years brings back unique archival material from legendary TopPop broadcasts. \n\nThe series consisted of thirty minute episodes with clips from the original TopPop television program from the 70s and 80s. The broadcasts were built around themes from disco to funk, from glasses and mustaches to eroticism and from reggae to rock.\n\nThe original TopPop presenter Ad Visser has a very brief cameo beside the clip window. The clips have a few temporary trivia text bars at the bottom of the screen in dutch. There is also a small white &quot;n p s&quot; text to the top left, and a small green box to the top right, both outside of the clip window. \n\n&quot;Hanging on the Telephone&quot; is a song written by Jack Lee and first performed by Lee's short-lived US West Coast power pop trio The Nerves, who placed it as the lead-off track on their 1976 EP, the band's only release. \n\nNew Wave band Blondie popularised the song when it was released as the second single off Parallel Lines in both the U.S. and the UK, eventually reaching number 5 in the UK in November 1978 as well as inspiring other cover versions. \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_on_the_Telephone&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_on_the_Telephone&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 6790kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 256kbps\n   Media Length: 00:02:16\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
