In this year Conrad joined Enzyme Records, started building his own      \n   studio and started his studying Music Technology at the Utrecht School of Arts.\n   He decided to drop the Trypticon-project and concentrate on producing as        \n   Ophidian, focussing on slower hardcore, with more techno and electronic music  \n   influences.\n   Enzyme started a sub-label called Enzyme X on which more experimental hardcore  \n   could be released, which came as a blessing because it provided exactly the \n   space that Conrad needed to define himself and his style.\n   From this moment on progression was fast, and he released quite a number of   \n   tracks including his first solo-album, Ophidian - Blackbox, in 2003.\n   Now Conrad has finished his study and as Bachelor of Music Composition and \n   Production he faces a future in the music bussiness, as a producer mixing and \n   mastering, as DJ and live performer, but still mainly as artist exploring the \n   more experimental areas of hardcore, techno and electronic music.\n   As of the summer of 2005, Ophidian runs his own label called Meta4.\n\n\n\n          2001 - Rhythmic Philosophy (Vinyl) ENZYME 03\n          2002 - Punishment Beyond Death Psychiatric Ass (Vinyl) ENZYME K7 02\n          2003 - Blackbox (CD Album) ENZYME CDE 2004\n          2004 - A Place Called Yesterday (Vinyl) ENZYME 18 X\n          2004 - Butterfly VIP (Vinyl) EXV02\n          2005 - A Gathering Of Styles (3xVinyl) ENZYME 10\n          2005 - A Gathering Of Styles Part 2 (3xVinyl) ENZYME 20\n          2005 - Betrayed By Daylight (2CD Album) ENZYME CDE 2007\n          2005 - La Chronique Du Chat Et Du Chien (Vinyl) META4 D\n          2005 - Phataa Diin God E.P.
