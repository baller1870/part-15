Otherwise PS3 or PC Users will not be able to experience 5.1 audio as you cannot bitstream AAC5.1 for 99% of the products.\n\nPC Users with 5.1/7.1 Surround:\n\nDepending on your configuration, VLC should automatically enable 5.1 playback, but double check by selecting AUDIO ~ Audio Device ~ 5.1\n\nIf 5.1 isn't selected by default, and you do have 5.1 system, ensure your windows sound configuration is setup correctly by navigating to your windows control panel ~ Sound and then selecting the primary audio device followed by clicking the CONFIGURE button below, follow the steps to ensure 5.1 mode is fully enabled.\n\nIn order for the 7.1 Track to be played back, you must use a media player or device that allows you to change tracks, this is something easily done on most Smart tvs, and can be done using VLC as well or similar player, Simply go to AUDIO ~ Audio Track ~ Track 2, then repeat the steps above to ensure that it is detecting/working properly.\n\nIt is HIGHLY recommended that you play the 7.1 track even on 6.1 or 5.1 and stereo units as the audio quality will be the best.\n\nPC Users with 2.0/2.1 Stereo:\n\nDepending on your configuration, VLC should automatically enable 2.0 playback, but double check by selecting AUDIO ~ Audio Device ~ 2.0\n\nIf 5.1 is selected by default, and you do not have 5.1 system, ensure your windows sound configuration is setup correctly by navigating to your windows control panel ~ Sound and then selecting the primary audio device followed by clicking the CONFIGURE button below, follow the steps to ensure 2.0 mode is fully enabled only.\n\nIn order for the 7.1 Track to be played back, you must use a media player or device that allows you to change tracks, this is something easily done on most Smart tvs, and can be done using VLC as well or similar player, Simply go to AUDIO ~ Audio Track ~ Track 2, then repeat the steps above to ensure that it is detecting/working properly.\n\nIt is HIGHLY recommended that you play the 7.1 track even on 6.1 or 5.1 and stereo units as the audio quality will be the best.\n\n\nScreenshot Previews:\n                  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img707/5215/v89s.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img707/5215/v89s.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img202/5619/3v3e.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img202/5619/3v3e.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img845/2592/lj90.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img845/2592/lj90.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img202/3540/j931.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img202/3540/j931.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img20/746/2cn1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img20/746/2cn1.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img823/801/7zcc.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img823/801/7zcc.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img203/5672/vijd.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img203/5672/vijd.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img822/5615/448x.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img822/5615/448x.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img713/4433/8jzy.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img713/4433/8jzy.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img46/958/3lq9.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img46/958/3lq9.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPlease, be patient with seeding...\n\nEnjoy ;)\n\nFeel free to leave a + vote and a comment, Thank You!\n\n\nJudas's Note:\n\n\nA true BdRip, the first one for proper respect of recreating the original with pristine video and audio, video and audio at very high bitrates. Like all my previous encodes, just so much better if you are one that MUST have something fantastic looking and sounding.\n\nThe Audio is encoded that should totally surpass the AC3 640kbps core commonly found/supplied with this size of rip. However like any AAC, older equipment CANNOT bitstream AAC, which requires a complaint device that can decode and then transmit as a compliant bitstream or as raw LPCM, HDMI is your best option. The reason I use AAC is because it's a better/newer/more efficient and overall higher quality format compared to AC3, not to mention it still produces a smaller file size in the end too.\n\nA 5.1 Primary Audio track is provided for Capability purposes in the event that the audio equipment you have or configuration you have either doesn't work with 7.1 AAC OR in the even that selecting 7.1 AAC that the audio channel mapping isn't idea for your specific system.\n\n\nJudas's Note 2:\n\nFor a smaller, Friendlier version of this movie in around the 2-3gb range, it is located here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8080416/The_Avengers_(2012)_1080p_5.1_BrRip_x264_-_Judas&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8080416/The_Avengers_(2012)_1080p_5.1_BrRip_x264_-_Judas&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8edddb75f91891a7fda09a77f1c9f18385931587","amp;dn":"The+Avengers+%282012%29+1080p+7.1+BDRip+x264+HQ+-+Judas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8edddb75f91891a7fda09a77f1c9f18385931587","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,221,219,117,249,24,145,167,253,160,154,119,241,201,241,131,133,147,21,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
