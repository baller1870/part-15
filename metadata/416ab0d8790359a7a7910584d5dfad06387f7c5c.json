Because I need softreset for music apps and i plays nds sometimes or listen music so this is solution was usefull.\nHope it'll be usefull too for someone. My previous uploads with Bowsers and YSmenu is pretty usefull for these days.\n\n\n_R4____________How_it_works_and_what_for_is_______________\n\nBased on 1.18 firmware.\nR4 menu start automaticly. Standard R4 menu with 3 buttons:\n1'st is file browser. \n2'nd Moonshell 2.10 loadder. \n3'rd is gba loader.\nSoft reset works perfect.\n\n\n_YSmenu___________________________________________________\n\nFrom file browser you can run YSmenu v2 updated.\nIt's better for running games and homebrews.\nSoft reset is off by default. Wont work with YSmenu.\nWhen U press START you'll see not 3 but 5 buttons.\nIn the lower line is 2 buttons:\n-back to R4 firmwate witch restart console\n-Moonshell 2.10 loader.\n\n\n_Moonshell_2_10___________________________________________\n\nWhen you decide to play some games just press START and \nchoose EXIT TO FIRMWARE.\nThere's no matter if you are in R4 menu or YSmenu. \nExiting Moonshell couse back to R4 menu\n\n\n\n|                                                          |\n|  I've noticed that after softreset (ABXYLR) when you     |\n|    run YSmenu and some games or Moonshell sometimes DS   |\n|   freez so it's better to stay R4 or do DS hard restart. |\n|        Mix was premade for and tested on R4 colone.      |\n|                                                          |\n|  PS I used 7z archiver so exe file is selfextracting.    |\n|    Run exe for decompress files.
