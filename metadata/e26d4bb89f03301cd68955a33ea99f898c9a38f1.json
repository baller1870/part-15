The 1968ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“76 line-ups are commonly labeled Mark I, II, III and IV.[11][12] Their second and most commercially successful line-up featured Ian Gillan (vocals), Ritchie Blackmore (guitar), Jon Lord (keyboards), Roger Glover (bass) and Ian Paice (drums).[5] This line-up was active from 1969 to 1973 and was revived from 1984 to 1989 and again in 1993, before the rift between Blackmore and other members became unbridgeable. The current line-up including guitarist Steve Morse has been much more stable, though Lord's retirement in 2002 has left Paice as the only original member.\n\n\n\n\nDeepest Purple ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Very Best of Deep Purple 1980\n\n\n\nDeepest Purple: The Very Best of Deep Purple is a compilation album by the British hard rock band Deep Purple, released in 1980.
