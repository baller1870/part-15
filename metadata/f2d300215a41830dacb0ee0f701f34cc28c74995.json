But what drove her to leave the FaeLands and everything she knew behind, for life among humans? Delve into the past of faerie princess Irulan Nightingale, with this short prequel to Ronnie MasseyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut novel, Crimson Dawn.\n\nBorn into a life of duty and responsibility, Irulan would trade it all in a instant. For the princess, royalty isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t an honor, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a burden thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s keeping her away from the one thing she holds closest to her heartÃ¢â‚¬Â¦her soul-mate.\n\nHers is a love that must remain hidden, because although the mighty Tuatha De Danaan are the highest the Light Court has to offer; even they have their prejudices, and mixing with the Dark CourtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s is forbidden. Irulan knows her relationship with Carrie, a refugee from the Dark Court, Fomori, is dangerous for them both. But in all the LandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, Carrie is the one person that she can trust with anything and Irulan refuses to let her go.\n\nFind out what happens when IrulanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s carefully guarded relationship is revealed in, Never Again: An Irulan Short.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2d300215a41830dacb0ee0f701f34cc28c74995","amp;dn":"FF+Ronnie+Massey+-+Never+Again+An+Irulan+Short+%28Darklife+Saga+Sh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2d300215a41830dacb0ee0f701f34cc28c74995","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,211,0,33,90,65,131,13,172,176,238,15,112,31,52,204,40,199,73,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
