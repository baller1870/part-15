The obvious\nprecedent of this group given the instrumentation would be the classic quartets\nled by Ornette Coleman in the late 50's and early 60's. But while those bands\nimprovised freely from Coleman's own quirky compositional ideas, this band\ntakes things a step even further by collectively improvising without a net and\nmolding the fear and exhilaration of such an endeavor into the music. &quot;The\nFreedom Principle&quot; lays things on the line as the group moves valiantly through\nsections of loud and exciting free jazz as a full unit and also sections for\nsoloists supported by the fellow members and and sections of whisper quiet\nmusic where the listener must pay rapt attention to what is happening,\nconsidering that the music is being played at a low volume and a slow pace.\nThe two remaining pieces, &quot;Shadows&quot; and &quot;Pepper Packed&quot; continue this sense\nof dynamism further with Evans sounding much different than he does on discs\nby Mostly Other People Do the Killing where he plays in more of a\npost-bop/free jazz sensibility, and in this case he takes quite a few risks\nin his trumpet playing and Amado follows suit moving from gutsy squalls of\ntenor saxophone to long lines of of ominous wind. The rhythm section is\ninteresting also as Mira's cello gives him a lighter and sharper sound than\na traditional bass and Ferrandini's drums add a depth of texture that makes\nfor a successful recording.\n\n--\n\nBy Stefan Wood &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2014/06/rodrigo-amado-motion-trio-peter-evans.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2014/06/rodrigo-amado-motion-trio-peter-evans.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Mark Corroto &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/the-freedom-principle-rodrigo-amados-motion-trio--peter-evans-nobusiness-records-review-by-mark-corroto.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/the-freedom-principle-rodrigo-amados-motion-trio--peter-evans-nobusiness-records-review-by-mark-corroto.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Grego Applegate Edwards\n\nPar Luc Bouquet (fr)\n\nPor Pachi Tapiz (es) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tomajazz.com/web/?p=13228&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tomajazz.com/web/?p=13228&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:641014a13495081d472f60ccab3b811cc6810bed","amp;dn":"Rodrigo+Amado+%26amp%3B+Peter+Evans+-+The+Freedom+Principle+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"641014a13495081d472f60ccab3b811cc6810bed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,16,20,161,52,149,8,29,71,47,96,204,171,59,129,28,198,129,11,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
