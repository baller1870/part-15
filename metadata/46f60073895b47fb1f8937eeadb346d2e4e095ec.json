Collins's approach to the blues guitar is distinctive, and he alternates between high, singing leads and echoey, low-end motifs, manipulating space and drawing his phrases out with unusual rhythmic variation. His tone, too, is unique; it is heavy, dark, and somewhat cool (which gave rise to his &quot;Iceman&quot; moniker).\n\nCollins surrounds himself with an outstanding backing band of drums, bass, keys, and horns (here featuring three saxophones,a trumpet, and a trombone). The ensemble (the horns, in particular) fills out the funky bounce of &quot;I Got a Problem&quot; andthe insistent boogie of &quot;Don't Go Reaching Across My Plate&quot;. Collins stretches out on every track, peeling off brilliant leads left and right. On &quot;Snowed In&quot;, a down-tempo blues about being caught in a winter storm, Collins uses his guitar to replicate starting up a car's stalled engine. Here, as always, there seems to be little Collins can't manage on six strings. \n\n\n01. If You Love Me Like You Say\n02. Blue Monday Hangover\n03. I Got A Problem\n04.
