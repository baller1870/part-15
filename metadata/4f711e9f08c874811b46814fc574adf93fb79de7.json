For her and her brother, Nik, now in their forties, no relationship is more significant. They grew up in Los Angeles in the late seventies and early eighties. Nik was always the artist, always wrote music, always had a band. Now he makes his art in private, obsessively documenting the work, but never testing it in the world. Denise remains NikÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most passionate and acute audience, sometimes his only audience. She is also her familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first defense against the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fragility. Friends die, their motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s memory and mind unravel, and the news of global catastrophe and individual tragedy haunts Denise. When her daughter, Ada, decides to make a film about Nik, everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vulnerabilities seem to escalate.\n\nDana Spiotta has established herself as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“singularly powerful and provocative writerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (The Boston Globe) whose work is fiercely original. Stone ArabiaÃ¢â‚¬â€riveting, unnerving, and strangely beautifulÃ¢â‚¬â€reexamines what it means to be an artist and redefines the ties that bind","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f711e9f08c874811b46814fc574adf93fb79de7","amp;dn":"Stone+Arabia+by+Dana+Spiotta+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f711e9f08c874811b46814fc574adf93fb79de7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,113,30,159,8,200,116,129,27,70,129,79,197,116,173,249,63,183,157,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
