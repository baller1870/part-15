With this handbook, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to design or develop a site that conforms to Section 508 of the US Rehabilitation ActÃ¢â‚¬â€and in the process youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll discover how to provide a better user experience for everyone.\n\nThe Accessibility Handbook introduces you to several audiences that have difficulty using todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s complex websites, including people with blindness, hearing loss, physical disabilities, and cognitive disorders. Learn how to support assistive technologies, and understand which fonts, colors, page layouts, and other design elements work bestÃ¢â‚¬â€without having to exclude advanced functions, hire outside help, or significantly increase overhead.\n\nDevelop solutions that accommodate:\n\n    * Complete blindness. Create a logical document flow to support screen readers\n    * Low vision and color blindness. Optimize images and color schemes, and ensure your site enlarges gracefully\n    * Hearing impairment. Provide video captions and visual alerts for interactive features\n    * Physical disabilities. Make forms, popups, and navigation easier to use\n    * Cognitive disorders.
