In this movie Frank comes out of retirement to investigate the murder of an ex-girlfriend's husband.\n\n\nIMDB: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081417/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081417/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCannon debuted in 1971 and the series ran from 1971-1976. This series was great and Cannon had to be the first guy with a car phone. He always drove a big Lincoln and wasn't afraid to get physical if he had to. He had one mean karate chop :) In this movie he is driving a Cadillac Coupe DeVille.\n\nDownload and enjoy, and please seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d0b2ed1be87c001f1c7460022094df2e2a31064","amp;dn":"The+Return+of+Frank+Cannon+%281980%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d0b2ed1be87c001f1c7460022094df2e2a31064","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,11,46,209,190,135,192,1,241,199,70,0,34,9,77,242,226,163,16,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
