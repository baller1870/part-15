The airport was remodeled and reinaugurated in December 2001, in order to serve the islands of the Central Group (Terceira, Graciosa, SÃƒÂ£o Jorge, Pico and Faial), as well as expanded to support domestic connectivity to Lisbon.\nIt is an important economic tool in the economy of the region, and vital connection to the smaller aerodromes in the outlying islands. Currently, there are plans to expand the runways by 275 m (902 ft), and night time air flight services have been approved.\nThe airport at Horta was inaugurated on August 24, 1971 by then President Almirante AmÃƒÂ©rico TomÃƒÂ¡s. On July 5, 1985 TAP Air Portugal initiated direct flights between Horta and Lisbon: the first aircraft was a Boeing 737 named Ponta Delgada.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ec50bbbb3f766f75e026153e215441dc6a1bbbd","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%2FP3D%5D+TropicalSim+-+Horta+LPHR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ec50bbbb3f766f75e026153e215441dc6a1bbbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,197,11,187,179,247,102,247,94,2,97,83,226,21,68,29,198,161,187,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
