Naturally we would like to hear your feedback on this new feature as you use it.\n\nAnd of course, since the Windows Feedback app is a Universal Windows Platform app, it means the next mobile flight will include the ability to share feedback as well.\nHere is a sneak peek of what that will look like:\n\nMobile-Share-Feedback-2\n\nI know many of you are eagerly awaiting a new mobile build. We have found and fixed a few issues that would be a blocker for some \nInsiders in recent builds in our internal rings, so we havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t had one we felt was ready to go out to you since 10512.\nWe have some good candidates coming through with those fixes, so after we run them for a while and ensure they are ready for you weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get them out.\nStay tuned to the Windows Blog or follow me on Twitter for an announcement when we have one.\n\nAlso with this build, language packs are available for our supported languages in the Windows Insider program.\n\nKeep an eye out on the Insider Hub\n\nWe have some upcoming feature announcements for both PC and mobile that Insiders will get to try out first. Stay tuned for more details soon.\n\nKnown Issues\n\nWindows Hello face sign-on will not work on this build with some devices; the device can still be unlocked with other methods like pin, password, or fingerprint.\nAs reported by Insiders on the build 10525, 64 bit Google Chrome will crash on launch. Google is aware of the issue.\nIn the meantime their 64 bit Google Chrome Canary build or 32 bit Google Chrome will work on this build.\nI hope you enjoy the new build, and please keep sending us feedback on your experience via the Windows Feedback app","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31f0b7b28f588283b27d3959914fc5272fe0c668","amp;dn":"Windows+10+Pro+10532+%28x64-dvd-en%29+%7E+GY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31f0b7b28f588283b27d3959914fc5272fe0c668","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,240,183,178,143,88,130,131,178,125,57,89,145,79,197,39,47,224,198,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
