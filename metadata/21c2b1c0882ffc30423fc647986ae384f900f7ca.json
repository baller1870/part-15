But if you play serious correspondence chess you will probably want to take a look. It's interesting and may be useful for research. It might also be a basis for building your own correspondence chess database using this one for starters. I notice that it also contains some Fischer Random Chess (960) games which may not be of interest.\n\nInstructions:\n-unpack the .7z file which gives an .exe file\n-run the .exe file which installs the database\n-open the .cbh file with Chessbase or your favorite CB GUI (Fritz, Hiarcs, Junior, Shredder, etc)\n\n-----------------\nPLEASE HELP SEED!\n-----------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21c2b1c0882ffc30423fc647986ae384f900f7ca","amp;dn":"Correspondence+Chess+Database+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21c2b1c0882ffc30423fc647986ae384f900f7ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,194,177,192,136,47,252,48,66,63,198,71,152,106,227,132,249,0,247,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
