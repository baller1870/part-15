Yuji Kajiura is both the composer and producer of the entire ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNOIRÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ soundtrack collection from the hit anime originating in Japan. If you recognize her name, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s of no surprise because Yuki Kajiura also composed and produced the soundtracks to several other animes, such as Madlax, .hack//SIGN, Aquarian Age, My-HiMe, My-Otome, Tsubasa Chronicle, and one of the Kimagure Orange Road movies (amongst others). She also assisted Toshihiko Sahashi with Mobile Suit Gundam SEED and Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny. Kajiura has also composed for the Xenosaga video game series, namely the cutscene music for Xenosaga II and the entire Xenosaga III soundtrack. Yuki Kajiura was born in Japan on August 6, 1965 in Tokyo, Japan and she still resides in Tokyo to this day.\n\nWell I hope you like it because I certainly do.
