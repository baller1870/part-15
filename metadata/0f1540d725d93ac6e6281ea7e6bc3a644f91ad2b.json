This Definite Collection shows what a diverse duo\nthey really were and how many memorable tunes they performed together.\nThough many were put off by the pair's more sterile folk-rock arrangements\nand clean choirboy harmonies, this collection shows that there was much more\nto their artistic palette. Songs such as &quot;Homeward Bound&quot;, &quot;I Am a Rock&quot;,\n&quot;Cecilia&quot; and &quot;Mrs Robinson&quot; all show that the duo could rock with the best of\nthem and &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; and &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; are just\nsome of the beautifully timeless records the pair gave us. It may not be as\ndefinitive as it claims but this is a great collection featuring some of their best\nand most well known works. --Paul Sullivan\n\n\nThe Definitive Simon and Garfunkel (1991) - Released in Europe by Sony Music \nEntertainment (UK) and available in the U.S. as an import. \n(Note: the track lists of this and 20 Greatest Hits differ from each other \n- they are not the same album.)\n\n\n  01.
