Unfortunately, through no fault of their own, none of their guests leave their rooms alive. In order to protect their business, the family resorts to burying the corpses in the backyard, but this only leads to a zombie problem. Meanwhile, the daughter falls in love with Richard, a mysterious British navy officer, who looks suspiciously Japanese but claims to be the nephew of Queen Elizabeth herself. Just when Richard bungles onto a clue that might lead him to uncover the string of disappearing guests, a nearby volcano begins rumbling to life. Propelled by musical numbers rife with movie and pop culture references, The Happiness of the Katakuris is a departure from Miike's famously gruesome thrillers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Kenji Sawada, Keiko Matsuzaka, Shinji Takeda\r\nDIRECTOR......: Takashi Miike\r\nWRITERS.......: Ai Kennedy, Kikumi Yamagishi\r\nGENRE.........: Comedy | Fantasy | Musical\r\nRATING........: 7.2/10  6,536 votes\r\nMETASCORE.....: 60\r\nIMDB Link.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0304262\r\nRUNTIME.......: 1h 52mn\r\nSIZE..........: 3.00GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264 (  )\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x1080\r\nASPECT RATIO..: 1.78:1\r\nBITRATE.......: 3500 Kbps (3 pass)\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO.........: Japanese AC3+ 2.0 256kbps\r\nSOURCE........: Blu Ray\r\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG   \r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2016-06-08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:404a21e5c122ad7f9d74ff863df3af40cf71eea4","amp;dn":"The.Happiness.of.The.Katakuris.2001.1080p.BluRay.x264.AC3-SARTRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"404a21e5c122ad7f9d74ff863df3af40cf71eea4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,74,33,229,193,34,173,127,157,116,255,134,61,243,175,64,207,113,238,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
