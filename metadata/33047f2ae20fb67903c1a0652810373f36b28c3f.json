Personal opinion? The folks who made it? They knew that when they made it. To star in this movie, again my opinion, you needed to meet three criteria ... #1: You had to own your own Goth style clothing and jewelry. Makes wardrobe both easier and cheaper that way. #2: You had to be able to remember and repeat your lines with out cue cards. Note that I didn&amp;#039;t say you had to do it well. Saves on time and paper work. #3: You had to be willing to get naked. Gives an R rating and thus bolsters sales. Want to watch a better movie? Easy. Get a camera and some of your buddies together and do it yourself. Trust me, you won&amp;#039;t do any worse. As vampire movies go, well, this one sucks. And a hint here for people like me who like to look for little oddities in movies ... Consider the link between vampires and crosses. Now, take a look at the symbols and names on the headstones in the cemetery portions of this thing were filmed in. Ed Wood couldn&amp;#039;t have planned that kind of an accident any better himself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33047f2ae20fb67903c1a0652810373f36b28c3f","amp;dn":"Barely+Legal+Lesbian+Vampires%3A+The+Curse+of+Ed+Wood%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33047f2ae20fb67903c1a0652810373f36b28c3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,4,127,42,226,15,182,121,3,193,160,101,40,16,55,63,54,178,140,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
