It discusses the various designs and operations in a gas processing facility. As an introduction, the book provides different concepts and theories that describe the gas processing industry. It then discusses the processes involved in the gas processing industry, which include absorption, adsorption, glycol regeneration, glycol filtration, and carbon purification. \nThe book is divided into three parts. The first part discusses some of the basic terms and concepts of gas dehydration. The second part focuses on the factors involved in the different gas-dehydration methods. It also describes the difference between absorption and adsorption, as well as the process involved in glycol dehydration. The last part of the book discusses the proper care, maintenance, and troubleshooting methods of glycol dehydration process. \nThis book is mainly designed for engineers, technologists, and operating personnel in the gas processing industry. Aside from engineers and process designers, readers who are interested in the different processes involved in gas dehydration will find this book a useful guide and reference.\nInclude hydrate prevention, chemical injection systems, hydrate inhibitor methods\nCondensation process, Glycol Regeneration and Molecular Sieves\nAn appendix provides the reader with additional exercises and solutions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32c1c55328b728e9194de29aa76848a4699f2274","amp;dn":"Gas+Dehydration+Field+Manual+%28Elsevier%2C+2011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32c1c55328b728e9194de29aa76848a4699f2274","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,193,197,83,40,183,40,233,25,77,226,154,167,104,72,164,105,159,34,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
