Most of them have been downloaded from the CBC.ca podcast site.  Some have been ripped from a few of the cdÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s I had.  IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve edited all the id3 tags so ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more organized.  Hope you enjoy these as much as I do!\n\n\n\n\nThe Vinyl Cafe is an hour-long radio variety show, hosted by Stuart McLean and broadcast on CBC radio, BBC Radio 7 and on several U.S. public radio stations. It airs Sunday at noon on Radio One and Saturday at 10 a.m. on Radio Two, and is also available as a podcast, although the podcasts are usually just McLean's stories, but full episodes are occasionally released. The show features essays, weird stuff, fiction and music; while frequently humorous, the weekly programs are also often wistfully nostalgic. The show also endeavours to introduce listeners to new Canadian musical talent.\n\nThe show is independently produced by McLean and sold to the CBC. Each season has approximately 22 new episodes. Half of those are recorded in the studio and the other half are done with live audiences in theatres across Canada.\n\nA major feature of many of McLean's shows are the &quot;Dave and Morley Stories,&quot; featuring a fictional Toronto family. The name &quot;Vinyl Cafe&quot; refers both to the show's musical content, and the fictional record shop owned by McLean's character Dave. This aspect of the show has spawned a number of books of short stories, as well as audio recordings.\nEvery episode ends with McLean's signature signoff, &quot;I'm Stuart McLean, so long for now,&quot; followed by the show's folksy guitar theme song, &quot;Happy Meeting In Glory&quot; (as performed by Ry Cooder). The show is produced by Jess Milton. Meg Masters is the long-suffering story editor and the show's founding producer is Dave Amer.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c6b2dfa314e76326981efe1076752ddfbcb3123","amp;dn":"The+Vinyl+Cafe+with+Stuart+Mclean","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c6b2dfa314e76326981efe1076752ddfbcb3123","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,107,45,250,49,78,118,50,105,129,239,225,7,103,82,221,251,203,49,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
