Flooring audience after audience in crowded bars around the province, the band quickly proved them selves to be one of the premiere live acts in the area.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35a36a287fea03bdabd227bafc4cf2f6fe01fd60","amp;dn":"Matt+Mays+%26+El+Torpedo+-+Terminal+Romance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35a36a287fea03bdabd227bafc4cf2f6fe01fd60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,163,106,40,127,234,3,189,171,210,39,186,252,76,242,246,254,1,253,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
