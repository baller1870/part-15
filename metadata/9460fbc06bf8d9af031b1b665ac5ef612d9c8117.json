Think you have what it takes to join Skipper, Kowalski, Rico, and Private in a TOP SECRET mission? The boys and I have been perfecting years of secret agent speed, agility, lightning reflexes, and finding the perfect Cheesy Dibbles (critical in any mission). In our latest adventures, Penguins of Madagascar: Dibble Dash, we battle Dave the Octopus in an endless runner adventure like no other! \n\nUsing quick, Penguin-like reflexes, swipe to control all four Penguins at once as they navigate through intricate courses and alleyways! YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to move like Rico, think like Kowalski and learn like Private all while keeping it cool like me, Skipper, to keep the Penguins safe from DaveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mutant-creating goo. Remember, physical strength will only get you so far. As Kowalski might say - brains are an important part of this operation. \n\nFeatures \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Practice Math with the Penguins! Ã¢â‚¬â€ This mission isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t all brawn- youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need to use your brain as well. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division Ã¢â‚¬â€ just a few of the essential math topics players can practice while playing this endlessly fun game. There is also more educational content on the way! \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Use Power Ups for an extra boost! Ã¢â‚¬â€ KowalskiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s put together some special Power Ups to help you escape from tight situations.

Ã¢â‚¬â€ Put your training to the test as you outrun the octopus henchmen and avoid the mutant-creating goo. If all the Penguins turn into mutants, the game ends! \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Complete Daily Missions for more points!
