Walk to the Point\n2. On and On - Dave Mason, Doheny, Ned\n3. To Be Free\n4. Here We Go Again - Dave Mason, Garo, Bryan\n5. Pleasing You\n6. Sit and Wonder\n7. Something to Make You Happy\n8. Too Much Truth, Too Much Love\n9. Next to You - Dave Mason, Garo, Bryan\n10. Glittering Facade\n\n\nAlbum from the Traffic singer/guitarist and one fourth of The Mamas &amp; The Papas. Originally planned as a Dave Mason solo album, it is certainly one of his finest and coupling him with Cass Elliot was an utter stroke of genius, as she goes from being &quot;just&quot; producer and backing vocalist to being the shining guest star of the album. Cass provides excellent background vocals on her non-lead songs alongside sister Leah Kunkel making up an impressive harmony stack. The album is propelled by Mason's superb songwriting talents and tracks such as 'On and On', 'Walk to the Point', and several others bear this out. His guitar playing is some of his finest recorded work, especially the epic 'Glittering FaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¡ade', where he layers acoustic and electric guitars to a scintillating effect. Rev-Ola.
