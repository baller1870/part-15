Everything Before 6:36\n\n  With the illuminated big head and all, Canadian producer Joel ZimmermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Deadmau5 alias is a blast to see live, but you can also bring quite a bit of that tech-house-meets-slamminÃ¢â‚¬â„¢-electro excitement home with 4 x 4 = 12. As bad as the masked one is at math, he's conversely just as good at making you dance, as this unmixed but almost non-stop set of big room tunes throbs and snaps with that Daft Punk sense of style. Rabid fans should be warned, though, that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve already heard the big highlights, as tracks like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Some Chords,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sofi Needs a Ladder,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the wicked Ã¢â‚¬Å“Animal Rights,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and others had been previously released on 12Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½s, but the remaining cuts are hardly filler. Unheard numbers such as the creepy Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cthulhu SleepsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the Wendy Carlos-like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Right This SecondÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ help to turn a club-oriented set of tunes into a well-rounded album, and when the one-two punch of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Raise Your WeaponÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“One Trick PonyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ introduce the Mau5Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s newfound love of dubstep, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got just enough variety. Miss Sofi (Sofia Toufa) and Greta Svabo Bech contribute vocals, while producers Wolfgang Gartner and Michael Woods skillfully help with the knob twiddling.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8721200e0fc7dcf7ac6fb6749b09094025144359","amp;dn":"Deadmau5+-+4+x+4+%3D+12+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8721200e0fc7dcf7ac6fb6749b09094025144359","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,33,32,14,15,199,220,247,172,111,182,116,155,9,9,64,37,20,67,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
