NullDC requires the latest version of Microsoft DirectX, the latest Visual C++ runtime libraries and optionally WinPcap for modem emulation. As usual for emulators, a dump of the original console BIOS is also needed. It has a plugin architecture, with several alternative implementations (some ported from Chankast) for graphics, sound, reading games burned to CD-ROMs (it cannot read GD-ROMs directly) or disk image files, memory cards, etc.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34700115e85edb233ffe9650481fe8eb523da233","amp;dn":"Dreamcast+Emulator+nullDC+v1.0.4+r141+plugins+%2B+bios+%2B+vmu+%28late","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34700115e85edb233ffe9650481fe8eb523da233","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,112,1,21,232,94,219,35,63,254,150,80,72,31,232,235,82,61,162,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
