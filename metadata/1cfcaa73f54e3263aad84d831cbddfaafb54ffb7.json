But Hellman chooses to overlook the familiarity of his themes, producing a film every bit as committed to its dangerous corner of the world as its predecessor. In one of the best performances of his career, Warren Oates plays a seasoned cockfighter who, because unwise words once cost him a chance at a championship, has taken a vow of silence until he can correct the mistake. After apparently bottoming out following a devastating loss to friendly rival Harry Dean Stanton in the opening sequence, Oates renews ties with an old lover (Patricia Pearcy) who has kept herself removed from the sport, then begins to rebuild his cockfighting career. The plot never thickens much beyond that, but it never needs to. Oates' portrayal of a backwater existential hero slowly reveals a state of mind in which money, houses, and (most) women are valuable only as stakes in his game. Beautifully shot by NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©stor Almendros and unmistakably filmed on location using real participants in the cockfighting underground, Hellman's not-always-simulated fight scenes will make the film rough going for anyone who likes animals, but it's tough to deny Cockfighter's effectiveness. What it lacks in Blacktop's dreamlike atmosphere, it matches in grit and a similarly resigned tone. One of the great character actors, Oates wrings more from his silent performance than many actors could manage from a sheaf of Shaw and Wilde, and in addition to Hellman's insightful commentary, the DVD pays tribute with the revealing, if clip-intensive, documentary Warren Oates: Across The Border. Producer Roger Corman chose to bring pulp master Charles Willeford's novel Cockfighter to the screen because it exploited a sport whose worldwide popularity nearly matched its notoriety. What he got instead (as happened remarkably often with directors used to working the margins) was an off-kilter, unforgettable art film created from equal parts celluloid, philosophy, and blood.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard01-33.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard01-33.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard02-33.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard02-33.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard03-34.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard03-34.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard04-34.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard04-34.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard05-30.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard05-30.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard06-21.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard06-21.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n----my rip------\n\n~~~~~~ Cockfighter.avi ~~~~~~\n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,303,502,848\n\n--- Video Information ---\nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:23:27\nFrame Count:....................................120028\nFrame Width (pixels):...........................688\nFrame Height (pixels):..........................384\nAspect Ratio:...................................1.792\nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1684\n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.266&quot;\n\n--- Audio Information ---\nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................192\nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR\nAudio Channel Count:............................2 \n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
