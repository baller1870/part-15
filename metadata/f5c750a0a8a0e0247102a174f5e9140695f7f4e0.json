The ten-track album was produced by Blue RodeoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Greg Keelor and is the first part of a two part album. Morning Comes includes single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Count On MeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢  and an eight minute epic called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Bound To Your Own VicesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. Cuff The Duke are also excited to announce a tour of Western Canada. The alt-country road-warriors will hit the road on October 20th in Thunder Bay (full list of dates below). More Canadian dates will be announced soon.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThese albums are about dealing with loss of someone and the change that brings to oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Wayne Petti. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe confusion and loneliness that occurs at that point in someoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life. Coming to grips with the reality of those things. By the end of this record we start to make peace with this and come to terms with it. All these songs are about that. They deal with a similar theme and emotion but still wondering in the back of our minds whether there will be a point to all of it. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what the second record will be about. Embracing what has happened and navigating down new roads. This album is the low and the next album will be the high.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\ncd ripped by someone who has EAC,thankyou\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/10/21/cuff-the-duke/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/10/21/cuff-the-duke/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5c750a0a8a0e0247102a174f5e9140695f7f4e0","amp;dn":"Cuff+the+Duke...Morning+Comes%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5c750a0a8a0e0247102a174f5e9140695f7f4e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,199,80,160,168,160,224,36,113,2,161,116,245,233,20,6,149,247,244,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
