But the risk has more or less paid off. Tracks such as &quot;Blind&quot; and &quot;Hollow Life&quot; work best in this new contextÃƒÂ»ÃƒÂ»each filled with a sense of drama but not melodrama, their essential emotional weight is given new heft by opting for intense calm rather than an epicÃƒÂ»ÃƒÂ»and overwroughtÃƒÂ»ÃƒÂ»musical maelstrom. Others, such as &quot;Twisted Transistor&quot; teeter on self-parody; a guest turn from Evanescence vocalist Amy Lee for &quot;Freak on a Leash&quot; is inspired, one from the Cure for &quot;Make Me Bad/In Between Days&quot; doesn't quite live up to its promise on paper. But the band's reading of Radiohead's &quot;Creep&quot; is heartfelt and true, making this unplugged endeavor worthwhile and truly entertaining.--Jedd Beaudoin\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Blind                                                [03:30]\n02.Hollow life                                          [03:25]\n03.Freak on A leash (feat. amy lee from evanescence)    [03:56]\n04.Falling away from me                                 [03:56]\n05.Creep                                                [03:51]\n06.Love song                                            [03:51]\n07.Got the life                                         [03:48]\n08.Twisted transistor                                   [03:01]\n09.Coming undone                                        [03:35]\n10.Make me bad , in between days (feat. the cure)       [05:36]\n11.Throw me away                                        [06:20]\n________\n44:49 min\n 68,4 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.  You know who you are.\nWe dedicate this small space to an RIAA snitcher/c0kewh0re by the name of Jax. She thinks it's perfectly okay to publish personal details on other people and solicit illegal actions from even more people. We felt we'd give her a taste of her own medicine. Btw, Her husband is the infamous Bear Bottoms from alt.comp.freeware; a former cocaine drug smuggling pilot; If you're in need of the white stuff, We suspect her husband might be able to hook you up.\nJust give them a call or stop by.
