Remarkable for its focus on characterization and detail, Rat-Trap is set in rural Kerala. Its story concerns Unni, the last male-heir of a feudal and decaying joint family. Unni's inability to accept the socio-economic changes of a new society result in his gradual withdrawal into a metaphorical rat-trap sprung from his own isolation and paranoia. This is the first-ever DVD release of this important and award-winning Indian film.[/QUOTE]\n\n[QUOTE]Elippathayam ( Rat Trap) is the third film by Adoor and is supposed to be the first one to bring him international acclaim. However, this is first time I saw any of his films and I was taken aback at the way the movie begins. A household of three a brother and two grown up sisters are disturbed from their sleep as a rat's bites the brother. Immediately followed one of the most OTT scenes I ever witnessed. The three of them run to and fro in the house trying to catch the rat. We see only their legs and hear a weird background score. I was shocked at all this. I had taken considerable pains to come to watch this movie at NFAI and I was like WTF!. Is this a film by the Great Adoor , the director who's supposed to have made 9 PERFECT films in his 43 year career, the man considered to be the heir of Satyajit Ray in the Indian Cinema? But soon my fears were put to rest as the film seemed to have come to senses and everything was shown perfectly. It was as if I was a member of this small family and am watching whats going on the lives of Rajamma ,an over aged unmarried girl who does all the household chores, a college going Sridevi and their brother Unni. The film looks at Unni, played brilliantly by Karamana Janardhan Nair, who's the head of this family and is stubborn, narcissistic,feudalistic and an escapist to the core. And much more. According to the director the film is a &quot;a detailed study of a character at many levels -- psychological, physical, social, even genetic, based on his roots. I gave primary colors to the characters' clothes and a predominant gray to the background. &quot;[/QUOTE] &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/11-8.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/11-8.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/22-8.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/22-8.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/33-7.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/33-7.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/44-7.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/44-7.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/55-8.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/55-8.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/66-8.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/66-8.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----my rip----\n\nincludes interview in English with director\n\n~~~~~~ Elippathayam.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,679,812,608                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:55:54                \nFrame Count:....................................173837             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................640                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................464                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.379                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................25.000          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1787                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.241&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................133                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............VBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2        \n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
