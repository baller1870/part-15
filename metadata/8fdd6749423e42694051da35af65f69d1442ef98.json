64 MiB or more recommended\n* Non-volatile storage medium - standard ATA/IDE interface controller and drive (SCSI and USB controllers and drives are not supported; RAID controllers that require additional drivers are not supported; SATA is only supported in legacy access mode) with minimum of 64 Mb space; Flash and Microdrive devices may be connected using an adapted with ATA interface\n\nMIPS Hardware requirements\n\n* Supported systems - RouterBOARD 500 series (532, 512 and 511)\n* RAM - minimum 32 MiB\n* Non-volatile storage medium - onboard NAND device, minimum 64Mb\n\nHardware needed for installation time only\n\nDepending on installation method chosen the router must have the following hardware:\n\n* Floppy-based installation - standard AT floppy controller and 3.5'' disk drive connected as the first floppy disk drive (A); AT, PS/2 or USB keyboard; VGA-compatible video controller card and monitor\n* CD-based installation - standard ATA/ATAPI interface controller and CD drive supporting &quot;El Torito&quot; bootable CDs (you might need also to check if the router's BIOS supports booting from this type of media; if El Torito is not supported by the BIOS, you can still boot up from the CD using Smart Boot Manager Floppy); AT, PS/2 or USB keyboard; VGA-compatible video controller card and monitor\n* Floppy-based network installation - standard AT floppy controller and 3.5'' disk drive connected as the first floppy disk drive (A); PCI Ethernet network interface card supported by MikroTik RouterOS (see the Device Driver List for the list)\n* Full network-based installation - PCI Ethernet network interface card supported by MikroTik RouterOS (see the Device Driver List for the list) with PXE or EtherBoot extension booting ROM (you might need also to check if the router's BIOS supports booting from network)\n\nConfiguration possibilities\n\nRouterOS provides powerful command-line configuration interface. You can also manage the router through WinBox - the easy-to-use remote configuration GUI for Windows -, which provides all the benefits of the command-line interface, without the actual &quot;command-line&quot;, which may scare novice users. Web-based configuration is provided for some most popular functionality. Major features:\n\n* Clean and consistent user interface\n* Runtime configuration and monitoring\n* Multiple connections\n* User policies\n* Action history, undo/redo actions\n* safe mode operation\n* scripts can be scheduled for executing at certain times, periodically, or on events. All command-line commands are supported in scripts\n\nRouter may be managed through the following interfaces (note that until a valid IP configuration is enteres, telnet and SSH connections are not possible):\n\n* Local teminal console - AT, PS/2 or USB keyboard and VGA-compatible video controller card with monitor\n* Serial console - any (you may choose any one; the first, also known as COM1, is used by default) RS232 asynchronous serial port, which is by default set to 9600bit/s, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control\n* Telnet - telnet server is running on 23 TCP port by default\n* SSH - SSH (secure shell) server is running on 22 TCP port by default (available only if security package is installed)\n* MAC Telnet - MikroTik MAC Telnet potocol server is by default enabled on all Ethernet-like interfaces\n* Winbox - Winbox is a RouterOS remote administration GUI for Windows, that uses 8291 TCP port. It may also connect routers by their MAC addresses ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fdd6749423e42694051da35af65f69d1442ef98","amp;dn":"Mikrotik+2.9.26+With+Crack+Fix.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fdd6749423e42694051da35af65f69d1442ef98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,221,103,73,66,62,66,105,64,81,218,53,175,101,246,157,20,66,239,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
