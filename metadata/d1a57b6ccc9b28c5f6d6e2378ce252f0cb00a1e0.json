Progress in this field has been rapid and gene therapy promises to further extend personalized cancer treatment. In this volume leading experts have contributed their experience in developing gene therapies for a variety of cancers. Translational gene therapy approaches are emphasized. Chapters include discussions of specific gene delivery technologies as well as their application to various cancers with extensive discussions of ongoing clinical trials. This information should be useful to both students, fellows, and experienced scientists with an interest in this rapidly developing area.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1a57b6ccc9b28c5f6d6e2378ce252f0cb00a1e0","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2010%5D+Gene-Based+Therapies+for+Cancer+%28Current+Cancer+Res","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1a57b6ccc9b28c5f6d6e2378ce252f0cb00a1e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,165,123,108,204,155,40,197,246,214,226,55,140,226,82,240,203,0,161,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
