The album produced one hit single Passion; that proved particularly popular in South Africa  It also reached No. 5 on the US Billboard Charts. Later in 1981, Stewart added further elements of New Wave and synth pop to his sound for the Tonight I'm Yours album. The title song reached no.20 in the U.S., while Young Turks reached the Top 5 with the album going platinum. In August 1981, MTV was launched in the US with several of StewartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s videos in heavy rotation. On 18 December 1981, Stewart played the Los Angeles Forum, along with Kim Carnes and Tina Turner. This show was broadcast around the world to a television audience of 35 million. His career then went into a relative slump, and his albums between Tonight I'm Yours (1981) and Out of Order (1988) received harsh criticism from many critics. He was also criticised for breaking the widely observed cultural boycott of apartheid South Africa by performing at the Sun City resort complex in the bantustan of Bophuthatswana as part of his Body Wishes (1983) and Camouflage (1984) tours. The Camouflage album went gold in the UK, and the single Infatuation (which featured his old friend Jeff Beck on the guitar) received considerable play on MTV. In January 1985, he performed at the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro before an estimated audience of over 100,000. His performance during a stormy night was described by Stewart himself as winning the world soccer championship. Rhythm of My Heart from The Vagabond Heart album 1991 reached the Top Five and The Motown Song reached the Top 10 in the US.\nStewart was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.\n\n\nCD1 Foolish Behaviour 1980\n\n 1.
