However, the straight BBC rip had a couple of problems. The first was the fact that it was a NTSC-&gt;PAL conversion which had been done incorrectly, resulting in blended/junk frames. Another problem was the PAL speed. Finally, the color was off, which frequently happens during the NTSC-&gt;PAL process.\n\nI took this rip and distributed it to a couple of AV techs, who helped by removing the junk frames, correcting the color, and formatting it to a ready-to-burn NTSC DVD. I figured I would post it here so that anyone who wants it can have it. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0c39cf988d3576e8c542d7a64e14a63661fb329","amp;dn":"Song+of+the+South+-+Restored+and+Cleaned+Up+BBC+HD+Broadcast","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0c39cf988d3576e8c542d7a64e14a63661fb329","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,195,156,249,136,211,87,110,140,84,45,122,100,225,74,99,102,31,179,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
