This sequence also provides the history of the gameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s setting: in 2057, the depletion of EarthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s resources coincided with widening space exploration. After a catastrophic war over ever-declining resources, ending 10 years prior to the events of G-Police, EarthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s governments were stripped of military power. As a result, powerful corporations had exerted control over Earth and the burgeoning space colonies. The Government Police (G-Police) was formed by EarthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s remaining coalition government to maintain order in these colonies.\nIn the latter part of the introductory sequence, Slater, the game's protagonist, introduces himself as a war veteran who had joined the G-Police to conduct his own investigation of his sisterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s apparent suicide, suspecting that she was murdered. He also provides his view of the G-Police, stating they lack authority and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œturn a blind eyeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œshady corporate dealsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ while attempting to maintain order. He describes the Havoc gun-ships as outdated and the pilots as a mixture of desperate war veterans and naÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ve idealists.\n\nPLOT:\nThe early levels of the game depict Slater combating enemy gangs. The G-Police suspect &quot;Krakov&quot; corporation is supplying the gangs with weaponry. KrakovÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s president however is subsequently the subject of an assassination attempt by the gangs. During this attempt, Tachikawa (a pilot whom Slater describes as flying his gun-ship &quot;like he was born in it&quot;) dies when his gun-ship crashes after mysteriously malfunctioning. In the interests of morale, his death is covered up; Slater notes this incident is reminiscent of ElaineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death.\nAfter numerous terrorist attacks on their personnel and property, Krakov blames a rival corporation, &quot;Nanosoft&quot;, and begins openly attacking them with its private army. Lacking evidence for involvement with the criminal gangs, the G-Police protect Nanosoft, ultimately destroying KrakovÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s military power. The latter half of the game depicts a conflict between the G-Police and NanosoftÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s private forces, which attack G-Police after KrakovÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s collapse.\nIn the unfolding plot, the player learns that Tachikawa and SlaterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sister, Elaine, were killed (by the sabotage of their gun-ships) to procure microchips implanted in their brains. These chips can record a pilot's knowledge and combat skills; Nanosoft desired them to power the artificial intelligence in their weapons. The G-Police commander Horton is assassinated by Slater's traitorous wingman Ricardo, also to this end. The game ends with the destruction of a large spacecraft by Slater; the closing sequence reveals that Nanosoft had planned to use this to exert military dominance over other corporations.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe game involves piloting VTOL aircraft, described by critics as &quot;jet helicopters&quot; or &quot;a helicopter without the rotors&quot;. The player can choose to view the action from a variety of first- or third-person perspectives, including views from within the cockpit, a variety of &quot;chase&quot; perspectives, including directly from above the craft (for use when bombing). Combat in G-Police involves both dogfighting with other aircraft and dropping bombs. The player is often required to &quot;scan&quot; suspect vehicles to determine if they are criminal or hostile. The game's aircraft comes with numerous weapons which are upgraded as the player progresses to more difficult levels. An improved version of the basic &quot;Havoc&quot; aircraft is also available later in the game. Missions include seeking out and destroying enemies, escorting friendly ground units, preventing smuggling and bomb disposal. The player receives updates and new instructions as the mission proceeds. The main game mode features 35 missions and an additional training mode. Most of the game's mission take place in urban &quot;domes&quot; filled with large buildings; some, however, take place in the &quot;outer domes&quot;, with other themes such as agrarian settings.\n------------\n------------\n------------\n\nG-Police: Weapons of Justice:\nthe sequel to the game G-Police, a vehicle-based shooter for the PlayStation. Produced by Psygnosis and released in 1999, this game picked up the story from where the first game ended, and provided three new vehicles and numerous new weapons for the player to use in the 30 missions.\n\nPLOT:\nAfter the corporation wars of the first game, Slater is now a veteran pilot within the G-Police. However, the gangs that lay dormant during the battles between Nanosoft and G-Police have now emerged once again, and the weakened G-Police are struggling to contain them. The United Earth Marine Corps has sent units to assist in enforcing peace upon Callisto, but until they arrive Slater has to do his best to fight the tide. And when the Marines do arrive, the trouble is only just beginning...\nAfter initially aiding the G-Police in their battles against the gangs, the Marines suddenly turn against them. Commander Grice of the Marines, now in control of his own army, attempts to quickly crush the G-Police and take over Callisto, and then move to attack Earth itself. Slater and the G-Police manage to resist and, with the help of Earth-loyal Marine defectors, then beat back his revolution. Grice sabotages the communication devices that allow the colony to communicate with Earth. Grice retreats from Callisto and heads for the safety of space, but Slater leads the assault of a small force of space-capable vessels, Corsairs stolen from the Marine bases, and attempts to destroy Grice's fleet as it retreats. However, despite capturing the Barrossa and using it to cripple the Talavera, G-Police are simply too few to prevent Grice from escaping on his third battleship, the Excelsior. The Marine force continue to head towards Earth - and the G-Police have no way of warning the homeworld in time. Despite the odds, Slater and his crew prepare to follow Grice and hope to delay or outrun him as they both race for Earth, leaving the series open to a third sequel.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nFor the most part, the game handles only slightly differently from the original: the controls have been changed slightly to allow vehicles to strafe and fire two weapons at once, although they can no longer lock on to enemy craft, retreat and bombard them with missiles from afar. Missions are once again linear - they must be completed in a certain order, and key objectives must be achieved or the mission is failed. They are accompanied by secondary missions which are optional.\nThe greatest change comes in the form of the three new vehicles: as well as the Havoc and Venom gunships, there is the Rhino (an armed car, which was playable in a training level for G-Police 1 but lacked the armament that it boasts in Weapons of Justice), the Raptor (a heavily armed and armoured bipedal tank, capable of jumping and gliding) and the Corsair (a Marine spaceship, used in the final levels to pursue Grice's armada beyond the atmosphere). However, the mission dictates which vehicle must be used - the player cannot decide for themselves.\nThe game has 25 weapons, the majority of which are unique to specific vehicles. The vehicles primary cannon can be fired with the Square button and has an infinite amount of ammunition, although they do need to recharge after extended periods of use. The Circle button uses the ships secondary weapons, such as bombs, missiles ( both guided and unguided ), rockets or an electronic jammer. Throughout the game, you are often accompanied by a wingman or an armoured ground team. These can be used as a weapon by locking on to targets and pressing the secondary fire button.\nThe game also has 35 different types of enemy vehicle to engage. They come in different forms, such as SAM systems, corsairs, armoured APCs, droids and large Gunboats.30 missions are included in the game, all of which must be completed in a linear order. They vary greatly from patrolling the domes of Callisto, protecting important assets, carrying out bombing raids or simply engaging and destroying enemy forces. Weapons of Justice also includes new training and special missions, unrelated to the game's plot ( with several exceptions which act as bonus material between the main missions ), as well as bonus artwork and features which are unlocked as you progress through the game and fulfill secondary missions.\n--------------\n--------------\n--------------\n\nSERIES:\nThe original game, G-Police, was released in 1997 by Psygnosis and Wheelhaus. The original PlayStation game was spread over two disks due to the numerous FMV's that were shown throughout the game - in contrast, most of WoJ's cut-scenes use in-game graphics, making them look distinctly inferior. While the original G-Police has 35 missions (plus 5 secret missions) compared to WoJ's 30, the sequel also has 15 training and special missions that are unlocked through playing the game and completing secondary objectives.\nWeapons of Justice ends with a hook for the sequel, but a third installment was never created and the game's production team has now been disbanded. The games generally received good reviews, but did not prove popular enough to be continued.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHELP ME SEED MY LOW-SEEDED TORRENTS SO I CAN UPLOAD MORE AND NOT WORRY ABOUT THE OLD ONES!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDon't forget to snag a copy of my Land of the Dead torrent (you can play it online).\n\n\nI HAVE A FEW ONLINE PLAYABLE TORRENTS SO FAR:\nLand of the Dead\nPostal 1 and Postal 2 Share The Pain (All Mods)\nSniper Elite\nSerious Sam: The First and Second Encounter\nNexuiz\nDoom Collection (all the older doom games)  NOTE: This Requires a mod to play online (skulltag), it's free, google it\nOTHERS CAN MOST LIKELY BE PLAYED VIA HAMACHI\n\n\nDOWNLOAD ALL MY TORRENTS HERE:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbb7faa08af3fed40fbb9208c4afb93bc2f0fc70","amp;dn":"G-Police+1%2C+and+2+Weapons+of+Justice+%28PSX%29+%28PS1%29+%28Use+ePSXe%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbb7faa08af3fed40fbb9208c4afb93bc2f0fc70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,183,250,160,138,243,254,212,15,187,146,8,196,175,185,59,194,240,252,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
