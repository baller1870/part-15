It was released in 1988. The album is named after John Linnell and John Flansburgh's boyhood home of Lincoln, Massachusetts. The two men pictured are Linnell's great-grandfather, Lewis T. Linnell (left) and Flansburgh's maternal grandfather, Brigadier General Ralph Hospital (right).\n\nLincoln's lyrics further elaborate the themes and surrealistic, wordplay-heavy style of They Might Be Giants (&quot;Shoehorn With Teeth&quot;), but include more songs about troubled romantic relationships (&quot;Ana Ng&quot;, &quot;They'll Need a Crane&quot;, &quot;I've Got a Match&quot;), and some songs that verge on social or political satire (&quot;Purple Toupee&quot;, &quot;Pencil Rain&quot;, &quot;Kiss Me, Son of God&quot;). Lincoln is a more technically polished album than They Might Be Giants, making heavier use of what would become TMBG's signature instrument, Linnell's accordion. Hints of jazz (&quot;Lie Still, Little Bottle&quot;) and sea shanties (&quot;Mr. Me&quot;, &quot;Cowtown&quot;) are added to the previous album's wide-ranging musical influences.\n\nDespite its primitive sound (the duo would eventually take on a backing band with live drums), this do-it-yourself effort is widely considered by critics to be the band's defining musical statement.\n\nThis album is included in Then: The Earlier Years, a compilation of the band's early material, in its entirety.\n\n\n\nThey Might Be Giants - Lincoln FLAC+CUE+ARTWORK\nLabel: Restless Records, Bar/None Records \nCatalog#: 7 72600-2, 7 72600-2 \nFormat: CD, Album\nCountry: US \nReleased: Nov 1988 \nGenre: Rock \nStyle: Alternative Rock, Pop Rock \nCredits: Artwork By [Cover Art] - Brian Dewan \nEngineer - Al Houghton \nPerformer, Written-By - John Flansburgh , John Linnell \nProducer - Bill Krauss \nNotes: Recorded and mixed in Times Square at Dubway Studio. \nPublished by They Might Be Giants Music [ASCAP] \nAll lyrics Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©1988 They Might Be Giants. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã¢â‚¬â€Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 1988 They Might Be Giants \nManufactured in USA. \nPrinted in Canada. \nHub codes: &quot;MASTERED BY NIMBUS&quot;, &quot;72600-2 (V) :&quot; \nUPC: 0 1877-72600-2 2\n\nTrack listing:\n1. &quot;Ana Ng&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23 \n2. &quot;Cowtown&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:20 \n3. &quot;Lie Still, Little Bottle&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:06 \n4. &quot;Purple Toupee&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:40 \n5. &quot;Cage &amp; Aquarium&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:10 \n6. &quot;Where Your Eyes Don't Go&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:06 \n7. &quot;Piece of Dirt&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:00 \n8. &quot;Mr. Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:52 \n9. &quot;Pencil Rain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:42 \n10. &quot;The World's Address&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:24 \n11. &quot;I've Got a Match&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:36 \n12. &quot;Santa's Beard&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:55 \n13. &quot;You'll Miss Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:53 \n14. &quot;They'll Need a Crane&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:33 \n15. &quot;Shoehorn With Teeth&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:13 \n16. &quot;Stand on Your Own Head&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:16 \n17. &quot;Snowball in Hell&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:31 \n18. &quot;Kiss Me, Son of God&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:52 \n\n\nEnjoy &amp; thank you for seeding !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29d86898e08b4804fa6677a5378170829c229d7c","amp;dn":"They+Might+Be+Giants+%5B1988%5D+Lincoln","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29d86898e08b4804fa6677a5378170829c229d7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,216,104,152,224,139,72,4,250,102,119,165,55,129,112,130,156,34,157,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
