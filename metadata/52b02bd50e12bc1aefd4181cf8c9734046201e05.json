The chief suspect is another loner, a schizophrenic recently escaped from a mental institution. The only witness is a twelve-year-old boy, overweight, obsessed with archery, and a resident at a home for delinquents. When a demented man robs a nearby bank and accidentally takes the suspect hostage, the three misfits are drawn into an uneasy alliance. Shrewdly, patiently, as is his way, Inspector Sejer confronts a case where the strangeness of the crime is matched only by the strangeness of the criminals, and where small-town prejudices warp every piece of information he tries to collect.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52b02bd50e12bc1aefd4181cf8c9734046201e05","amp;dn":"He+Who+Fears+the+Wolf+by+Karin+Fossum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52b02bd50e12bc1aefd4181cf8c9734046201e05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,176,43,213,14,18,188,26,239,212,24,28,248,201,115,64,70,32,30,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
