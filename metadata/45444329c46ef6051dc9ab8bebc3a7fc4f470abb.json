The twenty-five letters are an account of a daring wartime trip to Scandinavia to attempt to retrieve a stolen ship for her lover, the American adventurer Gilbert Imlay. Her letters describe the people and culture she encountered, as well as the beautiful natural surroundings she observed. But in addition to a travelogue these letters include political reflections on controversial topics such as prison reform, as well as revealing a very personal story of inner turmoil and dislocation. Wollstonecraft's letters were written at a difficult period in her life - she had recently attempted suicide - and their themes and emotional content influenced the Romantic poets of the following generation, even though the book's initial popularity waned after her death","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45444329c46ef6051dc9ab8bebc3a7fc4f470abb","amp;dn":"Letters+written+in+Sweden%2C+Norway%2C+and+Denmark+-+Mary+Wollstonec","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45444329c46ef6051dc9ab8bebc3a7fc4f470abb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,68,67,41,196,110,246,5,29,201,171,139,235,195,167,252,79,71,10,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
