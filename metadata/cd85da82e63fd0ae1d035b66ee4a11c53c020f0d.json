Pitney is sometimes characterized (or dismissed) as a shallow teen idol-type prone to operatic ballads. It's true that some of his biggest hits -- &quot;Town Without Pity,&quot; &quot;Only Love Can Break a Heart,&quot; &quot;I'm Gonna Be Strong,&quot; &quot;It Hurts to Be in Love,&quot; and &quot;Twenty Four Hours From Tulsa&quot; -- are archetypes of adolescent or just-post-adolescent agony, characterized by longing and not a little self-pity.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gene-pitney-p5148/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gene-pitney-p5148/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Reviews:\n\n2 for 1\nAMG Review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\nSequel reissued the bulk of Gene Pitney's '60s albums for Musicor as a series of compact discs that contains two original albums each. Although the material on each disc is different, one basic pattern does emerge -- by and large, the singles were the best songs on each album, but the remaining songs, usually comprised of solid album tracks, covers and filler, are generally interesting to hardcore fans, since Pitney has such a uniquely dramatic voice. In other words, most fans will be satisfied by one of the many hits collections, but these discs are essential for serious fans and collectors.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/many-sides-of-gene-pitney-only-love-can-break-a-heart-r278225&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/many-sides-of-gene-pitney-only-love-can-break-a-heart-r278225&lt;/a&gt;\n\n==========\n\nThe Many Sides of Gene Pitney\nAMG Review by Richie Unterberger\n\nA bunch of early hits (&quot;Town Without Pity,&quot; &quot;I Wanna Love My Life Away,&quot; &quot;Every Breath I Take&quot;) form the core of this early LP, filled out by generally less impressive material, much of it written by Pitney. The secondary tracks are highlighted by his own version of his composition &quot;Hello Mary Lou&quot; (a hit for Rick Nelson), as well as &quot;Dream for Sale&quot; (co-written by Phil Spector), the dramatic &quot;Take Me Tonight,&quot; and &quot;Today's Teardrops&quot; (also done by Nelson and Roy Orbison). Most of the best tracks, however, are available on various best-of compilations.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-many-sides-of-gene-pitney-r46718&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-many-sides-of-gene-pitney-r46718&lt;/a&gt;\n\n========\n\nOnly Love Can Break a Heart\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/only-love-can-break-a-heart-r15304&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/only-love-can-break-a-heart-r15304&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000000PTS&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000000PTS&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
