Kingsley Ward\nHardcover: 225 pages\nPublisher: Distributor Eledaw Holdings; 1St Edition edition (1985)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0920283012\nISBN-13: 978-0002175814\n\nThis brief, encouraging book consists of a series of letters (edited for print) written by a successful businessman (Ward himself) to his son, tracking the son's career from a decision on which college to attend to the son's mid-career promotion to company president upon his father's retirement. During the 20-year span, the father shares with his son (and the reader) all of his wisdom on topics from business--work ethic, entrepreneurship, partnership, business expansion, diversification, teamwork, firing an employee, leadership, etc.; as well as life--challenge, success, integrity, marriage, money, manners, happiness, friendship, criticism, balance, etc.\nWard's advice is &quot;business conservative,&quot; with his basic message being: Set goals for yourself, work hard, be honest and block off time to enjoy your life a little. The selected decision points, problems and events in the son's life revolve around people, mainly working relationships with business associates, employees, customers, suppliers, bankers and competitors--all without neglecting family and friends. Ward emphasizes the importance of cultivating friendships, stating how &quot;Without doubt, friendship is the spice of life.&quot; However, when he opines how a person with more than three good friends should feel blessed, and how being rich is better than being poor, but also lonelier, he exhibits his realism and unveils a hint of quiet, unspoken regret: Do we all in our drive to achieve emphasize business and profit at the expense of humanity and friendship perhaps a little more than we should?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74105d53e88a894fdff3ac52882651760d058ff5","amp;dn":"Letters+from+a+businessman+to+his+son+-+G.Kingsley+Ward+%5BInua%5D.d","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74105d53e88a894fdff3ac52882651760d058ff5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,16,93,83,232,138,137,79,223,243,172,82,136,38,81,118,13,5,143,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
