A fourteenth-century Yuan dynasty (1279â€“1368) literati landscape painting presents a world that is totally different from that portrayed in the monumental landscape images of the early Sung dynasty (960â€“1279). To chronicle and explain the evolution from formal representation to self-expression is the purpose of this book. Wen C. Fong, one of the world's most eminent scholars of Chinese art, takes the reader through this evolution, drawing on the outstanding collection of Chinese painting and calligraphy in The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Focusing on 118 works, each illustrated in full color, the book significantly augments the standard canon of images used to describe the period, enhancing our sense of the richness and complexity of artistic expression during this six-hundred-year era","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d52160ece590da84d09eb7332535c97d51447c4","amp;dn":"Beyond+Representation-Chinese+Painting+and+Calligraphy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d52160ece590da84d09eb7332535c97d51447c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,82,22,14,206,89,13,168,77,9,235,115,50,83,92,151,213,20,71,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
