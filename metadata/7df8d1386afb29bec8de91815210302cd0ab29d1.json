This is a Retail Windows 7 Professional SP1 ISO, which means that there are no cracks, key generator, activator, or hacks. This is included with Service Pack 1, which is the latest for Windows 7. Also, this is a bootable image, so you won't face any problems during the setup. Also again, make sure you read the system requirements for Windows 7 x86. (Note: Don't Install This on a x64 Computer!
