According to an end of the century poll, professional philosophers in Canada and the U.S. rank both his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (TLP) and Philosophical Investigations among the top five most important books in twentieth-century philosophy, the latter standing out as &quot;...the one crossover masterpiece in twentieth-century philosophy, appealing across diverse specializations and philosophical orientations&quot;.[4] Wittgenstein's influence has been felt in nearly every field of the humanities and social sciences, yet there are widely diverging interpretations of his thought.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:018a7a903a71cb3177939edb32b88d908f098d17","amp;dn":"Paul+Strathern+-+Wittgenstein+in+90+minutes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"018a7a903a71cb3177939edb32b88d908f098d17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,138,122,144,58,113,203,49,119,147,158,219,50,184,141,144,143,9,141,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
