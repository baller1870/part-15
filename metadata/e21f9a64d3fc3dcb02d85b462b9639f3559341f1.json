One day, a classmate named Hitagi Senjougahara, who infamously never talks to anyone, falls down the stairs into Koyomi's arms. He discovers that Hitagi weighs next to nothing, in defiance of physics. After being threatened by her, Koyomi offers her help, and introduces her to Meme Oshino, a middle-aged homeless man who helped him stop being a vampire.\n\nIn each chapter of the series, he encounters a different heroine, each involved with a different &quot;apparition&quot;. The events of the previous chapters play an important role in the subsequent ones. The series primarily focuses on conversations between characters; it contains a fair number of parodies of other series, as well as Nisio Isin's trademark wordplay and metahumor.\n\n\nGenres:\nComedy, Supernatural\n\n\nProducers:\nStudio Shaft\n\nFansubbing Group:\nHorrible Fansubs\n\nBakemonogatari/Nisemonogatari\nVideo:\n\nFormat                                   : mp4\nLength                                   : 24:29\nFrame Width                              : 640/848\nFrame height                             : 352/480\nDate rate                                : 174kbps/325kbps\nTotal bitrate                            : 334kbps/357kbps\nFrame Rate                               : 23 frames/second\nBit depth                                : 8-bit\n\n\nAudio:\n\nBit rate                                 : 160kbps/32kbps\nChannels                                 : 2 (stereo)/1 (mono)\nAudio sample rate                        : 48 kHz/22kHz\n\nNote:\nNisemonogatari has better quality than Bakemonogatari.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e21f9a64d3fc3dcb02d85b462b9639f3559341f1","amp;dn":"Bakemonogatari%2BNisemonogatari+%5BComplete%5D+Eng+Subs+MP4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e21f9a64d3fc3dcb02d85b462b9639f3559341f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,31,154,100,211,252,61,203,2,216,91,70,43,150,57,243,85,147,65,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
