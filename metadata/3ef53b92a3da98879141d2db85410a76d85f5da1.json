On Sunday after Sunday, at bridal shower after bridal shower, they coo over toasters, collect ribbons and wrapping paper, eat minuscule sandwiches and cakes. They wear pastel dresses and drink champagne by the case, but amid the celebration these women have their own lives to contend with: Isabella is working a dead-end job, Mary is dating a nice guy with an awful mother, and Lauren is waitressing at a midtown bar and wondering why she's attracted to the sleazy bartender. \n\nWith a wry sense of humor, Jennifer Close brings us through those thrilling, bewildering years of early adulthood as she pulls us inside the circle of these friends, perfectly capturing the wild frustrations and soaring joys of modern life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ef53b92a3da98879141d2db85410a76d85f5da1","amp;dn":"Girls+in+White+Dresses+--+Jennifer+Close","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ef53b92a3da98879141d2db85410a76d85f5da1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,245,59,146,163,218,152,135,145,65,210,219,133,65,10,118,216,95,93,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
