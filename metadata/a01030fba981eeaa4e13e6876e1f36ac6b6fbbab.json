A recent theory suggests that they are and that the difference is due not to differences in opportunity but to race itself. Professor Eysenck examines the evidence in a purely factual way. He discusses what is meant by the words 'race' and 'intelligence' (neither of them as simple as they look) and surveys the latest research dealing with negro intelligence and with the whole question of inherited differences. He then discusses the conclusions to be drawn, and some widespread educational doctrines turn out to be based more on wishful thinking than on research. Professor Eysenck suggests that white people unquestionably owe negroes a reparation for the wrongs they have inflicted and continue to inflict on them, and the first duty they owe them is to base attempts to redress the balance on an objective assessment of the facts.\n\nH J Eysenck was born in Berlin during the First World War and grew up during a period of intense preoccupation with racial issues, 'Arian' superiority and persecution of the Jews. He left Germany a year or so after Hitler came to power and studied at Dijon and Exeter Universities before getting his degree and PhD in London, where he is now Professor of Psychology. He has taught in America on two occasions (Philadelphia and Berkeley) but has spent nearly all his life in the Department of Psychology, which he started shortly after the Second World War at the Institute of Psychiatry in the Maudsley Hospital, London. He has written something like twenty books and three hundred or so articles, and believes that the only solution to mankind's pressing problems lies in the advancement of scientific knowledge about Man himself.\n\n160 pages\nPublisher: Temple Smith (1973)\nASIN: B0014B9LV8\nISBN-10: 0851170099\nISBN-13: 978-0851170091","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a01030fba981eeaa4e13e6876e1f36ac6b6fbbab","amp;dn":"Race%2C+Intelligence+and+Education+%281973%29+by+Hans+J.+Eysenck","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a01030fba981eeaa4e13e6876e1f36ac6b6fbbab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,16,48,251,169,129,238,170,78,19,230,135,110,31,54,172,107,111,187,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
