Unlike the recent rash of groups that feel content to only rework the gothier monumentalism of Joy Division and its many followers, though, Working for a Nuclear Free City take more overt cues from the dance side of the city's history -- not just Section 25 and A Certain Ratio, but the full-on industrial hysteria typified by the Hacienda. After a brief atmospheric introduction, the album kicks into mesmerizing full gear with &quot;Troubled Son,&quot; at once as thick and druggy as Happy Mondays at its most gone and as crisp and pulsing as early 808 State. On balance the album is a captivating revisioning of the dance/rock promise of the city's late-'80s sound if it followed a much different but parallel path to Oasis' rock-uber-alles approach -- in particular, the percussion is multifaceted and often dramatic in place of a stolid if powerful plod. The circular breakdown concluding &quot;Dead Fingers Talking&quot; and the quick, skittering full-on funk drumming on &quot;Innocence&quot; (an even better take on psych/funk than the Stone Roses' ultimate high point &quot;Begging You&quot;) in particular shows this utterly welcome approach. When they do work in a more straightforward rock mode, the results can be equally gripping -- the flow and charge of &quot;Over&quot; is just astonishing, the best reworking of early Spiritualized's sound since that band itself. For all that, straight-up atmospherics aren't forgotten either, with numerous short pieces softly breaking the album's flow, sometimes instrumental and sometimes, as with &quot;England,&quot; with a few quick vocal parts. &quot;Quiet Place,&quot; meanwhile, is a contextual surprise and a half, a sweet and serene combination of softly sung vocals and electronica/shoegaze that finds its own unique place.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/working-for-a-nuclear-free-city-r861572/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/working-for-a-nuclear-free-city-r861572/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nCD1\n01 - 224th Day\n02 - Troubled Son\n03 - Dead Fingers Talking\n04 - Rocket\n05 - Kingdom\n06 - Sarah Dreams of Summer\n07 - Apron Strings\n08 - All American Taste\n09 - Quiet Place\n10 - So\n11 - England\n12 - Over\n13 - Fallout\n14 - Forever\n15 - Stone Cold\n\nCD2\n01 - Eighty Eight\n02 - Donkey\n03 - Get a Fucking Haircut\n04 - Innocence\n05 - Home\n06 - Heaven Kissing Hill\n07 - The Tape\n08 - Asleep At The Wheel\n09 - Pretty Police State\n10 - Soft Touch\n11 - Pixelated Birds\n12 - Je suis le vent\n13 - Nancy Adam Susan\n14 - The Tree\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de71fc4a1814ca20c3d74b93d7ade0f0ce995c56","amp;dn":"Working+For+A+Nuclear+Free+City+-+Businessmen+%26+Ghosts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de71fc4a1814ca20c3d74b93d7ade0f0ce995c56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,113,252,74,24,20,202,32,195,215,75,147,215,173,224,240,206,153,92,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
