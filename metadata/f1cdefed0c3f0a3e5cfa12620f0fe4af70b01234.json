Any man will drool over all the loving shots of now vanished automobile models. Ah, remember when you could buy a VW Camper Van for $800 ?\n\n\nA realistic police drama following the lives of two officers of the LAPD, veteran Pete Malloy and his rookie partner, Jim Reed. Done in a spare, almost &quot;docudrama&quot; style, each episode covered a variety of incidents that the officers encountered during a shift, from the tragic to the trivial. \n\n\n\n\nNOTE: for some reason I could not get these episodes to play on mobile players, but they play great on my computer with VLC. I have no idea","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1cdefed0c3f0a3e5cfa12620f0fe4af70b01234","amp;dn":"Adam+12+1968+Seasons+1+-+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1cdefed0c3f0a3e5cfa12620f0fe4af70b01234","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,205,239,237,12,63,10,62,92,250,18,98,15,15,228,175,112,176,18,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
