Manic and jostling, it flings a series of genres-- grime! crunk! electro! dub reggae! post-punk!-- in front of you like so many disorienting flashbulb pops. Father Creeper, his second full-length and his first for Sub Pop, is too frantic to find a groove, attempting to make a virtue of its messiness instead. But it is a wearying listen, overcrowded and too loud and too harsh, and to engage actively with it is to feel your knuckles whiten with effort. It feels like being trapped at a loud party where too many interesting people are talking over each other at once.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08d87df8bc50873d1401e4d43baa8dee3d836610","amp;dn":"Spoek+Mathambo+-+Father+Creeper+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08d87df8bc50873d1401e4d43baa8dee3d836610","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,216,125,248,188,80,135,61,20,1,228,212,59,170,141,238,61,131,102,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
