Syntrillium later released Cool Edit Pro, which added the capability to work with multiple tracks, as well as other features. \nAudio processing, however, was done in a destructive manner (at the time, most computers were not powerful enough in terms of processor performance and memory capacity to perform non-destructive operations in real time). \nCool Edit Pro v2 added support for real-time non-destructive processing, and v2.1 added support for surround sound mixing and unlimited simultaneous tracks (up to the limit imposed by the actual computer hardware). \nHere's the shit you need with installation instructions contained in txt file, enjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47236c58e6d0da17cfea7d1019c64bb3bbf13990","amp;dn":"Cool+Edit+Pro+2.1+%28+ver.+3097.0%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47236c58e6d0da17cfea7d1019c64bb3bbf13990","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,35,108,88,230,208,218,23,207,234,125,16,25,198,75,179,187,241,57,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
