In this brilliantly documented biography, the mythology that surrounded that life is disentangled from the truth. Hughes had always been different. Certainly his riches set him apart, but he was also tough. Orphaned and a millionaire at eighteen, Hughes repudiated his relatives, seized control of the Hughes Tool Company, the linchpin of his fortune, and went on to become a flamboyant movie producer, holder of many world aviation records, principal owner of Trans World Airlines, a critically important defense contractor, Hollywood's most pursued and elusive bachelor, and partner of the United States government. This is an epic biography of an epic figure who bestrode the world like a colossus yet could not master himself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e272f3d4240ef6cfa9a6bfdb8582bdbed39fee55","amp;dn":"Howard+Hughes%2C+Empire+-+Donald+L.+Bartlett+and+James+L.+Steele+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e272f3d4240ef6cfa9a6bfdb8582bdbed39fee55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,114,243,212,36,14,246,207,169,166,191,219,133,130,189,190,211,159,238,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
