Rollins is widely recognized as one of the most important and influential jazz musicians. \nA number of his compositions, including &quot;St. Thomas&quot; &quot;Oleo&quot; &quot;Doxy&quot; and &quot;Airegin&quot; have become jazz standards\n\nWhile Rollins was born in New York City, his parents were born in the United States Virgin Islands.Rollins \nreceived his first saxophone at age 13. He attended Benjamin Franklin High School in East Harlem. He said \nthat a concert by Frank Sinatra there, accompanied by a plea for racial harmony, changed his life.\n\nRollins started as a pianist, changed to alto saxophone, and finally switched to tenor in 1946. During \nhis high-school years, he played in a band with other future jazz legends Jackie McLean, Kenny Drew and \nArt Taylor.
