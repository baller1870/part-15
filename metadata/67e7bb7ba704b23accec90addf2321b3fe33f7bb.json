This is the film that Jules and Gedeon Naudet filmed in 2001 that started out as a documentry about a probie fireman in training for the New York Fire Department.\n \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_(film)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_(film)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n9/11 is a 2002 American documentary film about the September 11 attacks in New York City, in which two planes were deliberately crashed into the buildings of the World Trade Center as part of a wider terrorist conspiracy targeting New York City, The Pentagon in Washington D.C., and involving Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The film is from the point of view of the New York City Fire Department. The film was directed by Jules and Gedeon Naudet, and FDNY firefighter James Hanlon\n\n\nThis video was recorded off of a local CBS television network affiliate television station in the United States.\n\nThis video was recorded off of an OTA (Over The Air using a Television antenna for reception) television station which encountered a signal drop out during several parts of the recording. This resulted in pixelized images or a complete lose of the picture . This problem was successfully resolved by spicing in clips from the original CBS broadcast of the 2002 copy of the 9/11 film. There is a noticeable difference between the original chips and the 2011 clips. For instance, the CBS logo which has the appearance of an eyeball, is only present in the 2011 version of the film, while those lacking this logo were taken from the original 2002 version of the film--giving for the most part-- a complete copy of the film with no frames missing.\n\nFormat                                   : MPEG-PS\nFile size                                : 4.66 GB\nDuration                                 : 2hrs 3 min\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Variable\nOverall bit rate                         : 5 406 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 224 (0xE0)\nFormat                                   : MPEG Video\nFormat version                           : Version 2\nFormat profile                           : Main@Main\nFormat settings, BVOP                    : Yes\nFormat settings, Matrix                  : Custom\nFormat settings, GOP                     : Variable\nDuration                                 : 26mn 28s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 4 851 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                         : 9 330 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 4:3\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nStandard                                 : NTSC\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nScan order                               : Top Field First\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.468\nTime code of first frame                 : 00:00:00:00\nTime code source                         : Group of pictures header\nStream size                              : 919 MiB (90%)\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 189 (0xBD)-128 (0x80)\nFormat                                   : AC-3\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                           : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness              : Big\nMuxing mode                              : DVD-Video\nDuration                                 : 2 hrs 3 min\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 6 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nDelay relative to video                  : -3ms\nStream size                              : 84.8 MiB (8%)\n\nMenu= no menu","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67e7bb7ba704b23accec90addf2321b3fe33f7bb","amp;dn":"9-11_10+Years+Later_The+WTC+_TV+Documentry_2011_DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67e7bb7ba704b23accec90addf2321b3fe33f7bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,231,187,123,167,4,178,58,204,236,144,173,223,35,33,179,254,51,247,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
