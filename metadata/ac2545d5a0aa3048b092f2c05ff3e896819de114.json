Real estate and renovation experts, Property Brothers Drew and Jonathan Scott, come to the rescue and help the couple find a budget-friendly dream home that can be renovated on time. With a budget that doesn't match the couple's expectations, Drew and Jonathan struggle to sell the potential of a fixer-upper. The couple decides between two renovation projects, and the brothers have less than four weeks to overhaul the dining and living rooms, bathroom, and kitchen area. To stay within their budget Jonathan gets creative and recycles existing pieces. His stress levels skyrocket when the couple insists on a new fireplace, tin ceilings, and the kicker: a new move-in date of two weeks. Jonathan works around the clock but isn't sure he can pull it off in time.\n\nIf you see &quot;Hector&quot; on the end of a file it means I capped it.\nEnjoy, Gaz/Hector :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac2545d5a0aa3048b092f2c05ff3e896819de114","amp;dn":"My.Dream.Home.s02e11.PDTV.x264.Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac2545d5a0aa3048b092f2c05ff3e896819de114","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,37,69,213,160,170,48,72,176,146,242,192,95,243,232,150,129,157,225,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
