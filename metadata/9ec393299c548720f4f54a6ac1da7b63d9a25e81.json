The friendship\n          that we earn keeps us continuing every single day of the year ...\n          and it will go on like this. So we wanna say thank you to all the\n        ppl that helped us over the last 2 years ... siteops, groups and\n     any kind of sceners. In the  times of  flaming and  arrogance its a\n    luck to find ppl with the same attitude like we have. We  appreciate\n    your help and your support in any way.
