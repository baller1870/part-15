Rufus Fears, Ph.D., Harvard University,\nUniversity of Oklahoma\n\nJanuary 10, 49 B.C.: Julius Caesar crosses the Rubicon River into Rome, igniting a civil war that leads to the birth of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s greatest ancient civilization.\n\nOctober 12, 1492: The Spanish explorer Christopher Columbus, weary after months at sea, finally drops anchor at the island of San Salvador and takes EuropeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first steps into the New World.\n\nSeptember 11, 2001: On a calm Tuesday morning, a series of terrorist attacks on the United States of America ignites a global war on terrorism that continues to this day.\n\nHistory is made and defined by landmark events such as theseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½moments that irrevocably changed the course of human civilization. While many of us are taught that anonymous social, political, and economic forces are the driving factors behind events of the past, acclaimed historian and award-winning Professor J. Rufus Fears believes that itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s individuals, acting alone or together, who alter the course of history. These events have given us\n\n   * spiritual and political ideas,\n   * catastrophic battles and wars,\n   * scientific and technological advances,\n   * world leaders both influential and monstrous, and\n   * cultural works of unparalleled beauty.\n\nWithout them, human history as we know it today would be shockingly unfamiliar. In short, because of these events, our world would never be the same again.\n\nSuch is the approach of The World Was Never the Same: Events That Changed History, a captivating new course in which Professor FearsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a master storyteller and one of the most popular instructors on our Great Courses facultyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½provides you with 36 of the most important and definitive events in the history of the world. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an intriguing and engaging tour of thousands of years of human history, from the creation of the Code of Hammurabi (1750 B.C.) to the Battle of Lexington (April 19, 1775), to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Have a DreamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ speech (August 28, 1963), and beyond. And itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a chance for you to learn new insights about world history at the hands of an engaging historian.\n\nAn ExpertÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Guide to HistoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Greatest Moments\n\nSo what makes a particular historical event so defining?\n\nGuided by his decades of immersion in the study of the past, Professor Fears narrows down the massive span of human history into 36 of its most powerful events. Using his expert knowledge and his impressive ability to draw out invaluable lessons from the past, he has chosen the events for The World Was Never the Same based on these three criteria:\n\n   * The event in itself fundamentally changed history.\n   * The aftermath of the event changed history.\n   * The event and its impact still resonate with us today.\n\nThe result is a comprehensive and authoritative selection of events, each of which played a crucial role in transforming human civilization. WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more: Professor Fears avoids the common pitfall of treating his subject as a mere catalog or laundry list of eventsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½instead, he takes great care to make these lectures feel like a grand, epic narrative of human history.\n\n36 Defining Events, 36 Captivating Stories\n\nRight from the first lecture, Professor Fears takes you back to the dawn of civilization; from there, you hopscotch across more than 3,000 years of history around the world, from the ancient city-states of Mesopotamia and Greece to medieval Europe and colonial America to revolutionary Russia and China. In each instance, Professor Fears weaves a captivating story about each event: what led up to it, how it unfolded, and how the world was changed as a result. More important, he uses these 36 events as guides for both understanding the past and learning from it.\n\nWith The World Was Never the Same, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn about the importance of events that seem like logical choices, such as these:\n\n   * The trial of Jesus in A.D. 36, in which the spiritual message of this religious leader was forever immortalized and would lead to one of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s greatest world faiths\n   * The discovery of the New World on October 12, 1492, which ushered in a profound era of exploration and conquest that would revolutionize the economic and political balance of Europe and lead to the creation of the United States of America\n   * The Battle of Gettysburg on July 1ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“3, 1863, a pivotal battle in the American Civil War that would turn the tide in favor of the Union and the freedoms it sought to preserve\n   * The dropping of the first atomic bomb on August 6, 1945, which brought World War II to a swift conclusion but also signaled the start of the atomic age.\n\nProfessor Fears also makes compelling cases for events that you might not have considered to be so revolutionary:\n\n   * The creation of the Hippocratic Oath in 430 B.C., a pledge (still taken today) that reflected the intellectual freedom of Athens and the sacred mission of a doctor\n   * The opening of the University of Bologna in 1088, which was EuropeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first university and whose structure provided the blueprint for many modern universities\n   * The inspiration for DanteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Divine Comedy on May 1, 1283, when the Italian poet first laid eyes on his beloved Beatrice, the woman who would lead him to write one of the greatest poems in the history of Western literature\n   * The Battle of Vienna on September 12, 1683, which pitted the Ottoman Turks against the Holy Roman Empire and laid the groundwork for todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tensions between East and West\n\nWhether itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an obvious or not-so-obvious choice, Professor Fears takes great care to tie each event to the 21st century, pointing out just how influential these and other moments were in shaping who we are and how we live. As Professor Fears states at the start of his course, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe best reason for studying history is not the accumulation of facts. It is to use the lessons of the past to make decisions in the present and to look into the future.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nHistory Taught by a Master\n\nIf youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve taken a Great Course with Professor Fears before, then The World Was Never the Same is his most impressive course yetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the perfect way to reconnect with him and his unique perspective on the past.
