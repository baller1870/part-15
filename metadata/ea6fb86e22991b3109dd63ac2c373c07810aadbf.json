Robert       \n             Duval (Jacques Gamblin) is a taxi driver who is married      \n             to Marie-Jeanne (Zabou Breitman), who has shed the           \n             bohemian ways of her youth with the passage of time.         \n             Robert's father (Roger Dumas) has been generous enough       \n             to give his son the comfortable home he shares with          \n             Marie-Jeanne and their children, but that doesn't mean       \n             there's always a genuine respect between them. Robert        \n             and Marie-Jeanne have three children -- their eldest         \n             Albert (Pio Marmai) is struggling with the rigors of         \n             medical school when we first meet him, while Raphael         \n             (Marc-Andre Grondin) is a teen trying to decide what to      \n             do with his life and Fleur (Deborah Francois) is still       \n             learning to be comfortable with her femininity. Between      \n             1988 and 2000, the Duval family finds themselves dealing     \n             with the sort of life changes that affect most families,     \n             seeming both typical and revelatory at the same time.        \n                                                                          \n        Cast .......: Jacques Gamblin as Robert Duval                     \n                      Zabou Breitman as Marie-Jeanne Duval                \n                      Dborah Franois as Fleur Duval                     \n                      Marc-Andr Grondin as Raphal Duval                 \n                      Pio Marma as Albert Duval                          \n                      Roger Dumas as Pierre                               \n                      Ccile Cassel as Prune                              \n                      Stanley Weber as ric                               \n                      Sarah Cohen-Hadria as Clara                         \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                         \n                                                        \n                                                      \n                                                       \n                                          \n                  \n                        \n                           \n            \n                    \n                                               \n                                                          \n                                                             \n                                                             \n                                                                 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                               \n                                                  \n                          \n                              \n                             \n                  \n              \n                                             \n                                                    \n                                                         \n                                                 \n                                                                          \n                             RIPPER's NOTES                             \n                                                                      \n        Some previous FRENCH tagged releases around.                    \n                                                                        \n                                                                          \n                                                         \n                                                        \n                                                      \n                                                       \n                                          \n                  \n                        \n                           \n            \n                    \n                                               \n                                                          \n                                                             \n                                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                               \n                                                  \n                          \n                              \n                             \n                  \n              \n                                             \n                                                    \n                                                         \n                                                 \n                                                                          \n                                 WANTED                                 \n                                                                      \n                                                                        \n             We're currently looking for dedicated rippers.             \n              (.us, .de, .es, .fr, .it, .pl, .uk, .ru, ....)              \n                                                                          \n                               &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot;
