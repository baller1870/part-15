The 45 rpm speed was obtained by plugging in the turntable (and ONLY the turntable) into a PS Audio mains regenerator running at 81 Hz. The output from the Naim NAC552 preamp was sent into a Yamaha CD-recorder. \n\nAll electronics were fed pure balanced power by a 300 lb Equitech wall mounted mains transformer. \n\nThe bass here is DEEEEEEEEEEP and tuneful, typical of a well sorted out Linn Sondek, although having a dedicated Supercap on the Prefix was a big help. And yes, I did try powering the Prefix from one of the powered outputs of the 552 preamp-but it wasn't even close!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dd8ef35c1f5f2d2bb652dcbdb09916635ede1bd","amp;dn":"Sia-Breath+Me%2C+audiophile+vinyl+rip%2C+Linn+Naim+45+rpm+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dd8ef35c1f5f2d2bb652dcbdb09916635ede1bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,216,239,53,193,245,242,210,187,101,45,203,219,9,145,102,53,237,225,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
