Some of the recordings he made himself; others were taken from the archives of Radio Sofia.[2]\n\nIn the 1980s, Ivo Watts-Russell (founder of 4AD) was introduced to the choir from a third or fourth generation audio cassette lent to him by Peter Murphy, singer from the band Bauhaus. He became thoroughly entranced by the music, and tracked down and licensed the recordings from Cellier.[3] So in 1986, it was re-released on the 4AD label in the UK, in 1987 the Nonesuch label in the US and on the Philips label in other territories.\n\nSubsequent albums were released with similar titles: Le MystÃƒÂ¨re des Voix Bulgares, Volume 2 [1988], which won a Grammy Award in 1989;[4] Le MystÃƒÂ¨re des Voix Bulgares, Volume 3 [1990]; and Le MystÃƒÂ¨re des Voix Bulgares, Volume 4 [1998]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2c9a5e3ee296ee45eeeb8d2c10f9071c4d2c808","amp;dn":"Le+Myst%26egrave%3Bre+des+Voix+Bulgares","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2c9a5e3ee296ee45eeeb8d2c10f9071c4d2c808","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,201,165,227,238,41,110,228,94,238,184,210,193,15,144,113,196,210,200,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
