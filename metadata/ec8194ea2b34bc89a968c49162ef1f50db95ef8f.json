Our memory is unreliable; we can't multiply large sums in our heads; advertising manipulates our judgment; we tend to distrust people who are different from us; supernatural beliefs and superstitions are hard to shake; we prefer instant gratification to long-term gain; and what we presume to be rational decisions are often anything but. Drawing on striking examples and fascinating studies, neuroscientist Dean Buonomano illuminates the causes and consequences of these &quot;bugs&quot; in terms of the brain's innermost workings and their evolutionary purposes. He then goes one step further, examining how our brains function-and malfunction-in the digital, predator-free, information-saturated, special effects-addled world that we have built for ourselves. Along the way, Brain Bugs gives us the tools to hone our cognitive strengths while recognizing our inherent weaknesses.\n\nEnjoy and Seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec8194ea2b34bc89a968c49162ef1f50db95ef8f","amp;dn":"Brain+Bugs+by+Dean+Buonomano+audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec8194ea2b34bc89a968c49162ef1f50db95ef8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,129,148,234,43,52,188,137,169,104,196,145,98,239,31,80,219,149,239,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
