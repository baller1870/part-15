It presents a comprehensive overview of the late prehistoric cultures of these regions, which are of key importance for the understanding of long-term changes in Eurasia. At the crossroads of Europe and Asia, the Urals and Western Siberia are characterized by great environmental and cultural diversity which is reflected in the variety and richness of their archaeological sites. Based on the latest achievements of Russian archaeologists, this study demonstrates the temporal and geographical range of its subjects starting with a survey of the chronological sequence from the late fourth millennium BC to the early first millennium AD. Recent discoveries contribute to an understanding of issues such as the development of Eurasian metallurgy, technological and ritual innovations, pastoral nomadism and its role in Eurasian interactions, and major sociocultural fluctuations of the Bronze and Iron Ages.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9757c7984fc75841cb9b0f69969cef615ec1422f","amp;dn":"The+Urals+and+Western+Siberia+in+The+Bronze+and+Iron+Age+%28Histor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9757c7984fc75841cb9b0f69969cef615ec1422f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,87,199,152,79,199,88,65,203,155,15,105,150,156,239,97,94,193,66,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
