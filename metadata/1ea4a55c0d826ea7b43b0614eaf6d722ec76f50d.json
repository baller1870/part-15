Titled The\nSpeakeasy, the album is undoubtedly the band s pice de rsistance. Every\nElement of The Speakeasy suggests that Smoke Or Fire have finally realized\ntheir potential. The Speakeasy is a complete album in the truest sense,\nlacking nothing, while offering varied, yet equally enthralling melodies and\nmusic on each of the 13 tracks. Constructed around the cornerstone of the\nguitar driven, heavy punk sound they are known for, this album evolves much\nfurther. Innovative melodies are ushered along by clever guitar work as gruff\nvocals give way at times to a more polished pitch. Joe (singer/guitarist)\nfinds a way to throttle his vocals to the brink of what is humanly possible,\nyet still maintains the key, infusing a palatable passion into the music.\nFrom the jumpy cadence of 1968 , to the anthemic sound of Integrity to folk\nbased Honey I Was Right About the War , The Speakeasy maintains high energy\nthroughout, while displaying a range of songwriting mastery. Add to this the\nfact that Smoke Or Fire brought in a new rhythm section featuring Ryan\nParrish (Darkest Hour) on drums and Gwomper (Avail) on bass, along with\nenlisting the production talents of Matt Allison (Alkaline Trio, Lawrence\nArms), and it s not surprising that The Speakeasy turned out to be an album\nthat will dominate playlists for a long time to come.\n\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n1.
