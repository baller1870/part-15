It covers the period from the Varangian incursions through the reign of Peter the Great.\n\nI did find it very interesting and enjoyable, and surprisingly free from overt bias, given that it was written in the middle of Cold War I, and issued by an ultra-conservative publisher. Wallace appears to be fair-minded and resists demonizing his subject. Anyone seeking non - Russophobic context for current events will find this old but still relevant book surprisingly useful.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87479e0b00774e0167aaad441c160ef110e438cd","amp;dn":"Great+Ages+of+Man+-+Rise+of+Russia+%28History+Arts+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87479e0b00774e0167aaad441c160ef110e438cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,71,158,11,0,119,78,1,103,170,173,68,28,22,14,241,16,228,56,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
