Then you can retopologize your sculpt to produce a lighter model more suitable for complex scenes and animation. Your sculpted model becomes, in essence, a frame around which you can build a well-constructed polygon model.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨In this course, modeling expert Adam Trachtenberg shows viewers how to use the sculpting tools in C4D to create a hard surface model, retopologize the sculpted model, return to sculpting mode to add fine details, and generate texture maps that approximate the illusion of detailÃ¢â‚¬â€without the weight of polygons. He demonstrates the steps using a fantasy spaceship model, the kind you'd see in professional video games, television, or feature films. Watch and learn how to use these techniques to build your own.\nTopics include:\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tSketching the rough form\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tBuilding a simple polygon model\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tWorking with C4D's sculpting brushes and masks\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tRetopologizing the sculpted model\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tCreating bump, normal, and displacement maps to add fine detail\n\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0edd3973670fb8612a900fc89cf9275fb1f10c8","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Hard+Surface+Sculpting+and+Retopologizing+in+CINEMA+4D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0edd3973670fb8612a900fc89cf9275fb1f10c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,237,211,151,54,112,251,134,18,169,0,252,137,207,146,117,251,31,16,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
