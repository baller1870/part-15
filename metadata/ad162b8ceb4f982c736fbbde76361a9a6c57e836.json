There was originally supposed to be an issue five as well. It's listed all over the place as &quot;of 5&quot;, but I don't think issue five made it to print. I don't know if they wrapped up the story in issue four or not... because I don't have it! Grrrr!\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nCrawling Sky 1-3 (of 4, or 5 - issues four and five are not in this torrent)\n\nAntarctic Press, 2013, 27-28 pages each\n\nWritten by Joe R Lansdale, Keith Lansdale\n\nIllustrated by Brian Denham\n\nA tale o' terror set in the wild, weird West! When their dad accidentally commits murder, plug-ugly Norville and his sister Sissy have to flee with him to Texas to start a new life. Near the town of Wood Tick, they find a homestead, good as new, but abandoned. The only problem is the well, which is blocked by big, white stones. One by one, they unblock the well, unaware they're slowly setting free something old and dark and evil","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad162b8ceb4f982c736fbbde76361a9a6c57e836","amp;dn":"Joe+R.+Lansdale%2C+Keith+Lansdale+-+Crawling+Sky","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad162b8ceb4f982c736fbbde76361a9a6c57e836","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,22,43,140,235,79,152,44,115,111,187,222,118,54,26,154,108,87,232,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
