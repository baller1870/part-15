Some nations and peoples experience the fragmentation of once certain identities as threatening and likely to generate political and social breakdown. Others encounter globalization as a challenge which brings uncertainties but also opportunities for adaptation, the evolution of hybrid identities or new forms of protest.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e06cfd792f4a7e6951c6bfe15e1c405ac894f376","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2001%5D+Globalization+and+National+Identities+Crisis+or+Opp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e06cfd792f4a7e6951c6bfe15e1c405ac894f376","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,108,253,121,47,74,126,105,81,198,191,225,94,28,64,90,200,148,243,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
