In January 2007, President George W. Bush announced a new strategy for Iraq. It became known as &quot;the surge.&quot; Among those called to carry it out were the young, optimistic army infantry soldiers of the 2-16, the battalion nicknamed the Rangers. About to head to a vicious area of Baghdad, they decided the difference would be them. Fifteen months later, the soldiers returned home - forever changed. The chronicle of their tour is gripping, devastating, and deeply illuminating for anyone with an interest in human conflict.  With The Good Soldiers, Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter David Finkel has produced an eternal story - not just of the Iraq War, but of all wars, for all time. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Good-Soldiers-David-Finkel/dp/B004VD3QWQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Good-Soldiers-David-Finkel/dp/B004VD3QWQ&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Finkel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Finkel&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7ddb4baa5184a831b97a24879938b99c34dbc91","amp;dn":"David+Finkel+-+The+Good+Soldiers.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7ddb4baa5184a831b97a24879938b99c34dbc91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,221,180,186,165,24,74,131,27,151,162,72,121,147,139,153,195,77,188,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
