With his life now revolving around his wife Cai Bo who is obsessed with having children, the quirks of his eccentric family and his mediocre, ordinary existence, Xu Lai hopes to reconnect with his first love Yang YIi on an upcoming vacation. However, his hopes are dashed when he finds himself wrapped up in a murder investigation that proves truth is often stranger than fiction.\r\nXu Lai had dreams once. To be an artist and marry the girl of his dreams. 15 years later, he's sick of designing bras, humoring his baby-crazy wife, and catering to loopy in-laws. But his upcoming family vacation, now including his DVD-pirating, aspiring-documentarian brother-in-law, has a hidden agenda: a chance meetup with his old flame. But ditching his clan for a clandestine hookup might be the least of his worries. There's been a murder, and his new hot pursuit might be from the cops who want a word with him.\r\n\r\n53b1a87122294.png\r\n\r\nZheng Xu :... \r\nWei Zhao :... \r\n\r\n53b1a87034fbd.jpg\r\n\r\nVideo:-\r\n\r\nFormat : MP4 / x264 /   \r\nDuration : 01:53:47 \r\nBitrate : 2000 Kbps \r\nResolution = (Width/Height) : 1920x720 pixels \r\nFrame Rate : 24 fps\r\n\r\nAudio:-\r\n\r\nFormat : AAC\r\nBitrate : 96 Kbps\r\nChannels : 2 Channels\r\nSample Rate : 48 KHz\r\nLanguage : Chinese \r\n\r\nRelease info:-\r\n\r\nEncoded/Released By : Ozlem / ETRG\r\nTitle/Year : Lost in Hong Kong / 2015 \r\nFile Size : 1.62 GiB\r\nGenre : Comedy \r\nSource : Lost.in.Hong.Kong.2015.1080p.BluRay.x264-ROVERS (Thank You)\r\nSubtitles : English \r\nIMDB : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4242158/\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/a2PF \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/a2PH \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/a2Pk \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/a2Po \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/a2Pt \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/a2Px\r\n\r\nNote: This movie can be watched on TV,PC,tablets and phones with high quality.\r\n\r\nIf you have any problems with video/audio , Please update K Lite Mega Codec pack.\r\n\r\nTested on MPC,VLC,PS 3/4,PSP,XBOX 360,iTunes,ipad2,ipad mini,iphone 4/5S/6,Samsung Galaxy S5/S6,Samsung/LG/Vestel/SONY/Panasonic/Philips/Sharp/Toshiba/Beko/ArÃ§elik/Sunny Smart TV\r\n\r\nU can Follow Us on F a c e b o o k ==&gt; encoder ozlem\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease click on this link to reach all of ozlem encodes\r\n\r\nMake sure it is Genuine ETRG release @ ExtraTorrent.cc or from our Trusted Accounts elswhere","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb1f7498a9dec7da7edc0cde2e8eb5e48081d08f","amp;dn":"Lost.in.Hong.Kong.2015.1080p.BRRip.x264.Chinese.AAC-ETRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb1f7498a9dec7da7edc0cde2e8eb5e48081d08f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,31,116,152,169,222,199,218,126,220,12,222,46,142,181,228,128,129,208,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
