Molom apparently is a film that was released in a very limited fashion. I remember the day I saw this in the record store, and instantly snatched it up, thinking about the prospect of hearing McLaughlin incorporating yet another cultural tradition into his already astonishing repertoire, and wondering if he would pull it off as seamlessly as everything else. Well, unfortunately this was not to be, as the advertisement on the album cover is a bit misleading. The &amp;#039;traditional Mongolian Songs&amp;#039; are performed by other artists. Luckily, however, these are done quite well and act as poignant interludes. All this aside, McLaughlin contributes some delicate, ringing acoustic guitar backed by sparse keyboard accompaniment and tasteful percussive offerings from drum master Trilok Gurtu. Think along the lines of the track &quot;Amy and Joseph&quot; off of McLaughlin&amp;#039;s solo album The Promise, and you&amp;#039;ll have some sense of what this album is all about. Also, while I recognize this as a logical extension of it being a soundtrack, I still must marvel that McLaughlin hasn&amp;#039;t been as restrained as he is on here in years. A dearth of 32nd notes and wild arpeggio runs tell us this is someone who knows when to let loose and when to hold back, the mark of the wise musician. Molom is a beautiful album that can very much be enjoyed apart from its context as soundtrack work. While not a counter-pounding priority, it is strongly recommended if you can manage to locate it.\n\nreview by Joe McGlinchey\n\nFiles:\n\n01 Um Mani Padme Hum.flac\n02 Molom Theme Song 1.flac\n03 The Boy&amp;#039;s Theme 1.flac\n04 Breakfast - The Cave.flac\n05 The Four Seasons.flac\n06 Horses.flac\n07 Boudamchou.flac\n08 Little Girl&amp;#039;s Theme 1.flac\n09 Cows in the Water.flac\n10 The Man Hunts.flac\n11 The Camel Walk.flac\n12 Hunting - The Witch.flac\n13 The Boy Walks.flac\n14 Melody.flac\n15 The Dream of the Boy.flac\n16 The Boy Cries.flac\n17 Traditional Song.flac\n18 Introduction of the Boy to the Monk.flac\n19 The Little Girl Says Goodbye to the Boy.flac\n20 The Boy Leaves.flac\n21 National Song.flac\n22 Molom Theme Song End.flac\nJohn McLaughlin - 1995 - Molom - A Legend Of Mongolia.cue\nDescription.txt\nFront.jpg\nInlay.jpg\nBack.jpg\n\n\nTo check out all TQMP uploads:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/breezin/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/breezin/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/slavetothesound/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/slavetothesound/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/downup/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/downup/&lt;/a&gt;\nOr use the TQMP searchtag.\n\nPlease feel free to join TQMP!\nThe &quot;rules&quot; are simple: Rip your CD (no 1980&amp;#039;s cassettetapes or vinylrips please!) in lossless format (flac is preferable) AND include artwork.
