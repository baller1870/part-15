Employing a more down-home (thumb and finger picks) approach to the B.B. King single-string style of playing, King enjoyed success on a variety of different record labels. Furthermore, he was one of the first bluesmen to employ a racially integrated group on-stage behind him. Influenced by Eddie Taylor, Jimmy Rogers, and Robert Jr. Lockwood, King went on to influence the likes of Eric Clapton, Mick Taylor, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Lonnie Mack, among many others.\n\nTracklist:\n01 - You've Got To Love Her With A Feeling 03:14\n02 - Hideaway 02:36\n03 - Have You Ever Loved A Woman 03:06\n04 - Sen-Sa-Shun 02:54\n05 - Look Ma, I'm Cryin' 03:12\n06 - San-Ho-Zay 02:37\n07 - I'm Tore Down 02:39\n08 - Driving Sideways 02:48\n09 - Takin' Care Of Business 02:53\n10 - Someday After A While (You'll Be Sorry) 04:34\n11 - The Stumble 03:14\n12 - She Put The Whammy On Me 02:57\n13 - High Rise 02:42\n14 - The Welfare (Turns Its Back On You) 02:44\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41df743e70cf566233fa26deadd62c9b0ed960e6","amp;dn":"Freddy+King+Texas+Sensation%28blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41df743e70cf566233fa26deadd62c9b0ed960e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,223,116,62,112,207,86,98,51,250,38,222,173,214,44,155,14,217,96,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
