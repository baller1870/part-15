Real estate and renovation experts, Property Brothers Drew and Jonathan Scott, come to the rescue and help the couple find a budget-friendly dream home that can be renovated on time. With a budget that doesn't match the couple's expectations, Drew and Jonathan struggle to sell the potential of an extreme fixer-upper. A tough decision between two massive renovation projects has to be made and the couple finally pulls the trigger. The brothers now only have four weeks to completely transform the house as promised. Tensions arise when the renovation exposes major structural issues that threaten the couple's budget. Stressed to the max, Tina and James are forced to roll up and their sleeves to keep the rising costs down.\n\nIf you see &quot;Hector&quot; on the end of a file it means I capped it.\nEnjoy, Gaz/Hector :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3046aae371fdea353e27ba19f7250e3930f09357","amp;dn":"My.Dream.Home.s02e01.PDTV.x264.Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3046aae371fdea353e27ba19f7250e3930f09357","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,70,170,227,113,253,234,53,62,39,186,25,247,37,14,57,48,240,147,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
