The VOB file is extracted untouched from a DVD.\n\nThe Cars are an American rock band that emerged from the new wave scene in the late 1970s. The band originated in Boston, Massachusetts, with lead singer, rhythm guitarist and songwriter Ric Ocasek, lead singer and bassist Benjamin Orr, lead guitarist Elliot Easton, keyboardist Greg Hawkes and drummer David Robinson. They were signed to Elektra Records by George Daly, then A&amp;R head, in 1977.\n\nThe Cars were at the forefront in merging 1970s guitar-oriented rock with the new synth-oriented pop that was then becoming popular and which would flourish in the early 1980s. The Cars started fresh with their debut album The Cars which went on to go platinum in late 1978. The Cars' debut album was called a &quot;genuine rock masterpiece&quot; by Allmusic. The most successful and well known song from the album, &quot;Just What I Needed&quot;, started as a demo in 1977. The song was sent as a mix tape to a local DJ in the Boston area, who played the song in heavy rotation. This soon caught the attention of other DJs, which led to the signing of the band by Elektra Records in 1977.\n\nThe band spent the winter of 1976Ã¢â‚¬â€œ77 playing throughout New England, developing the songs that would become their debut album. They shortly thereafter caught the attention of Maxanne Sartori, a local DJ on the Boston radio station WBCN, who began playing their demo of &quot;Just What I Needed.&quot; By virtue of that airplay, the band was signed to Elektra Records. &quot;Just What I Needed&quot; would turn out to be the first single from the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album, The Cars, released in 1978 and reaching No. 18 on the Billboard 200. &quot;My Best Friend's Girl&quot; and &quot;Good Times Roll&quot; soon followed, charting on the Billboard Hot 100. The band commissioned famed Playboy artist Alberto Vargas to design the sexy illustration for the cover of their second album, Candy-O, released in 1979. Hits from that album included &quot;Let's Go&quot;, &quot;It's All I Can Do&quot; and &quot;Dangerous Type.&quot;\n\nFollowing their 1982 tour, the Cars took a short break and went to work on solo projects, with Ocasek and Hawkes both releasing debut albums (Beatitude and Niagara Falls, respectively).\n\nThe Cars re-united and released their most successful album, Heartbeat City, in 1984. The first single, &quot;You Might Think&quot;, helped The Cars win Video of the Year at the first MTV Video Music Awards. Other hit singles from the album included &quot;Magic&quot;, &quot;Hello Again&quot;, and &quot;Why CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t I Have You&quot;. Their most successful single, &quot;Drive&quot;, gained particular notability when it was used in a video of the Ethiopian famine prepared by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and introduced by David Bowie at the 1985 Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium in London[2] (The Cars themselves performed in the Philadelphia Live Aid concert). Actor/director Timothy Hutton directed the band's 1984 &quot;Drive&quot; music video.\n\nThe Cars have been an influence on many bands over the years, as evidenced by the list of varied artists that have covered their songs. These include Nirvana (band) (who covered &quot;My Best Friend's Girl&quot; at their last-ever live performance on March 1, 1994), Smashing Pumpkins (&quot;You're All I've Got Tonight&quot;), Melvins (&quot;Candy-O&quot;), Red House Painters (&quot;All Mixed Up&quot;), Alkaline Trio (&quot;Bye Bye Love&quot;), Ziggy Marley (&quot;Drive&quot;), Poison (American band) (&quot;Just What I Needed&quot;), Deftones (&quot;Drive&quot;), and Hayseed Dixie (&quot;My Best Friend's Girl&quot;), among others.\n\nIn 2010, the founding members of The Cars suggested a reunion when Ric Ocasek, Elliot Easton, Greg Hawkes and David Robinson placed a photo of the four members together in Millbrook Sound Studios, Millbrook, NY on their Facebook page.[8] On October 13, they also posted a snippet of a new song, &quot;Blue Tip&quot;, on their Facebook page. A picture of Jacknife Lee in the studio was posted on the group's Facebook page hinting that he would be producing the new Cars album.\n\nThe new album, titled Move Like This, was released on May 10 by Hear Music/Concord Music Group, debuting at No. 7 on Billboard's album charts. The album's first single, &quot;Sad Song&quot;, was released to radio stations March 1. In April 2011, The Cars announced a ten-city tour of the United States and Canada to start in May 2011.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\nSet List:\n\n1. Just What I Needed\n   Intro\n2.

Has to be one of their best live shows and they are one of my alltime favorate bands, there just isn't anything that comes close to their great sounding hits! :) \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6772dfd56242a85f86cbf94fd1ad4772647198c9","amp;dn":"The+Cars+-+Rock+Goes+to+College+%5BUniversity+of+Sussex%2C+1979%5D.VOB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6772dfd56242a85f86cbf94fd1ad4772647198c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,114,223,213,98,66,168,95,134,203,249,79,209,173,71,114,100,113,152,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
