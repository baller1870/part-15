It impacts the ways we work, relax, behave, and feel. It can make us smile or cry, it helps us bond with the people around us, and it even has the power to alleviate a range of medical conditions. The songs you love (and hate, and even the ones you feel pretty neutral about) don't just make up the soundtrack to your life--they actually help to shape it. \r\n\r\nIn WHY YOU LOVE MUSIC, scientist and musician John Powell dives deep into decades of psychological and sociological studies in order to answer the question &quot;Why does music affect us so profoundly?&quot; With his relaxed, conversational style, Powell explores all aspects of music psychology, from how music helps babies bond with their mothers to the ways in which music can change the taste of wine or persuade you to spend more in restaurants. \r\n\r\nWHY YOU LOVE MUSIC will open your eyes (and ears) to the astounding variety of ways that music impacts the human experience","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3296182259828eaf8fc3607c4c54706fb3ec92ab","amp;dn":"Why+You+Love+Music+-+From+Mozart+to+Metallica+%282016%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3296182259828eaf8fc3607c4c54706fb3ec92ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,150,24,34,89,130,142,175,143,195,96,124,76,84,112,111,179,236,146,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
