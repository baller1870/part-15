The Encyclopedia of Mathematics and Society presents some 490 articles showing the math behind our daily lives, explaining to students how and why math works, and allowing readers to better understand how disciplines such as algebra, geometry, calculus, and others affect what we do every day. This outstanding reference is appropriate for both high school and undergraduate programs, making the content readily accessible to public library patrons as well.\n\n\n\nHardcover: 1191 pages\nPublisher: Salem Press (October 15, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1587658445\nISBN-13: 978-1587658440","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a70c90623db1e60db87a5dd250787e55427585e9","amp;dn":"The+Encyclopedia+of+Mathematics+and+Society%283+Vols%29%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a70c90623db1e60db87a5dd250787e55427585e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,12,144,98,61,177,230,13,184,122,93,210,80,120,126,85,66,117,133,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
