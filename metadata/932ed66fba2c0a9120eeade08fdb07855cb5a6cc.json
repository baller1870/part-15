[Beneath the Veiled Embrace] is about EmilyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s siren-esque contribution [to the metal scene], never descending into a vacuous vocal master-class.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ - Metal Hammer\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“... a truly mesmerizing mix of thrash, power and ladylike class.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Terrorizer\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ With a powerful and dramatic live show, PYTHIA have already played with some impressive acts such as Arch Enemy, Scorpions, Ministry, Tarja Turunen, Fields Of The Nephelim and Threshold, at some of the UKs most prestigious venues, including ShepherdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bush Empire, The Forum and The Electric Ballroom.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ PYTHIA represented the female fronted metal community at one of the UKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest Metal festivals Bloodstock Open Air 09, headlining the new Sophie Lancaster stage. Bloodstock founder and promoter Paul Gregory said:\n\n&quot;Adding PYTHIA to the festival was a natural choice to represent the female Gothic community and the launch of the Sophie Lancaster Stage. This stage is in memory of a young girl whose life was needlessly\ncut short by intolerance and mindless brutality.
