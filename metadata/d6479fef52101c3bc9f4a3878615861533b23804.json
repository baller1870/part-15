Wodehouse story was lost for 99 years, now recently discovered. It has some classic &quot;Plum&quot; ingredients: an eccentric Earl, an irresponsible young man, a chorus girl, and of course a butler, not Jeeves (Wodehouse hadn't created him yet!) but the ancient 'Keeling', who has more worldly wisdom than anybody.\n\n\nUploader's note.\nI caught this recently on radio 4 and I believe it was only the 2nd time it's been broadcast.\nIt fills a 15 minute slot and I was a little reluctant to upload somthing so small but I'm sure there's a lot of Wodehouse fans out there that would like to hear it so here it is. It was part of a BBC radio 4 Lost and Found series which had 2 other stories / parts but this was the only Wodehouse story.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6479fef52101c3bc9f4a3878615861533b23804","amp;dn":"PG+Wodehouse+-+Providence+%26+The+Butler++%28BBC+2010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6479fef52101c3bc9f4a3878615861533b23804","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,71,159,239,82,16,28,59,201,244,163,135,134,21,134,21,51,178,56,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
