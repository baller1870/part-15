Over 15 years and five studio albums, the part Irish, part Scottish five piece have sketched heart-bruised ballads and arm-around-your-best-mate festival anthems, radio hits and moments of painful introspection.\n\nAll of these have been gathered together for Up To Now, a 30 track, double album of singles, cover versions, rarities, album tracks and a handful of new songs. From their formation in Scotland in 1994, the band's hard-earned rise has seen them become one of the world's biggest bands, culminating in them selling over 10 million copies of their last three albums!\n\nTracks:\n\n101  Chocolate\n102  Chasing Cars\n103  Crack The Shutters\n104  Set The Fire To The Third Bar [Ft.
