It was directed by Tom Gries and Monte Hellman. The song &quot;Greatest Love of All&quot;, later remade by Whitney Houston, was written for this film and sung by George Benson. The movie follows Ali's life from the 1960 Olympics to his regaining the heavyweight crown from George Foreman in their famous &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot; fight in 1974. The footage of the boxing matches themselves are largely the actual footage from the time involved.\n\nThe movie is based on a book written by Muhammad Ali, Herbert Muhammad and Richard Durham.\n\n\nIMBD: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076111/\n\n\nI am not used to upload with low quality but this is the best I could do.\n\nDecent Quality ....watchable considering I found it on youtube\n\nand recoded...it is not so easy to find considering also the age of the movie\n\nI hope you like it seed and enjoy it - Thanks to all\n\nIn case I will get the DVD I will upload the new one","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e76d70495314539e572609118bcd3903381a38e","amp;dn":"Muhammad+Ali+-+The+Greatest+1977+Movie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e76d70495314539e572609118bcd3903381a38e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,118,215,4,149,49,69,57,229,114,96,145,24,188,211,144,51,129,163,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
