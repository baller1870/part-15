Giving these ancestral accounts in their true, epic form, The Ãƒï¿½satrÃƒÂº Edda is designed as a religious work by and for the men and women of this path. In reconstructing this sacred epic, the idea is to create a living storytelling tradition that will honor the legacy of the ancient Teutonic peoples, while providing an in-depth source of Ãƒï¿½satrÃƒÂº wisdom for our modern world.\n\n---\n\nInformation:\nFormat: PDF\nPrint length: 424 pages (PDF version 417 pages, several blank pages removed)\nPublisher: iUniverse (April 24, 2009)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1440131783\nISBN-13: 978-1440131783\n\n---\n\nComment:\nFor a starter: I will not get into any sort of Ã¢â‚¬Å“There is no such thing as an Asatru BibleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ arguments, nor any kind of disputes regarding the validity of Viktor Rydberg's interpretation of the Eddas, which admittedly sometimes can be a bit free, to say the least. [DerHammer] releasing this document, doesn't mean we regard it as some sort of unquestionable authority.\nAnyhow, I regard the works of Rydberg to be highly valuable; especially for those of us who are Ã¢â‚¬Å“Edda nerdsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, that really like to dig into different translations and interpretations.\n\nThat being said, I'll just briefly tell you about this [DerHammer] edition of The Asatru Edda:\nIt's based on a PDF I found somewhere else, which was about 10 MB in size. I shrunk it to about 3,5 MB's, and still added the back cover just for good measure.\nMoreover Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and more importantly Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I applied the (up to that date) known errors in the text, as summed up in the study guide - which is available free for download directly from The Norroena Society. A few of the errors, I could not fix - as these had to do with the nature of the text itself. I felt it wasn't suitable for me to make such changes to a text not written by me.\nA complete TOC (PDF Ã¢â‚¬Å“BookmarksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) has been added to both files, except for the extensive (and in eReader rather pointless) Personal Synopsis. If you decide to print the Study Guide, you might have use for it Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and then you'll need no PDF Bookmarks anyway.\n\nFinally, both the documents have been margin cut to suit handheld devices better, and seems to work very well on any device capable of handling PDF files. I'd rather read it on a larger device, unless you fancy using landscape mode on a smaller smartphone.\n\nShare and seed until RagnarÃƒÂ¶k!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66a7800b5b73dd00df20b04053c0a5dd7c99b6be","amp;dn":"The+%26Aacute%3Bsatr%26uacute%3B+Edda%3A+Sacred+Lore+of+the+North+%2B+Study+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66a7800b5b73dd00df20b04053c0a5dd7c99b6be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,167,128,11,91,115,221,0,223,32,176,64,83,192,165,221,124,153,182,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
