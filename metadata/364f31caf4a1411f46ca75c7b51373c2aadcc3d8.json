ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not so much a guitar as a piece of two by four with a string nailed to it. He calls it his Diddley Bow, and the resultant groove is exactly that as laid down by the bloke who (almost) had that name, only in reverse.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Diddley Bo - 3:51\n2. Big Green And Yeller - 4:15\n3. Happy (To Have A Job) - 3:06\n4. The Banjo Song - 3:30\n5. Man From Another Time - 3:14\n6. That's All - 4:39\n7. Just Because I Can (CSX) - 3:40\n8. Never Go West - 3:30\n9. Dark - 3:55\n10. Wenatchee - 3:54\n11. My Home (Blue Eyes) - 2:29\n12. Seasick Boogie - 10:30\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:364f31caf4a1411f46ca75c7b51373c2aadcc3d8","amp;dn":"Seasick+Steve-+Man+From+Another+Time%28blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"364f31caf4a1411f46ca75c7b51373c2aadcc3d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,79,49,202,244,161,65,31,70,202,117,199,181,19,115,194,170,220,195,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
