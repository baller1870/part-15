Pretty good. Converted from PDF\n\nEPUB &amp; MOBI\n\n\n\nOne of the most powerful of the Seth Books, this essential guide to conscious living clearly and powerfully articulates the furthest reaches of human potential, and the concept that we all create our own reality according to our individual beliefs. Having withstood the test of time, it is still considered one of the most dynamic and brilliant maps of inner reality available today. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Seth books present an alternate map of reality with a new diagram of the psyche . . . useful to all explorers of consciousness.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ Deepak Chopra Ã¢â‚¬Å“Seth was one of my first metaphysical teachers. He remains a constant source of knowledge and inspiration in my life.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ Marianne Williamson Ã¢â‚¬Å“I would like to see the Seth books as required reading for anyone on their spiritual pathway. The amazing in-depth information in the Seth books is as relevant today as it was in the early Ã¢â‚¬â„¢70s when Jane Roberts first channeled this material.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ Louise Hay","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c144cae6e9edbc16f4aca128f63947f458b0634b","amp;dn":"Seth+Speaks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c144cae6e9edbc16f4aca128f63947f458b0634b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,68,202,230,233,237,188,22,244,172,161,40,246,57,71,244,88,176,99,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
