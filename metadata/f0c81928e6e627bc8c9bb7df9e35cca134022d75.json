Included among the classicpop hits are Eric Clapton's &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot;, Bruce Springsteen's &quot;Streets of Philadelphia&quot;, and Diana Ross's &quot;MissingYou&quot;, all touching, melancholy ballads which underscore thetragedy of Diana's death and the depth of the loss felt by those who mourn. Some of the songs written especially for the album include Peter Gabriel's spare &quot;In The Sun&quot;, Sinead O'Connor's soulful version of the hymn played at Diana's funeral, &quot;Make Me A Channel of Your Peace&quot;, and a moving remake of the Eurythmics' &quot;Angel&quot; by Annie Lennox. A moment of uplift is provided by the Pretenders' hopeful &quot;Hymn to Her:&quot; &quot;She will always carry on/Something is lost, but something is found/They will keep on speaking her name/Some things change,some stay the same&quot;.\n\n\n\nDisc 01\n\n[01] Who Wants To Live Forever\t\t- Queen\n[02] You Have Been Loved\t\t\t- George Michael\n[03] Angel\t\t\t\t- Annie Lennox\n[04] Make Me A Channel Of Your Peace\t\t- SinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ad O'Connor\n[05] Miss Sarajevo\t\t\t\t- Passengers Featuring Pavarotti\n[06] Shakespeare's Sonnet No. 18\t\t- Bryan Ferry\n[07] Little Willow\t\t\t\t- Paul McCartney\n[08] Tears In Heaven\t\t\t- Eric Clapton\n[09] Everybody Hurts\t\t\t- R.E.M.\n[10] Streets Of Philadelphia\t\t- Bruce Springsteen\n[11] Don't Dream It's Over\t\t\t- Neil Finn\n[12] Hymn To Her\t\t\t\t- The Pretenders\n[13] Love Minus Zero\t\t\t- Rod Stewart\n[14] In The Sun\t\t\t\t- Peter Gabriel\n[15] Watermark\t\t\t\t- Enya\n[16] Love Theme &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (Evergreen)\t- Barbra Streisand\n[17] Every Nation\t\t\t\t- Red Hot R&amp;B All Stars\n[18] I'll Fly Away\t\t\t\t- Aretha Franklin\n\n     Disc 01 - Play Time - 01h:16m:19s\n\n\n\nDisc 02\n\n[01] I'll Be Missing You\t\t\t- Puff Daddy Featuring Faith Evans[02] Because You Loved Me\t\t\t- Celine Dion\n[03] Gone Too Soon\t\t\t\t- Michael Jackson\n[04] You Were Loved\t\t\t- Whitney Houston\n[05] You Gotta Be\t\t\t\t- Des'ree\n[06] Hero \t\t\t\t- Mariah Carey [Live]\t\n[07] Prayer For The Dying\t\t\t- Seal\n[08] Missing You\t\t\t\t- Diana Ross\n[09] Wish You Were Here\t\t\t- Bee Gees\n[10] How Could An Angel Break My Heart\t- Toni Braxton\n[11] Love Is A Beautiful Thing\t\t- Tina Turner\n[12] All That Matters\t\t\t- Craig Richards\n[13] Mama\t\t\t\t\t- Spice Girls\n[14] Don't Wanna Lose You\t\t\t- Gloria Estefan\n[15] Stars\t\t\t\t- Simply Red\n[16] Ave Maria\t\t\t\t- Michael Bolton &amp; PlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡cido Domingo\n[17] Pavane\t\t\t\t- Lesley Garrett\n[18] I Am In Love With The World\t\t- Chicken Shed\n\n     Disc 02 - Play Time - 01h:16m:25s\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 02h:32m:47s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 361mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v8.2.1.6 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop R&amp;B Soul Easy Listening\n\nOriginally Released\t- 01 December 1997\n\nRecord Company\t\t- The Diana Princess Of Wales Memorial Fund - Sony Music\n \n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0c81928e6e627bc8c9bb7df9e35cca134022d75","amp;dn":"%5B1997%5D+Diana+Princess+Of+Wales+Tribute+-+Various+Artists+%40+320kb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0c81928e6e627bc8c9bb7df9e35cca134022d75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,200,25,40,230,230,39,188,140,155,183,223,158,53,204,161,52,2,45,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
