The process starts with roughing out a sketch of your character and building a profile that defines the person behind the drawing: who they are, where they come from, and how they got their powers. Then Ben shows how to incorporate those qualities in the character's facial features: eyes, nose, mouth, and distinguishing marks such as wrinkles, scars, and tattoos. Ben goes back and forth between good characters and evil ones, so members get a feel for what kinds of details give a sinister impression vs. a trustworthy one. He also shows how to use clothing and props to further tell the character's story. The work is completed in Adobe Photoshop, but everything Ben teaches is as relevant on paper as it is on screen.\r\nTopics include:\r\n\tâ€¢\tDrawing gesturally\r\n\tâ€¢\tChoosing your final lines\r\n\tâ€¢\tBuilding a character profile\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating the face\r\n\tâ€¢\tFine-tuning character details\r\n\tâ€¢\tDeveloping proper body proportions\r\n\tâ€¢\tExaggerating details to communicate personality\r\n\tâ€¢\tDressing the character\r\n\tâ€¢\tReferring back to your character profile\r\n\r\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f61abf6566f962b761836054493b4d6ce2d41283","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Drawing+Good+and+Evil+Comic+Book+Characters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f61abf6566f962b761836054493b4d6ce2d41283","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,26,191,101,102,249,98,183,97,131,96,84,73,59,77,108,226,212,18,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
