It survives in a single manuscript known as the Nowell Codex. Its composition by an anonymous Anglo-Saxon poet is dated between the 8th and the early 11th century. It fell into oblivion for many centuries, and its existence did not become widely known again until it was printed in 1815.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5998522918d2f447f56b7d8b4beea86b46e4cee7","amp;dn":"The+Epic+of+Beowulf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5998522918d2f447f56b7d8b4beea86b46e4cee7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,152,82,41,24,210,244,71,245,107,125,139,75,238,168,107,70,228,206,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
