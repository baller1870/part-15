Thanks for the memories Iron Mike. /akhiugo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad10a686a2da4ee6b4072c34184072824f156d5f","amp;dn":"Mike.Tyson.Raw.And.Uncut.Ep.11.DSR.XviD-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad10a686a2da4ee6b4072c34184072824f156d5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,16,166,134,162,218,78,230,180,7,44,52,24,64,114,130,79,21,109,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
