History comes alive in this fascinating story of opposing views that continue to play a fundamental role in today's politics and economics. In the twenty-first century, Adam Smith's 'invisible hand' model has gained the upper hand, and capitalism has ultimately won the ideological battle over socialism and interventionism. But even in the era of globalization and privatization, Keynesian and Marxist ideas continue to play a significant role in economic policy in the public and private sectors. \n\nAbout the Author\n\nMARK SKOUSEN has taught economics at Columbia University, is editor of Forecasts &amp; Strategies, a monthly investment newsletter, and is the author of more than twenty books, including The Making of Modern Economics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eccef5c064f1238476d858ce68af3f1f3dd1c88c","amp;dn":"The+Big+Three+in+Economics%3A+Adam+Smith%2C+Karl+Marx%2C+And+John+Mayn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eccef5c064f1238476d858ce68af3f1f3dd1c88c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,206,245,192,100,241,35,132,118,216,88,206,104,175,63,31,61,209,200,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
