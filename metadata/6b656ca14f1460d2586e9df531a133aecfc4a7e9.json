The humour sometimes descends into uninspiring childish toilet humour, and it&amp;#039;s not immune to getting laughs out of the mentally-challenged, but thanks to a priceless deadpan performance from David McPhail as the title character, this crude, dry and utterly hilarious take on New Zealand school life is wickedly un-PC comedy brilliance. We don&amp;#039;t get much New Zealand television here in Australia, but this one&amp;#039;s a gem. 8/10","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b656ca14f1460d2586e9df531a133aecfc4a7e9","amp;dn":"Seven+Periods+With+Mr+Gormsby","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b656ca14f1460d2586e9df531a133aecfc4a7e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,101,108,161,79,20,96,210,88,110,157,245,49,161,51,174,207,196,167,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
