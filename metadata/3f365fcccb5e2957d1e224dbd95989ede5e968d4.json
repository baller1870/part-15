Humanity is underpowered in the face of their onslaught, and people are suffering untold casualties trying to stem the flow. After barely surviving a super-powered bank heist gone horribly wrong, beat cop Leo Winters vowed to try and find a way to stop them. Following a lead, he discovered two lowlifes who seemed to be able to grant a person powers...for the right price. Thing is: you don't get to choose which power. It's seemingly random, a crap-shoot, a risk. Will Leo decide to take that risk? Why is it that even the heroes in this world eventually break?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f365fcccb5e2957d1e224dbd95989ede5e968d4","amp;dn":"Suicide+Risk+%28%23001-010%29+%7C+%28Mike+Carey%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f365fcccb5e2957d1e224dbd95989ede5e968d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,54,95,204,203,94,41,87,209,226,36,219,217,89,137,237,229,233,104,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
