Plantâ€™s voice definitely starts off sounding weak but he learns to control it as the show progresses and will use it to his advantage. Page sounds good in Over The Hills. His delicate intro is very nice and the solo, being more relaxed and experimental, pays off in this version. In My Time Of Dying gives Plant a bit of a break and he can get into the vocal comfortably without having to reach for the stratosphere. Someone misses a cue but they rectify the issue quickly and avoid any type of catastrophe. Jones sounds amazing under Pageâ€™s slide soloing. The Song Remains The Same continues with the band sounding very aggressive with Bonham at the forefront. Plant is careful with his voice by the end but The Rain Song will give him another break and is a nice contrast that follows. No Quarter is awesome, especially hearing it in this quality. Jones is obviously the star and his fingers sounds as â€œmysteriousâ€ as Robert describes him. Page creeps in for the solo and offers some nice fluidness in his playing, a really nice version that needs to be heard. The 32 minute Dazed And Confused contains the â€œStardustâ€ lyrics and is a good solid version of their experimental masterpiece. Plant even says â€œspeaking of journeys, that was some \r\njourneyâ€ after and talks about building up good vibes before a beautiful performance of Stairway To Heaven","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54b07486dd10d6b094bb3b5b7dc760e3d93b681b","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1975.03.03+Fort+Worth%2C+Texas+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54b07486dd10d6b094bb3b5b7dc760e3d93b681b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,176,116,134,221,16,214,176,148,187,59,91,125,199,96,227,217,59,104,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
