(Keep It Simple Stupid) Is part of a series of introductions to the world of homesteading (or smallholding) and self-sufficiency. And Ã¢â‚¬ËœQuick BitesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is all about putting essential information in such a way that it can be Ã¢â‚¬Ëœswallowed wholeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, and absorbed at one sitting Ã¢â‚¬â€œ so to speak.\nThere are many different aspects to homesteading, and food preserving is probably one of the most important. Whether or not you are fortunate enough to have a piece of land large enough to call a homestead, you can nevertheless have a need to preserve your own fruit or vegetables even if you are just running a raised bed garden.\nThis book is an outline only of the popular methods used to preserve food of all kinds, and truly is an introduction to the world of homesteading and food preserving in particular.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d43cfbb26590b6f302d07f278cebf8a8d42a84e","amp;dn":"K.I.S.S.+The+Homesteaders+%2F+Smallholders+%27Quick+Bites%27+Guidebook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d43cfbb26590b6f302d07f278cebf8a8d42a84e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,67,207,187,38,89,11,111,48,45,7,242,120,206,191,138,141,66,168,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
