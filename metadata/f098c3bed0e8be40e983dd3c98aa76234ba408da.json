Democracy Now!'s War and Peace Report provides the audience with access to people and perspectives rarely heard in the U.S.corporate-sponsored media, including independent and international journalists, ordinary people from around the world who are directly affected by U.S. foreign policy, grassroots leaders and peace activists, artists, academics and independent analysts. In addition, Democracy Now! hosts real debatesâ€“debates between people who substantially disagree, such as between the White House or the Pentagon spokespeople on the one hand, and grassroots activists on the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nDemocracy Now!\r\nThursday, June 02, 2016\r\n\r\nIraq War Veteran on Protesting Trump: We Do Not Want to Be Used as Props for Hate\r\n\r\n&quot;The System Is Set Up to Protect Officers&quot;: Activists React to Lack of Charges in Jamar Clark Case\r\n\r\nBlack Lives Matter Activist Convicted of Felony Lynching: &quot;Itâ€™s More Than Ironic, Itâ€™s Disgusting&quot;\r\n\r\nAfricaâ€™s Last Colony: Western Saharan Independence Movement Mourns Loss of Polisario Front Leader\r\n\r\nSupport independent news! \nhttp://www.democracynow.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f098c3bed0e8be40e983dd3c98aa76234ba408da","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now%21+2016-06-02+-+Trump+%2B+Veterans+%2B+BlackLivesMatter%2B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f098c3bed0e8be40e983dd3c98aa76234ba408da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,152,195,190,208,232,190,64,233,131,221,60,152,170,118,35,75,164,8,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
