This book explains the fundamental differences between the computational model assumed for algorithms and the real architectures in which programs execute. It highlights the pitfalls that can occur when implementing an algorithm as software and offers suggestions to solve these problems. The book also explores the interactions among program, compiler, and run-time support system, contrasting this with the simpler model assumed for algorithms. Intended for software developers and programmers, it places particular emphasis on the implications of the memory hierarchy on program efficiency.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bc915c5ea8d59da257e305cdf52e2a5cb522cf3","amp;dn":"A+Programmer%5C%27s+Companion+to+Algorithm+Analysis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bc915c5ea8d59da257e305cdf52e2a5cb522cf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,201,21,197,234,141,89,218,37,126,48,92,223,82,226,165,203,82,44,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
