Now the real part is that, I found a simple way of creating the qemu virtual computer, and you can do so easily on windows.\n\nYou need windows OS (I tested on Vista, and Xp, not other OS), a decent processor that does not get overloaded with another computer running on it as parasite, and some decent amount of RAM (allot 128 mb to XP and it will run as smooth as butter).\n\nRegards,\nnkarno","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ce550a35a291372711834b5856308cab60b5a45","amp;dn":"QEMU+0.9.0+With+Tutorial+-+Create+a+Virtual+Computer+easily","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ce550a35a291372711834b5856308cab60b5a45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,229,80,163,90,41,19,114,113,24,52,181,133,99,8,202,182,11,90,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
