Some later issues have also been uploaded but you'd do best to stick with these ones; at a certain point the X-Men title began reading too much like a soap opera...\n\nAnyway, use YACReader to open these because it's awesome. \nDo consider seeding...:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ba35a0f07106a47a5d942f896b2ad0f41b64921","amp;dn":"Uncanny+X-Men+by+Chris+Claremont+%28Minutemen-Syl3ntBob%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ba35a0f07106a47a5d942f896b2ad0f41b64921","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,163,90,15,7,16,106,71,165,217,66,248,150,178,173,15,65,182,73,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
