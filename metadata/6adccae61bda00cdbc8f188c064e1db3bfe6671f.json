Host Alison Sweeney explains that the ranch contestants will be safe this week if they collectively lose more than 48 pounds, but for the &quot;unknowns,&quot; they will be facing their first elimination all season. And both teams only get to see their trainers once this week. The &quot;unknowns&quot; experience some surprises while settling into their new home, and a secret is revealed about how one contestant has lost so much weight. A challenge involving weights shows which team stacks up to be the best, and later, everyone weighs in and finds out whether one or two players will be going home.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6adccae61bda00cdbc8f188c064e1db3bfe6671f","amp;dn":"The.Biggest.Loser.S11E05.HDTV.XviD-LW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6adccae61bda00cdbc8f188c064e1db3bfe6671f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,220,202,230,27,218,0,205,188,143,24,140,6,78,29,179,191,230,103,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
