The approach taken is genuinely cross-disciplinary in scope, and provides a fascinating account of the effects of sexual selection upon human evolution in the light of the latest advances in the field.\n\n===================================================================================\nReview\nProvides an invaluable analysis of cross-species research. Primate Eye this data-rich book, which takes a unique approach to heavily trodden subjects, should be recommended reading for all those interested in an evidence-basedapproach to the study of the evolutionary origins of human sexuality.

Forrester, Archives of Sexual Behavior\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nAlan Dixson was educated in England at the University of Nottingham, where he obtained a BSc in Zoology (1970) and at the University of Birmingham Medical School, where he was awarded a PhD (1973) and a DSc in Biological Sciences (1993). His research has involved comparative studies of reproductive biology and the evolution of sexuality in primates and in other mammals. He has held posts at the Zoological Society of London (1976-1983), Medical Research Council UK (1983-1999), International Medical Research Centre in Gabon (1989-1992), Sub-Department of Animal Behaviour, University of Cambridge (1993-1998) and was Director of Conservation and Science at the Zoological Society of San Diego in the USA (1999- 2005). He is currently a professor in the School of Biological Sciences at Victoria University of Wellington, in New Zealand. Alan Dixson has authored, or co-authored, more than 140 papers and books.\n\n===================================================================================\nBooks by the Same Author:\nPrimate Sexuality\nPaternity in Primates: Tests and Theories\nNatural History of the Gorilla\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67a4bba0020b10b099067ef43387b28c9c1149ac","amp;dn":"Alan+F.+Dixson+-+Sexual+Selection+and+the+Origins+of+Human+Matin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67a4bba0020b10b099067ef43387b28c9c1149ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,164,187,160,2,11,16,176,153,6,126,244,51,135,178,140,156,17,73,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
