To be sure, her success was as much due to marketing a niche \naudience in later years equally in love with Yanni and Michael Flatley's Irish \ndancing, but Enya's rarely given a sense of pandering in her work. She does \nwhat she does, just as she did before her fame. Admittedly, avoiding \noverblown concerts run constantly on PBS hasn't hurt. Indeed, the subtlety \nthat characterizes her work at her best dominates Watermark, with the lovely \ntitle track, her multi-tracked voice gently swooping among the lead piano, and \nstrings like a softly haunting ghost, as fine an example as any. &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot; \nitself, for all its implicit dramatics, gently charges instead of piling things on, \nwhile the organ-led &quot;On Your Shore&quot; feels like a hushed church piece. \nElsewhere, meanwhile, Enya lets in a darkness not overly present on The \nCelts, resulting in work even more appropriate for a moody soundtrack than \nthat album. &quot;Cursum Perficio,&quot; with her steady chanting-via-overdub of the \ntitle phrase, gets more sweeping and passionate as the song progresses, \nmatched in slightly calmer results with the equally compelling &quot;The Longships.&quot; \n&quot;Storms in Africa,&quot; meanwhile, uses drums from Chris Hughes to add to the \nunderstated, evocative fire of the song, which certainly lives up to its name. \nWatermark ends with a fascinating piece, &quot;Na Laetha Geal M'Oige,&quot; where \nfellow Irish modern/traditional fusion artist Davy Spillane adds a gripping, \nheartbreaking uilleann pipe solo to the otherwise calm synth-based \nperformance. It's a perfect combination of timelessness and technology, an \nappropriate end to this fine album.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n:: Generated by Music NFO Builder v1.21a - www.nfobuilder.com ::\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c76499bf05df4dadb8f70bbc07ed0df57dfede45","amp;dn":"Enya+-+Watermark+%281988%29+%5Bflac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c76499bf05df4dadb8f70bbc07ed0df57dfede45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,100,153,191,5,223,77,173,184,247,11,188,7,237,13,245,125,254,222,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
