It is also AC/DC's fourth international studio album. All songs were written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young and Bon Scott.\n\nIt was originally released on Atlantic Records, and reached #133 on Billboard's Pop Albums chart in the US, eventually going platinum there. Powerage was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC remasters series.\n\nEuropean LP release\n\nAll songs written and composed by Angus Young, Malcolm Young and Bon Scott. \n\nNo. \tTitle \tLength\n\n1. \t&quot;Rock 'n' Roll Damnation&quot;   \t3:06\n2. \t&quot;Gimme a Bullet&quot;   \t3:20\n3. \t&quot;Down Payment Blues&quot;   \t5:40\n4. \t&quot;Gone Shootin'&quot;   \t5:22\n5. \t&quot;Riff Raff&quot;   \t5:14\n6. \t&quot;Sin City&quot;   \t4:45\n7. \t&quot;Up to My Neck in You&quot;   \t4:12\n8. \t&quot;What's Next to the Moon&quot;   \t3:42\n9. \t&quot;Cold Hearted Man&quot;   \t3:32\n10. \t&quot;Kicked in the Teeth&quot;   \t3:58\n\n    Initial editions of the European (UK) LP release featured a different mix of the album. It had a 'harder' sound than the later version, with small variations in vocals, guitar tracks, or both, and occasionally extra sections and longer or shorter fades. Some versions omitted &quot;Rock 'n' Roll Damnation&quot; from the track-list, but all included &quot;Cold Hearted Man&quot;, albeit in a different sequence than on subsequent pressings. One of the most marked differences is the exclusion of the bluesy coda on &quot;Down Payment Blues&quot;. The first cassette issue of the album also features this mix.\n\n    The album was later remixed for the American market, with the new mix replacing the original European mix, and becoming the global standard. This mix is still used on all AC/DC Powerage CD releases today.\n\n\nNOTE:\n\nExtension File Format: mp3\n\nBitrate: 128 kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7537735e0edcb10d55486da30825f03ae51bd27c","amp;dn":"AC%2FDC.Powerage.1978.Album.European.Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7537735e0edcb10d55486da30825f03ae51bd27c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,55,115,94,14,220,177,13,85,72,109,163,8,37,240,58,229,27,210,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
