With its combination of neurology, biology, and psychology, this course will help you understand how we perceive the world through our senses, how we move, how we learn and remember, and how emotions affect our thoughts and actions.\n\nThe ability to write, read, and perform music requires the coordinated activity of the sensory, motor, language, and limbic systems of the brain. Studies of musicians who have suffered strokes have identified specific brain areas involved in both the composition and appreciation of different features of music, such as rhythm.\n\n\nCheck this account for updates regularly :)\n\nThanks to the peers all over the globe seeding in this collection.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0f443395c06371ded18f9f27b1545801176ad1f","amp;dn":"Musical+Brains+Collection++-+Understanding+the+Brain+-+Music+and","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0f443395c06371ded18f9f27b1545801176ad1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,244,67,57,92,6,55,29,237,24,249,242,123,21,69,128,17,118,173,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
