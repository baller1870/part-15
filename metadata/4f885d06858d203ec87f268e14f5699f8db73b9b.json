Several of the songs from the album had been concert staples since 1977 but were omitted from the first album by choice of the producer, Chris Blackwell. More emphasis was put on production for Wild Planet. It was fairly well received by critics, most of whom regarded it as a strong second album following the success of their first. Wild Planet was quickly certified gold.\n\nDirector Gus Van Sant thanks the band in the credits of the 1991 film My Own Private Idaho for the use of the song title, &quot;Private Idaho.&quot; The song itself is not referred to anywhere in the movie.\n\n\nThe B-52s (styled as The B-52's prior to 2008) are an American new wave band, formed in Athens, Georgia in 1976. The original line-up consisted of Fred Schneider (vocals, percussion, keyboards), Kate Pierson (organ, bass, vocals), Cindy Wilson (vocals, bongos, tambourine, guitar), Ricky Wilson (guitars), and Keith Strickland (drums, guitars, synthesizers, various instruments). Following Ricky Wilson's death in 1985 Strickland switched full-time to guitar. The band subsequently added various musicians for their live shows. This included Sara Lee or Tracy Wormworth on (bass), Zachary Alford or Sterling Campbell on (drums, percussion) and Pat Irwin or Paul Gordon (keyboards &amp; guitars).\n\nRooted in new wave and 1960s rock and roll, the group later covered many genres ranging from post-punk to pop rock. The &quot;guy vs. gals&quot; vocals of Schneider, Pierson, and Wilson, sometimes used in call and response style (&quot;Strobe Light,&quot; &quot;Private Idaho&quot;, and &quot;Good Stuff&quot;), are a trademark. \n(video has a semi-transparent white &quot;zdf.kultur&quot; logo at the top left)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Planet&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Planet&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/caamNAaGd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/caamNAaGd&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 8516kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps\n   Duration: 00:02:59\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
