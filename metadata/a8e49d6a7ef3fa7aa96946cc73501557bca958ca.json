Set in the early 1950s, in an India newly independent and struggling through a time of crisis, A Suitable Boy takes us into the richly imagined world of four large extended families and spins a compulsively readable tale of their lives and loves. A sweeping panoramic portrait of a complex, multi ethnic society in flux, A Suitable Boy remains the story of ordinary people caught up in a web of love and ambition, humor and sadness, prejudice and reconciliation, the most delicate social etiquette and the most appalling violence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8e49d6a7ef3fa7aa96946cc73501557bca958ca","amp;dn":"A+Suitable+Boy+-+Vikram+Seth.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8e49d6a7ef3fa7aa96946cc73501557bca958ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,228,157,106,126,243,250,122,169,105,70,204,115,80,21,87,188,169,88,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
