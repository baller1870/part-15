Patil et al. (WSP, 2008).pdf\r\n\r\nThe term, &quot;Nanotechnology&quot; was coined by a Japanese engineer, Nario Taniguchi in 1974. Eric Drexler in his book &quot;Engines of Creations&quot; published in 1986 envisaged the building of molecular machines by bringing atom by atom in a precise manner to make many simple desired systems. However, Drexler's dream continues to be implausible since the laws of chemistry do not easily allow this kind of assembly at the molecular level. The challenge facing nanotechnologists today is in designing fine grained structures, unlike biomolecular structures. A bigger confrontation is to merge the science intensive process with its engineering aspect. In this context the present book on Chemistry of Nanocrystalline Oxide Materials is a step closer to this challenge. It serves as a reference manual/monograph for the preparation of all types of oxides and is expected to be useful to students and researchers of nanomaterials alike. It also provides industrial units a unique opportunity to upscale this process into technology and exploit its myriad potential applications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04842acf0105ae3dfea152d9094766cb34244442","amp;dn":"Chemistry+of+Nanocrystalline+Oxide+Materials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04842acf0105ae3dfea152d9094766cb34244442","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,132,42,207,1,5,174,61,254,161,82,217,9,71,102,203,52,36,68,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
