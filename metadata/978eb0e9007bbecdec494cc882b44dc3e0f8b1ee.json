Thanks To Original Uploader For The Share. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ian Anderson Paice (born 29 June 1948) is an English musician, best known as the drummer of the English Rock band Deep Purple. As of Jon Lord's departure in 2002, he is the only continuous member of the band, and as such is the only member to appear on every album the band has released.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFrom Amazon:\n\nThe show couldn't have been more powerful, thanks to the contribution of Mark King of Level 42, delivering groovy renditions of two of his greatest hits with a legend of the Hammond organ: Brian Auger, who also plays on almost the whole show; Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson, lending his explosive voice for Thin Lizzy's 'Emerald' and The Who's 'Behind Blue Eyes', Alice Cooper playing with Ian Paice and Brian May his classics 'Elected' and 'School's Out', or Bruce Dickinson, Brian May, John Paul Jones and Ian Paice teaming up for a rendition of Deep Purple's 'Black Night'. British Blues Rockers The Temperance Movement, now a respected reality of UK rock music, made their debut in front of a large audience, while Steve Balsamo paid tribute to Jon Lord with 'Pictured Within', anticipating the great homage the Sunflower Jam would dedicate to Lord two years later with 'Celebrating Jon Lord' (Nr.1 in the DVD/Blu-Ray Charts in five European territories). \n\nJust when the Royal Albert Hall audience thought it simply couldn't get any better, the final 'Smoke on The Water' literally caused an explosion of joy and celebration - A feeling that is present on each song of this exciting recording. While the CD features 14 exciting live tracks, the DVD additionally to the full show contains further bonus tracks by Brian May &amp; Kerry Ellis, The Temperance Movement and Alfie Boe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:978eb0e9007bbecdec494cc882b44dc3e0f8b1ee","amp;dn":"VA%2FIan+Paice%27s+Sunflower+Superjam-Royal+Albert+Hall%5B2015%5D%5B320K%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"978eb0e9007bbecdec494cc882b44dc3e0f8b1ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,142,176,233,0,123,190,205,236,73,76,200,130,180,77,195,224,248,177,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
