It's an edge-of-the-seater all the way.\n\nLorre is Leyden, a Dutch mystery writer vacationing in Istanbul. At a party he meets one of his most ardent fans, Col. Haki (Katch), head of the secret police, who tells him that the body of arch criminal Dimitrios Makropoulous (Scott), has washed up on the nearby beach, murdered, stabbed to death. What fascinates Leyden is Haki's obsession with Makropoulos, a man who practiced &quot;murder, treason, and betrayal&quot; as a way of life. \n\nAfter a visit to the morgue to view the body, Leyden decides to write a novel about the sinister man and begins to delve into his past. What he encounters is a heady, complexly plotted brew of blackmail, seduction, spy intrigues, assassination and suicide.\n\nThe best of the Peter Lorre-Sydney Greenstreet pairings.\n\nSydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre make a marvelous team in this exhilarating and atmospheric film noir that Daily Variety hailed as Ã¢â‚¬Å“one of the most brilliant crime dramas yet filmed.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ When the body of Dimitrios Makropoulos (Zachary Scott) washes ashore in Istanbul, there is cause for celebration all across Europe. The devious sociopath has left as his legacy an array of crimes including blackmail, thievery, murder and high treason. Interested in chronicling the dead man's unscrupulous exploits, mystery writer Cornelius Leyden (Lorre) takes up his trail, aided by a mysterious man named Peters (Greenstreet). But as Leyden zeroes in on the truth about Dimitrios, he finds that his new associate has an ulterior motive in helping him Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with Leyden as the unwitting accomplice! As suspenseful and riveting as the Eric Ambler novel on which it is based, The Mask of Dimitrios is Ã¢â‚¬Å“an exceptional pictureÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Los Angeles Times) that delivers nonstop, pulse-quickening excitement!\n\nThe Mask of Dimitrios has another mark in its favor when it skips a Hollywood-style ending in favor of a finish more like a class-act mystery story. It's a treat to follow the adventures of Cornelius Leyden, who will indeed have a great story to write.\n\nWarner Bros. could crank out smashing suspense films like this one on a regular basis during the 1940s. \n\nBased on the true story of billionaire munitions king Basil Zaharoff.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 01.38gb\nDuration.... 01:35:39\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width..... 720\nFrame Height.... 540\nData Rate.... 1945kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23 F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 128kbps\n1 Channel mono\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48 KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c56cccc61dae4402c6899ddf307e2d6eb035267a","amp;dn":"The+Mask+of+Dimitrios+1944+DvdRip+Avi+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c56cccc61dae4402c6899ddf307e2d6eb035267a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,108,204,198,29,174,68,2,198,137,157,223,48,126,45,110,176,53,38,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
