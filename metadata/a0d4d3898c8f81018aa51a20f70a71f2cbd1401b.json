Contains ISO without crack, just keep mounted to play. Requires Quicktime 6 (included) for videos.\n\nWorks for me on 64-bit Windows 7. I installed and ran it in Windows XP (sp2) compatibility mode. I'm not sure if that's necessary, but it's what I did =P\n\n\nPC ISO - no crack, keep mounted to play\n\ndumped by al1o","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0d4d3898c8f81018aa51a20f70a71f2cbd1401b","amp;dn":"Fairly+OddParents+-+Breakin+Da+Rules+-+PC+-+al1o","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0d4d3898c8f81018aa51a20f70a71f2cbd1401b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,212,211,137,140,143,129,1,138,165,26,32,247,10,113,242,203,209,64,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
