Hendrix was a master at coaxing all manner of unforeseen sonics from his instrument, often with innovative amplification experiments that produced astral-quality feedback and roaring distortion. His frequent hurricane blasts of noise and dazzling showmanship -- he could and would play behind his back and with his teeth and set his guitar on fire -- has sometimes obscured his considerable gifts as a songwriter, singer, and master of a gamut of blues, R&amp;B, and rock styles.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tStar Mark\nCatalog:\t\t24328-1/2\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.75% CDDA &amp; 99.94% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n01.Purple Haze\n02.Hey Joe\n03.Crosstown Traffic\n04.The Wind Cries Mary\n05.Fire\n06.Highway Chile\n07.Little Wing\n08.All Along The Watchtower\n09.Manic Depression\n10.Foxy Lady\n11.Spanish Castle Magic\n12.Burning Of The Midnight Lamp\n13.Castles Made Of Sand\n14.51st Anniversary\n15.Can You See Me\n16.May This Be Love\n17.Come On (Let The Good Times Roll)\n18.Ain't No Telling\n19.Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\n20.I Don't Live Today\n21.Red House\n22.Up From The Skies\n23.Wait Until Tomorrow\n24.Rainy Day, Dream Away\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n\n\n01.Stone Free\n02.Freedom\n03.Valleys Of Neptune\n04.Angel\n05.Night Bird Flying\n06.Stepping Stone\n07.Dolly Dagger\n08.Drifting\n09.Room Full Of Mirrors\n10.Bleeding Heart\n11.Ezy Ryder\n12.Lover Man\n13.My Friend\n14.Astro Man\n15.Message To Love\n16.Izabella\n17.Hear My Train A Comin'\n18.Wild Thing (Live)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0f3810be34e6f5807550a7be33f02148ecb31aa","amp;dn":"Jimi+Hendrix+-+Greatest+Hits+2CD+%282010%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0f3810be34e6f5807550a7be33f02148ecb31aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,243,129,11,227,78,111,88,7,85,10,123,227,63,2,20,142,203,49,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
