It is the first part of the Calcutta trilogy. Set during the period of the naxalite movement in Bengal, Pratidwandi tells the story of Siddharta, an educated middle-class man caught within the turmoils of social unrest. Corruption and unemployment is rampant, and Siddhartha cannot align himself with either his revolutionary activist brother, or career-oriented sister.\n\nThe film is stylistically unusual for Ray, featuring techniques inspired by the French New Wave, such as jump-cuts, edgy framing, dream sequences, and sexual metaphors. Some of the experimental techniques which the film pioneered include photo-negative flashbacks and X-ray digressions.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/3438248x.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/3438248x.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage : Bengali\nSubtitles : English (.srt)\n\nIMDB  \n7.6/10   195 votes &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066237/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066237/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nREVIEW\nRay's forgotten masterpiece, 16 April 2005 \nAuthor: BoFi from India \nIt is my personal view, and I think I'll have to go into hiding after saying this, that this is Satyajit Ray's greatest film. I happen to share a common name with the protagonist, Siddhartha, and knowing the sort of impact this movie had on my father, and people of his generation, I wouldn't be surprised if, subconsciously at least, I was named after the character.\nThis movie is the first in what is called Ray's 'Calcutta Trilogy', which consists of 'Pratidwandi', 'Seemabaddha', and 'Jana Aranya'. These three movies, though not as remarkable perhaps as his previous, and more famous trilogy, the 'Apu trilogy', are nonetheless some of his finest and most subtle movies.\nPratidwandi is set in a Calcutta rocked by political unrest, and examines the varied reactions of the youth of the city to this unrest. Based on Sunil Gangopadhyay's novel, the story revolves around Siddhartha, his family, the girl he loves and his struggle for survival in the big city, while at all times staying true to his principles. From its beginning interview scene, its use of real events as backdrop, its sublime acting, particularly that of Dhritiman, right till its remarkable ending, arguably Ray's greatest ever, the film sustains a continues high which makes watching it an unforgettable experience.\n\nTECH SPECS\nVIDEO\n\nCD1\nCodec--XVID\nLength--49:37.075\nResolution--640 x 480\nDar--1.333 (4:3)\nFPS--23.976\nBitrate--1837\nQF--0.249\nCD2\nCodec--XVID\nLength--55:51.321\nResolution--640 x 480\nDar--1.333 (4:3)\nFPS--23.976\nBitrate--1616\nQF--0.219\n\nAUDIO\n0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3 48000Hz  122 kb/s tot , Joint Stereo\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2010-01-04-19h33m32s64.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2010-01-04-19h33m32s64.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2010-01-04-19h35m00s62.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2010-01-04-19h35m00s62.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2010-01-04-19h35m45s238.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2010-01-04-19h35m45s238.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2010-01-04-19h37m54s7.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2010-01-04-19h37m54s7.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
