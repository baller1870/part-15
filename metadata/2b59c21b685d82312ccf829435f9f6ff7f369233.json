Consequently, the safety of imported products has been pushed to the top of the agenda for companies, consumers, and governments.\n\nIt has often been argued that recalls occur due to differences among national standards, cost pressures and opportunistic behavior by companies. However, analysis of US toy recalls over a 20 year period reveals that the key to decreasing recalls and harm from defective products lies in improving product designs, learning from recalls and swiftly acting on incidents. Together, these point to the inherent dangers in the disaggregation of value chain and the need to effectively manage those dangers.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b59c21b685d82312ccf829435f9f6ff7f369233","amp;dn":"Not+Just+China%3A+The+Rise+of+Recalls+in+the+Age+of+Global+Busines","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b59c21b685d82312ccf829435f9f6ff7f369233","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,89,194,27,104,93,130,49,44,207,130,148,53,249,246,255,127,54,146,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
