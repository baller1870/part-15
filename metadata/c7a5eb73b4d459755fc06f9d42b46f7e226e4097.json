Hayes. Contemporary Books, September 1984.\n\n&quot;Wisdom from the Ninja Village of the Cold Moon is an imaginative rendering of what could have been part of a scroll inspired by the epic saga of the Togakure ninja family.&quot;\n\nThis was hand-scanned into a PDF. The original is black and white except for red bars on the cover. Not every page is 100% perfectly aligned but since this has never been released in an electronic format and is getting rare (new copies go for over $100), I thought I would contribute an electronic version as best I can.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7a5eb73b4d459755fc06f9d42b46f7e226e4097","amp;dn":"Wisdom+from+the+Ninja+Village+of+the+Cold+Moon+by+Stephen+K+Haye","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7a5eb73b4d459755fc06f9d42b46f7e226e4097","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,165,235,115,180,212,89,117,95,192,111,157,66,180,111,126,34,110,64,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
