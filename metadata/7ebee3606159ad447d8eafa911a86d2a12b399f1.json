Yet while our understanding of the Holocaust is well developed, we know little about everyday life in Nazi Germany.\n\nIn this vivid and important study Roger Moorhouse portrays the German experience of the Second World War, not through an examination of grand politics, but from the viewpoint of the capital's streets and homes.He gives a flavour of life in the capital, raises issues of consent and dissent, morality and authority and, above all, charts the violent humbling of a once-proud metropolis.\n\nShortlisted for the Hessell-Tiltman History Prize.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ebee3606159ad447d8eafa911a86d2a12b399f1","amp;dn":"Berlin+at+War+-+Life+and+Death+in+Hitler%27s+Capital%2C+1939-45","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ebee3606159ad447d8eafa911a86d2a12b399f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,190,227,96,97,89,173,68,125,142,175,169,17,168,109,42,18,179,153,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
