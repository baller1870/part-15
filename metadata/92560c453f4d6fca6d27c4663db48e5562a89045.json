Taking his first vocal bows behind the microphone is a big step for someone who usually lets his fingers do the talking, but Campbell's vocal delivery is surprisingly inoffensive, especially in comparison to some axe slingers who think they have vocal cords. On this 12-song session of gritty, no-frills blues-rock, Campbell pays homage to blues gods like Willie Dixon and Robert Johnson alongside latter-day geniuses like Rory Gallagher. Fans of Campbell's shredding may be taken aback by the switch, but those with open minds and ears will be treated to a pleasant surprise.\n\n        01\tMessin' With The Kid  \t\t\n\t02\tI'm Ready  \t\t\t\n\t03\tCalling Card  \t\t\t\n\t04\tCome on in My Kitchen  \t\t\t\n\t05\tHunter  \t\t\t\n\t06\tLike It This Way  \t\t\t\n\t07\tI Ain't Superstitious  \t\t\t\n\t08\tSpoonful  \t\t\t\n\t09\tReconsider Baby  \t\t\t\n\t10\tGood or Bad Times  \t\t\t\n\t11\t32/20 Blues  \t\t\t\n\t12\tWillin' For Satisfaction  \n\nsorry no album art in torrent header - BayImg down this morning","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92560c453f4d6fca6d27c4663db48e5562a89045","amp;dn":"Vivian+Campbell+-+Two+Sides+Of+If+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92560c453f4d6fca6d27c4663db48e5562a89045","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,86,12,69,63,77,111,202,109,39,196,102,61,180,142,85,98,168,144,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
