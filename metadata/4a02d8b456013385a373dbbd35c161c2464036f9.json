Unfortunately, Ajita thinks in pictures rather than numbers, and fails every Assessment and Exam. Her only escape is through her dreams, where strange people visit her and tell her star stories. When she befriends Yallie, a young Trainee who takes interest in her art, she believes sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s found a kindred spirit...until her dreams give her warnings of betrayal.
