In 1982, they\nrecorded the landmark New Gold Dream (81 82 83 84), which served as the template\nfor U2's The Unforgettable Fire two years later\n\nIn 1985, Simple Minds went stratospheric in the U.S. with their No. 1 Billboard\nHot 100 and Mainstream Rock single 'Don't You (Forget About Me),' memorably\nfeatured as the theme to the John Hughes film The Breakfast Club. Later that\nyear, the band released its most successful album, Once Upon a Time, which\nreached the Billboard 200's Top 10 and went gold, fueled by Top 5 Modern Rock\nhits 'Alive And Kicking' and 'Sanctify Yourself,' and the Top 10 'All The Things\nShe Said,' all of which are included on the new ICON collection, as well as a\nnew song, 'Broken Glass Park.'\n\n\nSEED AND HAVE FUN!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b05a3c7ec0f41862abd78d70c75d2edb8663d9ef","amp;dn":"Simple+Minds+-+Icon+-+404+%282013%29+MP3+%2F+VBR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b05a3c7ec0f41862abd78d70c75d2edb8663d9ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,90,60,126,192,244,24,98,171,215,141,112,199,93,46,219,134,99,217,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
