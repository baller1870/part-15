Join Dave Schultze for a fun, retro-inspired projectÃ¢â‚¬â€a &quot;Fish-Eye Frame&quot; media playerÃ¢â‚¬â€and learn everything you need to know about rendering product designs with Rhino. Discover what makes a good product rendering (and what makes a bad one). Then find out how to set up your virtual photo studio: arranging your camera, backdrop, and lighting for maximum impact. Dave will also show how to customize materials, add text and logos to your design, and trick out your render in post with new backgrounds and special effects. The workflow chapter contains bonus tips designed to speed up and smooth out the entire rendering and compositing process.\n\nTopics include:\nInstalling and activating V-Ray\nModeling tips for awesome renders\nUsing Dave's Glow-Wall Studio\nSetting up lighting and cameras\nExploring materials\nCreating text and logos\nMaking new backgrounds\nAdding depth of field\nOrganizing your studio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:494c9512d0b8592de76fe081a6418eb1fd60684c","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Rendering+with+Rhino+and+V-Ray+Product+Design","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"494c9512d0b8592de76fe081a6418eb1fd60684c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,76,149,18,208,184,89,45,231,111,224,129,166,65,142,177,253,96,104,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
