Perhaps the best-known (to a general old-time/blues audience) performer here is Son House, and the collection includes recordings of &quot;Mississippi County Farm Blues&quot; and &quot;Clarksdale Moan.&quot; Others might be familiar with Dock Boggs (&quot;Old Rub Alcohol Blues&quot;), Ken Maynard (&quot;Sweet Betsey from Pike&quot;), and the Memphis Jug Band (&quot;Jim Strainer Blues&quot;). Incredibly, several of these tracks were recorded as test pressings and never officially released, meaning that as far as the recording industry is concerned, they don't exist.\n\nIt's probable that all of the fuss made over this collection of rarities will make little sense to folks who don't spend all of their spare money and time hunting down 78-rpm records, and there's a point here. If you don't know that a certain item is rare, you won't value it in the same way a collector might. In this sense, one CD filled with scratchy old recordings is as good as another. But even for those who might not understand why they should be excited by The Stuff That Dreams Are Made Of, the collection nonetheless holds up as good old-time folk and blues, and expense-wise, Yazoo always offers lots of quality music for one's money. As an added bonus the cover art and inside cartoon has been put together by none other than Robert Crumb, a record collector and one-time string band performer himself.\n\nBitrate: 320K/s\nLabel: Yazoo\nStyles: Country blues, Country gospel, String bands, Bluegrass gospels, Acoustic blues\nYear: 2006\nArt: Front\n\n\nAlbum: The Stuff That Dreams Are Made Of: Super Rarities &amp; Unissued Gems Of The 1920s &amp; 30s (Disc 1) \nTime: 70:35\nSize: 167.3 MB \n\n[3:09] 1.
