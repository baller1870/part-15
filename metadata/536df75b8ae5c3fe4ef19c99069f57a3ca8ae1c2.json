Chef Robert Irvine has his hands full, between the books being a complete mess, the lackluster service, the reliance on the microwave in the kitchen and an owner who doesn't seem to realize that her business is failing. An unexpected boat trip may be what Gigi needs to wake up and turn her sinking ship around.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 29-Apr-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:536df75b8ae5c3fe4ef19c99069f57a3ca8ae1c2","amp;dn":"Restaurant.Impossible.S11E06.Going.Down.with.the.Ship.WS.DSR.x26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"536df75b8ae5c3fe4ef19c99069f57a3ca8ae1c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,109,247,91,138,229,195,254,78,241,156,153,6,159,87,163,202,138,225,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
