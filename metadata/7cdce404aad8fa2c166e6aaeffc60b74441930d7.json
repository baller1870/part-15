They are sorted into chapters according to style of beer--pale ales, brown ales, porters, stouts, European lagers, etc. There is also a chapter on meads, which are not beers at all but brews based on honey. As the book's very first sentence asserts, the recipes are &quot;for homebrewers&quot;--serious ones. Each recipe has been submitted by a particular homebrewer whose name and comments on the resulting potation introduce the list of ingredients and preparation directions. Libraries with homebrewers already in their clientele really ought to have it, and wherever the book is added, homebrewers might just start springing up. Ray Olson \n\nReview\n&quot;...a must for homebrewers interested in expanding their repertoire of beer creations.&quot; -- Beer, the magazine \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Homebrew-Favorites-Coast-Coast-Collection/dp/0882666134/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1251222529&amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Homebrew-Favorites-Coast-Coast-Collection/dp/0882666134/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1251222529&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cdce404aad8fa2c166e6aaeffc60b74441930d7","amp;dn":"Homebrew+Favorites.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cdce404aad8fa2c166e6aaeffc60b74441930d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,220,228,4,170,216,250,44,22,110,106,174,255,198,11,116,68,25,48,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
