This is definitely the better of the two 'at Music Inn' albums. \nI was present at the performances of &quot;Tunisia&quot; and &quot;Bag's Groove&quot; from Vol. 2. It was exciting at the time, of course, but doesn't hold up so well. For me, Rollins hit his peak with &quot;Saxophone Collossus&quot; and has been trying much too hard ever since. \n\nJackson, a genuine natural genius, benefitted from Lewis' imposed structures and control. He could do almost anything better than anyone else except Parker, but was at his best when put on the spot by Lewis as he is here. Giuffre fits in beautifully on his three tracks and contributes his intriguing composition, &quot;Fun&quot;, with its changing moods and challenges for the expanded group. &quot;Two Degrees East/Three Degrees West&quot; is one of Lewis' lasting classic pieces. &quot;Bess, You is My Bess&quot; is among the loveliest pieces the Quartet ever played; Jackson's brief solo on it is just stunning. \n\nThe MJQ version is as good in its way as the Miles Davis/Gill Evans version, which is the standard by which all the hundreds of others are measured.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
