In his kind, yet lonely journey, this man of compassion also seeks something else, a mate--someone to love--willing to return all the kindness he&amp;#039;s shown his less fortunate troup of oddities. When he finds that someone, his life is complete...until her pregnancy. She gifts him with a &quot;special&quot; child of his own. His fury at God and the world for such a betrayal, drive him to a state of revenge and hatred that reveals his true inner self -a self his traveling carnival of &quot;special people&quot; wreak their own twisted revenge upon.&quot;\n\nWritten by BRUCE JONES\nArt by BERNIE WRIGHTSON\nCover by BERNIE WRIGHTSON\n\nPublisher: Desperado / Image comics.\nYear: 2005.
