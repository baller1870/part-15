The record unfolds gradually, as the jazzy textures of &quot;Shine on You Crazy Diamond&quot; reveal its melodic motif, and in its leisurely pace, the album shows itself to be a warmer record than its predecessor. Musically, it's arguably even more impressive, showcasing the group's interplay and David Gilmour's solos in particular. And while it's short on actual songs, the long, winding soundscapes are constantly enthralling.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80c27679da88d4e8b1c89c0649641b097f4a7ad2","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+Wish+You+Were+Here+24+Bit+Vinyl+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80c27679da88d4e8b1c89c0649641b097f4a7ad2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,194,118,121,218,136,212,232,177,200,156,6,73,100,27,9,127,74,122,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
