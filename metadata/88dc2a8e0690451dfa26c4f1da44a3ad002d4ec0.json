The plot adroitly mixes music, smaltz and sentiment with several scenes of heartbreaking, dramatic power. This movie is an absolute joy, a treasure to be seen and enjoyed year after year.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88dc2a8e0690451dfa26c4f1da44a3ad002d4ec0","amp;dn":"The+Great+Waltz+%5B1938-ENG%5D+DvDrip.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88dc2a8e0690451dfa26c4f1da44a3ad002d4ec0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,220,42,142,6,144,69,29,250,38,196,241,218,68,163,173,0,45,78,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
