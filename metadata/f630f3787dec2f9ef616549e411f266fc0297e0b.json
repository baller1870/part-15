The player\n  will take control of four characters whose lives become entangled in the\n  search for the scientistÃƒâ€ s vault. They will have to learn to trust each\n  other and work together to overcome the obstacles in their way and to keep\n  this new and powerful technology out of the hands of a dangerous\n  organization.\n \n  URL: http://www.wadjeteyegames.com/resonance.html\n  URL: http://www.gog.com/gamecard/resonance\n\n  1. UnRAR\n  2. Run update\n  3. Play the game\n\n  Tired about all the self-made CD/DVD images made from download versions of\n  the games? Our games are made from physical sources if possible - like in\n  the good old times and how we think it should still be done. In our opinion\n  digital download versions should be tagged as such or at least it should be\n  noted in the nfo. Also we think that physical sources never could be dupes\n  of digital versions as well as CD versions are no dupes of DVD ones. All\n  old and still active scene rules proof that we are right (the new S.I.R\n  rules from 2009 and 2010 are not signed by any scene group and are not\n  active because of that).\n \n  Also keep in mind that digital download games below 350mb in size belong\n  into 0day section and not into gameiso. We have seen digital download games\n  that are some gigabytes in size in the 0day section. So please make the\n  right decision.\n \n  We bring you games that other groups do not do. We are different, like us\n  or hate us. You think some games that we release are crap? We do not care\n  because we think that scene means that every game should be released.\n \n  To rise the quality of our releases we now try to make all our releases\n  both in normal image format (bin/cue or iso) as requested by the scene\n  rules and also in clone (Alcohol 120%) format.\n\n  0x0815 - 0x0007 - FLT - GENESiS - GREENPEACE - JAGUAR - PROPHET - POSTMORTEM \n                          Razor1911 - RELOADED - VACE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f630f3787dec2f9ef616549e411f266fc0297e0b","amp;dn":"Resonance.Update.v1.3-FASDOX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f630f3787dec2f9ef616549e411f266fc0297e0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,48,243,120,125,236,47,158,246,22,84,158,65,31,38,111,192,41,126,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
