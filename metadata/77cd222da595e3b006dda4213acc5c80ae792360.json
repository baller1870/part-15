Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (often shortened to Sgt. Pepper) is the eighth studio album by English rock band the Beatles. Released in June 1967, the album included songs such as &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;, &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;, and &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;. Continuing the artistic maturation seen on the band's album Revolver (1966), Sgt. Pepper further departed from the conventional pop rock idiom of the time and incorporated balladry, psychedelic, music hall, and symphonic influences.[3]\nDuring the Sgt. Pepper sessions, the group improved upon the quality of their music's production while exploring experimental recording techniques. Producer George Martin's innovative approach included the use of an orchestra. Widely acclaimed and imitated, the album cover, designed by English pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, was inspired by a sketch by Paul McCartney that depicted the band posing in front of a collage of some of their favourite celebrities.\nSgt. Pepper was a worldwide critical and commercial success, spending 27 weeks at the top of the UK Album Chart and 15 weeks at number one on the US Billboard 200. A seminal work in the emerging psychedelic rock style, the album was critically acclaimed upon release and won four Grammy Awards in 1968. With an estimated 32 million copies sold, it is one of the world's best selling albums. Sgt. Pepper is considered by many to be the most influential and famous rock album ever, and has been named the greatest album of all time by both All Time Top 1000 Albums and Rolling Stone.\n\nTracklist:\nA1 Sgt.
