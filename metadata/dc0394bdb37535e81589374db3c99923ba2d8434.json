Communication Breakdown\r\n\r\nComments: \r\nNot as good as the first week and also a little more tension \r\nin the air. Some songs sound very sloppy, almost like the band \r\ndoesn't want to be there, but then again, some sound excellent. \r\nThe opening 45 minutes or so sound strong and good, but the \r\nintensity starts to flag towards the end. Jimmy butchers the \r\nsolo in Whole Lotta Love, and the end encores sound tired \r\n(&quot;Can you do the dinosaur rock?&quot; reflected what the band \r\nthought playing these old tunes). This was also the last \r\nconcert in the United Kingdom but Robert, before as he left \r\nthe stage, said: &quot;We'll see you soon. Very soon. Don't know \r\nabout the Marquee, but somewhere soon.&quot; They couldn't knew \r\nwhat happened a year later. Some problems with Page's guitar \r\nand PA system truncated Over The Hills And Far Away and Misty \r\nMountain Hop","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc0394bdb37535e81589374db3c99923ba2d8434","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1979.08.11+Knebworth+Festival%2C+England+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc0394bdb37535e81589374db3c99923ba2d8434","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,3,148,189,179,117,53,232,21,137,55,77,179,201,153,35,186,45,132,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
