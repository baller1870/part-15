One of the most famous battles in history, Gallipoli forced Churchill from office, established Turkey's iconic founder Mustafa Kemal ('Ataturk') and marked Australia's emergence as a nation in its own right. \n\nIt had begun as a bold move led by the British to ultimately capture Constantinople, but this definitive new history explains that from the initial landings - which ended with so much blood in the sea it could be seen from aircraft overhead - to the desperate attacks of early summer and the battle of attrition that followed, it was a lunacy that was never going to succeed. \n\nDrawing on unpublished personal accounts by individuals at all levels and from all sides - not only from Britain, Australia and New Zealand, but unusually from Turkey and France too - Peter Hart combines his trademark eye for vivid personal stories with a strong narrative to bring a modern view of this military disaster to a popular audience.\n\nGenre: Non Fiction , History","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d97bdaf2e2070d2d999fc410a5433ccbf8004f23","amp;dn":"Gallipoli+by+Peter+Hart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d97bdaf2e2070d2d999fc410a5433ccbf8004f23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,123,218,242,226,7,13,45,153,159,196,16,165,67,60,203,248,0,79,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
