But today, debating has a whole new look: one in which debaters deliver rapid-fire statements full of specialized jargon at a rate of up to an astonishing and virtually incomprehensible 400 words per minute. This documentary sheds light on the win-at-all-costs tactics of top high-school debaters--and shows how an unlikely duo devised a strategy of bringing debate back to its roots by refocusing on personal experience and dialogue. Interviews include several well-known former debaters including Josh Lucas, Jane Pauley, Karl Rove, Samuel Alito and Juan Williams.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65948e2f0a0ac339eb3398605e013ecfa2293a7c","amp;dn":"Resolved+%282007%29+-+A+Movie+About+Policy+Debate","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65948e2f0a0ac339eb3398605e013ecfa2293a7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,148,142,47,10,10,195,57,235,51,152,96,94,1,62,207,162,41,58,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
