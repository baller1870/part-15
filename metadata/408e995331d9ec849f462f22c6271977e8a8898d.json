It includes works by the most famous English artists, such as Thomas Gainsborough, Joseph Mallord William Turner, John Constable, Edward Burne- Jones, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. This subject is introduced with a very unique text, published in 1882: a French study of English pictorial art. The author, Ernest Chesneau, was highly-cultured, an art historian and inspector of Fine Arts. He explains the beginnings of this school which excels in portraiture and landscapes, and reminds us of the English brilliance regarding watercolours, not forgetting to include the work of the Pre-Raphaelites.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:408e995331d9ec849f462f22c6271977e8a8898d","amp;dn":"English+Painting+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"408e995331d9ec849f462f22c6271977e8a8898d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,142,153,83,49,217,236,132,159,70,47,34,198,39,25,119,232,168,137,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
