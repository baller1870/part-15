What if a person is buried too soon? What happens to a thief foolish enough to rob a corpse, or to a murderer whose victim returns from the grave? Read about these terrifying predicaments as well as what happens when practical jokes produce gruesome consequences and initiations go awry.\n\nStephen Gammell's splendidly creepy drawings perfectly capture the mood of more than two dozen scary stories -- and even a scary song -- all just right for reading alone or for telling aloud in the dark.\n\nIf You Dare!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f5c7ab656fb92d9b895d3ca3716ce0142842b0f","amp;dn":"More+Scary+Stories+by+Alvin+Schwartz+%28mobi%2C+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f5c7ab656fb92d9b895d3ca3716ce0142842b0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,92,122,182,86,251,146,217,184,149,211,202,55,22,206,1,66,132,43,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
