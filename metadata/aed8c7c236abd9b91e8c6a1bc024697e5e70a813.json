Marga is a highly motivated, arrogant and successful businesswoman on assignment in Buenos Aires Ã¢â‚¬â€ a city she hates and whose people she loathes. While in the Argentina capital on a day the whole population is waiting to view a rare solar eclipse she must also find a new tenant for her familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decrepit apartment. Rapidly losing her patience waiting for one applicant she runs into the mysterious Jorge lurking outside the front door of the place who informs her that he has a client willing to pay four times what she is asking in rent. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one catch Ã¢â‚¬â€ the paperwork must be signed immediately. As greedy Marga waits to complete the transaction several of JorgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s associates suspiciously appear at the apartment ready to strip the wallpaper. And whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s behind the dÃƒÂ©cor signals a startling fate worse than death Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or should that be life!\n\nGenre: Horror | Thriller\nIMDB rating: 6.1/10\nDirected by: AdriÃƒÂ¡n GarcÃƒÂ­a Bogliano, Ramiro GarcÃƒÂ­a Bogliano\nStarring: Cristina Brondo, Camila Bordonaba and Berta MuÃƒÂ±iz\n\nRelease Name: Penumbra.2011.DVDSCR.AC3-2.0.XviD-SiC\nSize: 1.37 GiB\nVideo: XviD, 656 x 272, 1 904 Kbps\nAudio: Spanish, AC-3, 256 Kbps\nRuntime: 1h 30mn\nSubtitle: English hardcoded\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aed8c7c236abd9b91e8c6a1bc024697e5e70a813","amp;dn":"Penumbra.2011.DVDSCR.AC3-2.0.XviD.SBT.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aed8c7c236abd9b91e8c6a1bc024697e5e70a813","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,216,199,194,54,171,217,185,30,140,106,27,192,36,105,126,94,112,168,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
