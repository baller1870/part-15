The application comes with support for microtonal MIDI recording and playback options. It allows you to work with non-12-TET tunings and pitch systems, offering you full control over the lines and pitches.\n\n\n\nNew in Mus2\n\nMicrotonal MIDI recording\n\nImproved instrument sound samples and better playback\nSpecial navigation mode for Turkish music notation\nBar repeat signs\nAhenk (diapason) options for duplicating tunings and transposition in Holdrian commas\nAdjustable MIDI pitch bend range\nMetronome instrument options\n\nCustom Accidentals\n\nImport symbols from vector graphics and music fonts into Mus2 to create your own accidentals. Not only can you easily adjust the layout and musical meaning of these symbols, you can also use them with notes and in key signatures just like any other accidental. For a quick start, Mus2 comes with quartertone symbols and accidentals used in Turkish classical and folk music.\n\nIntonation ally Correct Playback\n\nHear your score performed by sampled acoustic and electronic instruments in any tuning. Mus2 understands and plays back the articulations, ornaments, dynamic markings and other symbols in your score. The polyphony ( number of simultaneous notes ) limitation commonly found in other MIDI-based microtonal solutions does not exist in Mus2. When you do need the sound processing capabilities of other music software, simply export your score as a MIDI, Wave or AIFF file.\n\nMicrotonal MIDI Recording\n\nConnect a keyboard or any other MIDI-compatible instrument and record music in any tuning. You can create key mappings for your tunings to assign each key to an arbitrary pitch and, thanks to Mus2's microtonal sampler, get real-time intonation ally accurate playback. Once you're done recording and editing with the built-in sequencer, simply copy the recorded passage and paste it onto a staff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupported Operating Systems:\n\n   Win XP\n   Win Vista\n   Win 7\n   Win 8\nProcessor: Pentium IV 2.5 GHz\nMemory: 1 GB\nFree Disk Space: 250 MB\nSound: DirectX 9.0 compatible audio interface\nRecording: MIDI instrument\n\n\n\n\nInstallation:\n\n             \n\n              1.
