The charity single was intended to raise funds to help famine-relief efforts in Africa, which had experienced unusual drought in 1984/1985.\n\nWhen released as a single, &quot;We Are The World&quot; rose the charts rapidly in the U.S., &quot;one of the fastest-selling singles of the modern pop era,&quot; reaching #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 on April 17, 1985 and remaining there for four weeks. It immediately sold out its initial shipment of 800,000 copies, and sales reached 1.5 million shortly afterwards. It also reached #1 in the UK, and made the top spot in almost every country throughout the world. In the UK, it was the 33rd best-selling single of 1985.\n\nUSA for Africa (United Support of Artists for Africa) was the name under which forty-five predominantly U.S. artists, led by Harry Belafonte, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, and Lionel Richie, recorded the hit single &quot;We Are the World&quot; in 1985. The song was a US and UK Number One for the collective in April of that year.\n\nThe considerable profits from the enterprise went to the USA for Africa Foundation, which used them for the relief of famine and disease in Africa and specifically to 1984ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1985 famine in Ethiopia; critics, however, claim that this money went directly to the (often military) governments of the affected countries rather than the people.\n\nUSA for Africa also held a benefit event, Hands Across America, in which approximately seven million people held hands in a human chain for fifteen minutes along a path across the continental United States. Participants paid ten dollars to stand in line and the money raised was used to fight hunger and homelessness in Africa.\n\nThe combined revenues raised from the sales of &quot;We Are the World&quot; and Hands Across America was almost $100 million.\n\nSolos (in order of first appearance)\n\n    * Lionel Richie\n    * Stevie Wonder\n    * Paul Simon\n    * Kenny Rogers\n    * James Ingram\n    * Tina Turner\n    * Billy Joel\n    * Michael Jackson\n    * Diana Ross\n    * Dionne Warwick\n    * Willie Nelson\n    * Al Jarreau\n    * Bruce Springsteen\n    * Kenny Loggins\n    * Steve Perry\n    * Daryl Hall\n    * Huey Lewis\n    * Cyndi Lauper\n    * Kim Carnes\n    * Bob Dylan\n    * Ray Charles\n\n[edit] Extras\n\n    * Dan Aykroyd\n    * Harry Belafonte\n    * Lindsey Buckingham\n    * The News\n    * Sheila E.\n    * Bob Geldof\n    * Jackie Jackson\n    * LaToya Jackson\n    * Marlon Jackson\n    * Randy Jackson\n    * Tito Jackson\n    * Waylon Jennings\n    * Bette Midler\n    * John Oates\n    * Jeffrey Osborne\n    * The Pointer Sisters\n    * Smokey Robinson\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:417aea53f9cb3fb8c9ca7283a4bade9631f2aaa3","amp;dn":"USA+For+Africa+-+We+Are+The+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"417aea53f9cb3fb8c9ca7283a4bade9631f2aaa3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,122,234,83,249,203,63,184,201,202,114,131,164,186,222,150,49,242,170,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
