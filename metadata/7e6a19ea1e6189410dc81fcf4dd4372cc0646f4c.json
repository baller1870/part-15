It was written in 1981 and featured Mick Jones on lead vocals. It became the band&amp;#039;s only number-one single, a decade after it was originally released. In November 2004, it was ranked at 228 on Rolling Stone&amp;#039;s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\nThe tune leans towards more of a retro punk rock sound than most of the other tracks on the album. Though many legends have arisen about what the song is about (one of which is Jones&amp;#039; impending dismissal from the Clash in 1983), it is actually about a rocky personal relationship between Jones and former Meat Loaf backup singer Ellen Foley that would soon implode. The lyrics seem to reflect ups and downs concerning the relationship and the dilemma of sticking with or ending it.\nThe Spanish backing vocals are courtesy of Joe Strummer.\n\nLyrics:\nDarling you gotta let me know\nShould I stay or should I go?\nIf you say that you are mine\nIll be here til the end of time\nSo you got to let know\nShould I stay or should I go?\n\nAlways tease tease tease\nSiempre - coqetiando y enganyando\nYoure happy when Im on my knees\nMe arrodilla y estas feliz\nOne day is fine, next is black\nUn dias bien el otro negro\nSo if you want me off your back\nAl rededar en tu espalda\nWell come on and let me know\nMe tienes que desir\nShould I stay or should I go?\nMe debo ir o que darme\n\nShould I stay or should I go now?\nShould I stay or should I go now?\nIf I go there will be trouble\nAn if I stay it will be double\nSo come on and let me know\n\nThis indecisions bugging me\nEsta undecision me molesta\nIf you dont want me, set me free\nSi no me quieres, librame\nExactly whom Im supposed to be\nDiga me que tengo ser\nDont you know which clothes even fit me?\nsaves que robas me querda?\nCome on and let me know\nMe tienes que desir\nShould I cool it or should I blow?\nme debo ir o quedarme?\n\nShould I stay or should I go now?\nyo me frio o lo sophlo?\nIf I go there will be trouble\nSi me voi - va ver peligro\nAnd if I stay it will be double\nSi me quedo es doble\nSo you gotta let me know\nMe tienes que decir\nShould I stay or should I go?\nyo me frio o lo sophlo?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e6a19ea1e6189410dc81fcf4dd4372cc0646f4c","amp;dn":"The+Clash+-+Should+I+Stay+Or+Should+I+Go","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e6a19ea1e6189410dc81fcf4dd4372cc0646f4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,106,25,234,30,97,137,65,13,200,31,207,77,212,55,44,192,100,111,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
