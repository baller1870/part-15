Upon arriving at the Carriage House studio in Los AngelesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Silverlake neighborhood, the trio went on to write and record nine original acoustic songs. Harrison compared the trio's collaborative process to his father's stint in The Traveling Wilburys.\n\nAfter recording the nine tracks, Harrison called longtime friend and drummer Jim Keltner to overdub on percussion. Violinist Jessy Greene also participated in the recording.\n\nThe band subsequently made their live debut in a performance for KCRW's Morning Becomes Eclectic on August 26, 2010. Fistful of Mercy released their debut album As I Call You Down on October 5, 2010 via HOT Records.\n\nThe band was mentioned in a storyline of the NBC series Parenthood where a few characters went to a Fistful of Mercy concert in the Season 2 episode &quot;I'm a Lot Cooler Than You Think&quot;. Fistful of Mercy's song &quot;In Vain or True&quot; is also played during scenes of the episode. On November 10th, the band performed the song &quot;Father's Son&quot; with special guest Tom Morello on the third episode of Conan.\n\nAs I Call You Down is the debut album by American rock supergroup Fistful of Mercy, released on October 5, 2010.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistful_of_Mercy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistful_of_Mercy&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_I_Call_You_Down&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_I_Call_You_Down&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFistful of Mercy is entirely too aggressive a name for the ramshackle trio of Ben Harper, Joseph Arthur, and Dhani Harrison, a group of neo-hippies whose respective circles conjoined so they decided to strum some acoustic guitars together and see what happened. What happened was a collection of nine pleasant folk-rock tunes tinged with a little blues and a lot of softly psychedelic twists reminiscent of DhaniÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dad, George. The melodies may recall the elder Harrison but the overall feel is uncannily CSN at their softest, the harmonies always gentle and the tempos never moving any faster than a lazy stroll. The mellow vibes are appealing in their own lackadaisical way, but as the short LP approaches its conclusion itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hard not to wish there was just a little more discipline, perhaps enough to sculpt these pleasant sounds into full songs.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/as-i-call-you-down-r1967378&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/as-i-call-you-down-r1967378&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
