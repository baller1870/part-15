It became a hit single in 1984 for female R&amp;B singer Chaka Khan, appearing on her album, which was also called I Feel For You. The repetition of Khan&amp;#039;s name by rapper Melle Mel at the beginning of the song was originally a mistake made by producer Arif Mardin, who then decided to keep it. Khan&amp;#039;s version featured an all-star supporting cast, with rapping from Melle Mel, keyboard and guitar by The System, and harmonica playing and sampled vocals by Stevie Wonder. Also, samples from Wonder&amp;#039;s &quot;Fingertips Part 2&quot; are used.\n\nThis version of the song became a million-selling smash in the U.S. and UK, and it helped to relaunch Khan&amp;#039;s career. The song peaked at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in December of 1984, matching her previous highest pop chart position from ten years prior (the 1974 hit single, &quot;Tell Me Something Good&quot;, which she recorded with the band Rufus). The single reached #1 on both the U.S. R&amp;B and dance charts in late 1984, remaining atop both for three weeks apiece. In addition, the song also reached #1 on the UK Singles Chart. While touring with Prince in 1998 in support of her collaborative album, Come 2 My House, Khan and Prince performed &quot;I Feel for You&quot; as a duet.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c39532d9e1669f7c4c08b6a06e67db05c780c9b","amp;dn":"Chaka+Khan+-+I+Feel+For+You","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c39532d9e1669f7c4c08b6a06e67db05c780c9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,57,83,45,158,22,105,247,196,192,139,106,6,230,125,176,92,120,12,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
