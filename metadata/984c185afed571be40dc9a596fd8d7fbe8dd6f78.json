While it may be available on AudioSparx along with an unlimited distribution license for $479.80, it is available in lossy formats at iTunes, Amazon and CD Baby. My guess is that there may be a few copies of the &quot;Offering&quot; CD album floating around at CD exchanges in the Colorado area.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:984c185afed571be40dc9a596fd8d7fbe8dd6f78","amp;dn":"Portal+-+The+Definitive+Lossless+Soundtrack+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"984c185afed571be40dc9a596fd8d7fbe8dd6f78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,76,24,90,254,213,113,190,64,220,154,89,111,216,215,251,232,221,111,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
