McPhersonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Battle Cry of Freedom. Where other scholars have seen the conflict as a triumph of freedom, Goldfield paints it as AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest failure: a breakdown of society caused by the infusion of evangelical religion into the world of politics.\n\nThe price of that failure was horrific, but the carnage accomplished what statesmen could not: It made the United States one nation and eliminated the divisive force of slavery. The victorious North moved ahead, a land of innovation and industry. Religion was supplanted by a gospel of economic and scientific progress, and the South was left behind. The &quot;fiery trial&quot; of war transformed our countryÃ¢â‚¬â€a conflagration captured in vivid detail in America Aflame.\n\nPublishers Weekly\nThis sweeping, provocative history of America from the 1830s through Reconstruction has two grand themes. One is the importance of evangelical Protestantism, particularly in the North and within the Republican Party, in changing slavery from a political problem to an intractable moral issue that could only be settled by bloodshed. The second is the Civil War's transformation of America into a modern industrial nation with a powerful government and a commercial, scientific outlook, even as the postwar South stagnated in racism and backward-looking religiosity. UNC-Charlotte historian Goldfield (Still Fighting the Civil War) courts controversy by shifting more responsibility for the conflict to an activist North and away from intransigent slaveholders, whom he likens to Indians, Mexicans, and other targets viewed by white evangelical Northerners as &quot;polluting&quot; the spreading western frontier. Still, he presents a superb, stylishly written historical synthesis that insightfully foregrounds ideology, faith, and public mood The book is, the author writes, &quot;neither pro-southern nor pro-northern,&quot; but rather &quot;antiwar.&quot; Goldfield's narrative of the war proper is especially good, evoking the horror of the fighting and its impact on soldiers and civilians. The result is an ambitious, engrossing interpretation with new things to say about a much-studied conflagration.\n\nMeet the Author\nDavid Goldfield is the Robert Lee Bailey Professor of History at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte. He is the author of many works and textbooks on Southern history, including Still Fighting the Civil War, Southern Histories, Black, White and Southern, and Promised Land.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb064bda83d46919373a439d5c811b65a3b84af2","amp;dn":"David+Goldfield+-+America+Aflame+-+How+the+Civil+War+Created+a+N","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb064bda83d46919373a439d5c811b65a3b84af2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,6,75,218,131,212,105,25,55,58,67,157,92,129,27,101,163,184,74,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
