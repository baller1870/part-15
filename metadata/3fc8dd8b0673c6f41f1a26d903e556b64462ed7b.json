Still,\nthere are moments on `Roll Away` that will firmly recall the sounds of classic\nCreem and Blind Faith - not a bad thing and not an easy thing to pull off. &quot;4\nstars. Who would have thought the guy who sang &quot;money for nothing and your\nchicks for free&quot; could inspire a kid to grow up and become one of the most\npromising bluesmen of his generation -- at the tender age of 20? The listener\ndoesn`t need to know the back story of this slamming, high-intensity Isle of\nMan-based blues-rock trio led by multi-talented singer, songwriter, and\nguitarist Davy Knowles to be inspired by the band`s blistering excitement. But\nlike all tales of great blues makers, origins are important, so here goes: at\nage 11, Knowles was in the car with his father and heard Dire Straits` &quot;Sultans\nof Swing,&quot; which changed his life and put him on a mission to explore Dad`s vast\nrecord collection. This included John Mayall`s Bluesbreakers, Eric Clapton,\nPeter Green, and Rory Gallagher. Then Knowles started listening to their\ninfluences, soaking up Blind Willie Johnson and Robert Johnson. Back Door Slam`s\nin-your-face debut rumbles out of the gate with the rollicking rocker &quot;Come\nHome,&quot; a perfect intro to Knowles` crisply sizzling licks and gruff, wise, and\npained-beyond-his-years vocals.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fc8dd8b0673c6f41f1a26d903e556b64462ed7b","amp;dn":"Back_Door_Slam-Roll_Away-%28Reissue%29-2010-404","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fc8dd8b0673c6f41f1a26d903e556b64462ed7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,200,221,139,6,115,198,244,31,26,38,217,3,229,86,182,68,98,237,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
