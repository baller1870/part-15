The game objective consists of following Iron Maiden's mascot, Eddie, through various levels depicting the band's past album covers. The accompanying CDs have the group's most popular songs, as selected by fans on the band's official website.\n\nThe album was released alongside a tour of the same name, in which the band only played songs which were featured in the compilation. The tour itself was also notable for marking the return of former guitarist Adrian Smith and vocalist Bruce Dickinson, who had left the band in 1990 and 1993, respectively.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Iron Maiden&quot; (Live) \t  \t4:27\n02. \t&quot;The Trooper&quot;   \t  \t4:11\n03. \t&quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;   \t  \t4:51\n04. \t&quot;Wrathchild&quot;   \t  \t2:54\n05. \t&quot;Futureal&quot;   \tHarris, Blaze Bayley \t2:54\n06. \t&quot;Fear of the Dark&quot;   \t  \t7:17\n07. \t&quot;Be Quick or Be Dead&quot;   \tBruce Dickinson, Janick Gers \t3:24\n08. \t&quot;2 Minutes to Midnight&quot;   \tAdrian Smith, Dickinson \t6:00\n09. \t&quot;Man on the Edge&quot;   \tBayley, Gers \t4:11\n10. \t&quot;Aces High&quot;   \t  \t4:29\n11. \t&quot;The Evil That Men Do&quot;   \tSmith, Dickinson, Harris \t4:34\n12. \t&quot;Wasted Years&quot;   \tSmith \t5:05\n13. \t&quot;Powerslave&quot;   \tDickinson \t6:48\n14. \t&quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot;   \t  \t7:14\n\nUS Bonus Track \t\n15. \t&quot;Wrathchild '99&quot;   \t2:56\n\n\nDisc 2 \t\n\n01. \t&quot;Run to the Hills&quot;   \t  \t3:54\n02. \t&quot;The Clansman&quot;   \t  \t8:59\n03. \t&quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;   \t  \t7:06\n04. \t&quot;Killers&quot;   \tHarris, Paul Di'Anno \t5:00\n05. \t&quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;   \tSmith \t5:43\n06. \t&quot;Tailgunner&quot;   \tHarris, Dickinson \t4:15","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a66bd3bafaec83cf70603e514da7297c3c9f028e","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+Ed+Hunter+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a66bd3bafaec83cf70603e514da7297c3c9f028e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,107,211,186,250,236,131,207,112,96,62,81,77,167,41,124,60,159,2,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
