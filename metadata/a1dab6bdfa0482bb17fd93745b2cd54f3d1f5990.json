Their music may best be described as a cross between heavy metal, Thrash metal and rock'n'roll.\n\nCrucified Barbara started out in 1998 as a punk rock band, but they speedily shifted their style to heavy metal. They signed in 2003 with GMR Music Group of Stockholm. Recordings took place in Kristianopel, Sweden at Pama Studios/Blakk Records with producer-engineer Mankan Sedenberg during the spring of 2004. Their advance debut single from their first album In Distortion We Trust, was &quot;Losing the Game&quot;. It was released on 8 December 2005 and went straight to #8 on the Swedish music charts. The video to accompany it was recorded and produced by M Industries. The album was released in Sweden on 19 January and is available outside Sweden in several countries including the U.K, the U.S.A, France, Germany, and Benelux. In 2006, they contributed two songs, &quot;Killed by Death&quot; and &quot;Please Don't Touch&quot;, to St. Valentines Day Massacre, a tribute album to MotÃƒÂ¶rhead.\n\n\n\n2014 In The Red\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.

Follow The Stream\n\nLabel: Despotz Records\n\n\nUncompromising is the word that lodged itself in my brain the first time I listened to Crucified Barbara. They are an all-girl hard rock band based in the Swedish capital known for the energy and raw emotion they bring into live shows. The quartet started as a duo when bassist Ida and guitarist Klara met up while in their teens. As they were looking for a drummer, Nicki popped out of the woodwork carrying two drumsticks. And when Joey Nine, the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s initial vocalist quit the group in 2003, an opportunity opened up for Mia to join. Since then StockholmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bars and clubs have been haunted by the rich, melodic, no-holds-barred brand of metal that Crucified Barbara have become known for. 2005 saw the release of their debut Ã¢â‚¬ËœIn Distortion We TrustÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and since then the girls have made a name for themselves all over Europe and in the U.S., playing alongside the likes of Backyard Babies and Motorhead. They also released two more credible albums. Almost a decade later Crucified Barbara has come into its own and released an 11-track album that is more expressive of the individual personalities and worldview. Recorded in the legendary Music-A-Matic studio and christened In The Red, it is the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most polished project to date.\n\nCrucified Barbara debunk the assumption that being an all-chick band has anything to do with how hard they rock right from the gate. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Sell My Kids For Rock N RollÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a hand to the face of anyone questioning Crucified BarbaraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s commitment to the craft. It is a breathless cut that threatens to snap the vertebrae of all who attempt to head-bang in time with it. And if the reckless tempo doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get you, the bawling guitars will numb your brain. Next is the anti-rape anthem Ã¢â‚¬Å“To Kill a ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Calling a chorus that goes Ã¢â‚¬Å“I wonder how it feels to kill a man, empowered by the fearÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ powerful might be considered understating things. But the message against rape, in any of its shades, needs to be driven home with all necessary force. And the video in which such chilling statistics as Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ1 in 4 women in the UK will suffer domestic abuse in their lifetimeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ flash intermittently, does just that. The anger and fear of the many victims of this horrendous crime are embodied in MiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s screechy voice as she ploughs through verse after verse, describing the cockiness of predators and the helplessness of the prey. The passion is also transmitted through the tortured guitar chords. However, the gravity of the subject matter in no way detracts from the excellence of the musicianship on display.\n\nA shot of adrenaline is then injected into the mix, pulling the tempo back up to danceable levels in the next cut Ã¢â‚¬Å“Electric SkyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. It is followed by the upbeat, inspirational Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ghost InsideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. You are persuaded to pay no mind to the nay-saying voices in your head and push on, living life to the fullest, but then on the very next track youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re warned Ã¢â‚¬Å“DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Call On MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Mia and her bandmates arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t shooing you away, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re talking to someone who failed them in the past, or so it sounds. Whoever theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re talking about or to, this is my type of song- a steady, bass-driven, snare-splashing melody sped up in parts and slowed down to let you drink in the warning at the hook. There is something dramatically dusky about the way the track kicks off that sucks you in and cements your ears to the speakers.\n\nThe quintessential party song in every rock album is the title track Ã¢â‚¬Å“In The RedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. This is where you stop listening to the lyrics and take a carefree ride on the undulating riffs and allow Nicki to pound your eardrums sore. And the party continues with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lunatic #1Ã¢â‚¬Â³ which is a one-size-fits-all for any mosh pit. If you thought Crucified Barbara were the kind to wrap up an album with a quiet, contemplative number, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Follow The StreamÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ will make you think again. Nicki smashes at the drums with renewed vigor and Ida and Klara keep pace with her right to the prolonged conclusion.\n\n\n\n\nAs requested by a fellow member Bajen88 from Sweden!\nGenre:\tHeavy\nSubgenre:\tHard Rock / Heavy Metal\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t91.70 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n11 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1dab6bdfa0482bb17fd93745b2cd54f3d1f5990","amp;dn":"Crucified+Barbara+-+In+The+Red+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1dab6bdfa0482bb17fd93745b2cd54f3d1f5990","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,218,182,189,250,4,130,187,23,253,147,116,91,44,213,79,61,31,89,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
