How did this array of form and habitat come about, and how do we humans interact with the plant kingdom? This unique new textbook provides a refreshing and stimulating consideration of these questions and throws light in a new way on the complexity, ecology, evolution and development of plants and our relationship with them. Illustrated throughout with numerous line diagrams and beautiful colour photographs, the book provides a comprehensive introduction to the fascinating lives that plants lead and the way in which our lives are inextricably linked to theirs. It will be particularly useful to students seeking a more ecological and process-oriented approach than is available in other plant science textbooks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b10c43e0a8230d3c27e5187e00044ccaf9bc212","amp;dn":"Ingrouille+%282006%29+Plants+-+diversity+and+evolution","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b10c43e0a8230d3c27e5187e00044ccaf9bc212","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,16,196,62,10,130,48,211,194,126,81,135,224,0,68,204,175,155,194,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
