Zhao spent the last years of his life under house arrest. An occasional detail about his life would slip out, but scholars and citizens lamented that Zhao never had his final say.But Zhao did produce a memoir, secretly recording on audio tapes the real story of what happened during modern ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most critical moments. He provides intimate details about the Tiananmen crackdown, describes the ploys and double crosses used by ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leaders, and exhorts China to adopt democracy in order to achieve long-term stability. His riveting, behind-the-scenes recollections form the basis of Prisoner of the State.The China that Zhao portrays is not some long-lost dynasty. It is todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s China, where its leaders accept economic freedom but resist political change. Zhao might have steered ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s political system toward openness and tolerance had he survived. Although Zhao now speaks from the grave, his voice still has the moral power to make China sit up and listen.\n\nEditorial Reviews\nPerry Link\nThe material is largely consistent with what is already known from the The Tiananmen Papers, an unauthorized compilation of government documents published in 2001, and from Captive Conversations, a Chinese-language record of conversations between Zhao and his friend Zong Fengming, published in 2007. But the up-close-and-personal tone of the present book stands out.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€The Washington Post\n\nMeet the Author\nZHAO ZIYANG was the Premier of China from 1983 until 1987 when he became the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, a position he held until 1989 when he was deposed and put under house arrest until his death in 2005.\nAdi Ignatius is an American journalist who covered China for The Wall Street Journal during the Zhao Ziyang era.
