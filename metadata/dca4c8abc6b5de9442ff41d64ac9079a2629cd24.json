Kate's journey along the 2,000-mile trail that first connected the Arab world with the West takes her on a quest that's steeped in history, searing with desert heat, and full of characters and adventure. For 3,000 years before the birth of Christ, frankincense was more valuable than gold. Its sweet smelling aromatic smoke was treasured by Pharaohs and Caesars, and their insatiable demand for frankincense created a trade route from the southern coast of Oman to the Holy Lands. Vast camel caravans carried thousands of tonnes of frankincense over tribal lands - known today as Oman, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Israel and Palestine. Following the trail across these seven nations, Kate finds modernity coexisting with ancient traditions as she discovers what it means to be a Western woman in Arabia.\n\nPart 3: Egypt\nKate Humble crosses the Red Sea from Saudi Arabia to Egypt following the frankincense trail of the Pharaohs. Travelling the length of the Nile, Kate enters Karnack, the world's largest religious site. She looks at the mummy of the once beautiful Queen of the Pharaohs, reveals the death rituals of the Pharaohs in the vast tomb of the Pyramids of Giza, jostles with thousands of ecstatic Christians, and in an extraordinary ceremony in the Sinai desert is cleansed of evil spirits.\n\nBBC Site &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00mfcf9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00mfcf9&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 4\nPart Size: 1.71 GB\nSource: HDTV\n\nXvid and SRT available at MVGroup (forums[dot]mvgroup[dot]org)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dca4c8abc6b5de9442ff41d64ac9079a2629cd24","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Frankincense+Trail+3of4+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dca4c8abc6b5de9442ff41d64ac9079a2629cd24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,164,200,171,198,181,222,148,66,255,65,214,74,201,7,154,38,41,205,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
