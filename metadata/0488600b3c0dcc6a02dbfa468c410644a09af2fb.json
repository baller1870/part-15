The series was later collected into an oversized graphic novel.\n\nThe storyline of Bucky O'Hare follows a parallel universe (the aniverse), where a war is ongoing between the slightly inept United Animals Federation (run by mammals) and the sinister Toad Empire. The Toad Empire is led by a vast computer system known as KOMPLEX, which has brainwashed the toad population.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0488600b3c0dcc6a02dbfa468c410644a09af2fb","amp;dn":"Bucky+O%27Hare+%231-5+%2B+GN+%281991-1992%29+%5BContinuity%5D+%28Requested%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0488600b3c0dcc6a02dbfa468c410644a09af2fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,136,96,11,60,13,204,106,2,219,250,70,140,65,6,68,160,154,242,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
