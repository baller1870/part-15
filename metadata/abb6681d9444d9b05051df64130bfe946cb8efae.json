On a cool, crisp summer night, with the Texas stars shining down like rattlesnake eyes, movie-goers for the All-Night Horror Show are trapped in the drive-in by a demonic-looking comet. Then the fun begins. If the movie-goers try to leave, their bodies dissolve into goo. Cowboys are reduced to tears. Lovers quarrel. Bikini-clad women let their stomachs' sag, having lost the ambition to hold them in. The world outside the six monstrous screens fades to black while the movie-goers spiral into base humanity, resorting to fighting, murdering, crucifying, and cannibalizing to survive. Part dark comedy part horror show, Lansdale's cult Drive-In  books are as shocking and entertaining today as they were 20 years ago.\n\nJoe R. Lansdale is the winner of the British Fantasy Award, the American Horror Award. the Edgar Award, and six Bram Stoker Awards. He lives in Nacogdoches, Texas.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abb6681d9444d9b05051df64130bfe946cb8efae","amp;dn":"Joe+R.+Lansdale+-+The+Drive-In+Trilogy+%26+Others","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abb6681d9444d9b05051df64130bfe946cb8efae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,182,104,29,148,68,217,176,80,81,223,100,19,11,254,148,108,184,239,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
