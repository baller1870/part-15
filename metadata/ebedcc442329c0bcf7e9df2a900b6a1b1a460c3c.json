Originally formed in 1983, the group is still active, though only the guitarist Steve Blaze remains from the original line-up.\nBiography\n\nThe classic line-up came together when former Stiff members, Ron Taylor (lead vocals) and Jon Ster (rhythm guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), teamed up with Lillian Axe members Steve Blaze (lead guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), Rob Stratton (bass guitar, and Danny King (drums) in 1987. The band caught the attention of Ratt's management which led to a record deal with MCA and Ratt's Robbin Crosby producing the band's first album, Lillian Axe. However, neither this nor the 1989 follow-up, Love + War, produced by Tony Platt, met commercial expectations and the group was quickly dropped. A compilation of both MCA albums, (1987-1989) Out of the Darkness - Into the Light, was released in 1991.\n\nOriginally released in 1999 and now much sought after, LILLIAN AXE's &quot;Fields Of Yesterday&quot; LP will be reissued with two bonus tracks on December 10 as part of Z Records' 10th anniversary celebrations. The track listing is as follows:\n\n01. Death Valley Daze\n02. Do It\n03. Twilight In Hell\n04. For Crying Out Loud\n05. The Last Time\n06. Calm Before The Storm\n07. Pulling The Rats Out\n08.
