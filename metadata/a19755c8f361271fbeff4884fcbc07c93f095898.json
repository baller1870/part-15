For the\nfirst time, musicians could escape the confines of the three-minute pop\nsingle and express themselves as never before across the expanded artistic\ncanvas of the album. The LP allowed popular music become an art form - from\nthe glorious artwork adorning gatefold sleeves, to the ideas and concepts\nthat bound the songs together, to the unforgettable music itself.\n\nBuilt on stratospheric sales of albums, these were the years when the\nmusic industry exploded to become bigger than Hollywood. From pop to rock,\nfrom country to soul, from jazz to punk, all of music embraced what\n'the album' could offer. But with the collapse of vinyl sales at the end\nof the 70s and the arrival of new technologies and formats, the golden era\nof the album couldn't last forever.\n\nWith contributions from Roger Taylor, Ray Manzarek, Noel Gallagher, Guy\nGarvey, Nile Rodgers, Grace Slick, Mike Oldfield, Slash and a host of\nothers, this is the story of When Albums Ruled the World\n\nDirector - Steve O'Hagan\nProducer - Steve O'Hagan\nExecutive Producer - Hamish Barbour\n\nFormat MPEG-4\nFile Size 835 MiB\nOverall Bit Rate 1 313 Kbps\nDuration 1h 28mn\nSample No\nSubtitles No\n\nContainer avc1\nVideo Codec Type x264\nVideo bitrate 1 200 Kbps / 1 200 Kbps\nResolution 720 X 400 pixels\nAspect ratio(AR) 16:9\nQuality Factor(QF) 0.167\nFrame Rate 25.000 fps\nSource ME.lol\n\nAudio Codec AAC\nBitrate Mode Variable\nBitrate 160 Kbps\nSample Rate 48.0 KHz\nChannel Count 2 channels [Front: L R]\n\nRipped by....: oneanight (oan)\nPosted by....: oneanight (oan) on 10th of February 2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a19755c8f361271fbeff4884fcbc07c93f095898","amp;dn":"BBC+-+When+Albums+Ruled+the+World+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a19755c8f361271fbeff4884fcbc07c93f095898","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,151,85,200,243,97,39,31,190,255,72,132,252,188,7,201,63,9,88,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
