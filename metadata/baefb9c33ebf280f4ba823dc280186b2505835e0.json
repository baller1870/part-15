In ten concise and comprehensible chapters, the book provides unprecedented coverage of the operation, control, planning, and design of electric power systems. It also discusses:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢A framework for interdisciplinary research and education\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Modeling electricity markets\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Alternative economic criteria and proactive planning for transmission investment in deregulated power systems\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Payment cost minimization with demand bids and partial capacity cost compensations for day-ahead electricity auctions\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Dynamic oligopolistic competition in an electric power network and impacts of infrastructure disruptions\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Reliability in monopolies and duopolies\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Building an efficient, reliable, and sustainable power system\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Risk-based power system planning integrating social and economic direct and indirect costs\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Models for transmission expansion planning based on reconfiguration capacitor switching\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Next-generation optimization for electric power systems\n\nMost chapters end with a bibliography, closing remarks, conclusions, or future work. Economic Market Design and Planning for Electric Power Systems is an indispensable reference for policy-makers, executives and engineers of electric utilities, university faculty members, and graduate students and researchers in control theory, electric power systems, economics, and the social sciences.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baefb9c33ebf280f4ba823dc280186b2505835e0","amp;dn":"Economic+Market+Design+and+Planning+for+Electric+Power+Systems+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baefb9c33ebf280f4ba823dc280186b2505835e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,239,185,195,62,191,40,15,75,168,35,220,40,1,134,178,80,88,53,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
