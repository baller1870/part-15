Instead, she finds herself drawn into the controversialÃ¢â‚¬â€and dangerousÃ¢â‚¬â€fight for womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s suffrage. But her dream is compromised, and her heart divided, when her struggle for equal rights collides with unexpected love. \n\nRowena Buxton \n\nAfter yearning to no avail for a certain young pilot to fly back into her life, Rowena fears her chances for happiness have been jeopardized by recklessness and scandal. Burdened with guilt for bringing her sister Prudence to Summerset Abbey as a ladyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s maid while she herself led a life of privilege, Rowena hopes to one day make amends. But her desire to set things right is complicated by her passion for flight and a sudden engagement . . . to the wrong man. \n\nPrudence Tate \n\nRaised like a sister to Victoria and Rowena, then banished to the servantsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ quarters when their father passed away, Prudence has seen both sides of life, upstairs and down. But once the truth about her parentage was revealed, Prudence forged a new life for herself, married to a penniless veterinary student. Living in poverty in a shabby London flat, she wonders if sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s made a terrible mistakeÃ¢â‚¬â€ and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no turning back. . . . \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f450b0fc53424dac0a4c6743084c46286ee8e92f","amp;dn":"T.J.+Brown+Summerset+Abbey+A+Bloom+in+Winter+%28Book+02%29+%28mobi+epu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f450b0fc53424dac0a4c6743084c46286ee8e92f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,80,176,252,83,66,77,172,10,76,103,67,8,76,70,40,110,232,233,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
