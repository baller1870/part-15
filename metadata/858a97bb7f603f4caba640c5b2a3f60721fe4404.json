R. Hergenhahn (Author)\n\nHardcover: 752 pages\nPublisher: Wadsworth Publishing; 6 edition (March 11, 2008)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0495506214\nISBN-13: 978-0495506218\n\nDreams puzzled early man, Greek philosophers spun elaborate theories to explain human memory and perception, Descartes postulated that the brain was filled with &quot;animal spirits,&quot; and psychology was officially deemed a &quot;science&quot; in the 19th century. In this Fifth Edition, B.R. Hergenhahn demonstrates that most of the concerns of contemporary psychologists are manifestations of themes that have been part of psychology for hundreds-or even thousands-of years. The book's numerous photographs and pedagogical devices, along with its biographical material on key figures in psychology, will engage you and facilitate your understanding of each chapter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:858a97bb7f603f4caba640c5b2a3f60721fe4404","amp;dn":"An+Introduction+to+the+History+of+Psychology+%286e%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"858a97bb7f603f4caba640c5b2a3f60721fe4404","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,138,151,187,127,96,63,76,171,166,64,197,178,163,246,7,33,254,68,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
