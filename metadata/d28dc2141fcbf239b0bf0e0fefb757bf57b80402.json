Now when it comes to piano versions of this work, I love Gould and Tureck's as much as the next guy, but you really must hear this version; it is about as good as you can possibly imagine.\n\nPlease enjoy.\n\nMP3 @ 320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d28dc2141fcbf239b0bf0e0fefb757bf57b80402","amp;dn":"Bach%2C+JS+-+Goldberg+Variations+-+Schiff","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d28dc2141fcbf239b0bf0e0fefb757bf57b80402","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,141,194,20,31,203,242,57,176,191,14,15,239,183,87,191,87,184,4,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
