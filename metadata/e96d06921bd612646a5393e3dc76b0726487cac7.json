The pill-popping, strip-bar-ogling, beer-guzzling Texas combo takes Metallica's speed-metal cues to new heights of brutality and sacrilege. Fortunately, they're extremely good at what they do. The polyrhythmic complexity of Vinnie Paul's drumming in &quot;Psycho Holiday&quot; and guitarist &quot;Dimebag&quot; Darrell's breathtaking solo in &quot;Heresy&quot; are examples of state-of-the-art metal musicianship. Vocalist Phil Anselmo often sounds like Metallica's James Hetfield, but his brooding croon on &quot;Cemetery Gates&quot; and his falsetto screams on the blindingly fast &quot;Shattered&quot; are more like vintage Deep Purple. Released in 1990, Cowboys made Pantera one of metal's top draws during an era in which it was almost eclipsed by alternative rock. --James Rotondi\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Cowboys from hell                                    [04:06]\n02.Primal concrete sledge                               [02:13]\n03.Psycho holiday                                       [05:19]\n04.Heresy                                               [04:47]\n05.Cemetery gates                                       [07:03]\n06.Domination                                           [05:04]\n07.Shattered                                            [03:22]\n08.Clash with reality                                   [05:17]\n09.Medicine man                                         [05:15]\n10.Message in blood                                     [05:10]\n11.The sleep                                            [05:47]\n12.The art of shredding                                 [04:18]\n________\n57:41 min\n 95,1 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
