D. Q. Bach,&quot; which is actually the work of composer Peter Schickele. It is a parody of opera in general, and the title is a play on two operas by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: The Abduction from the Seraglio and The Marriage of Figaro.\n\nSchickele was commissioned to &quot;discover&quot; this opera by the Minnesota Opera, where the piece premiered on April 27 and 28, 1984.[1] In addition to parodying Mozart, the music incorporates diverse influences and musical quotes, from traditional camp songs like &quot;Found a Peanut&quot; to popular songs like &quot;Macho Man&quot; by the Village People. The opera has been released on VHS and DVD.\n\nSynopsis of Scenes\n\n1. Introductory remarks by Prof. Peter Schickele\n2. Opening credits\n3.
