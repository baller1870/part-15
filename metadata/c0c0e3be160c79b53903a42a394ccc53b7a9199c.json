The story is well known from the excellent film version, but for those not familiar with the story, in brief summary - with much omitted - two spoilt aristocrats in pre-revolutionary France pass their days scheming and playing sexual politics. One, the Marquise de Merteuil, throws down a challenge to the Vicomte de Valmon. If he can corrupt the notoriously virtuous Madame de Tourvel, then the Marquise will sleep with him. He is successful, but then realises that he has fallen in love with his victim.\n\nA beautifully crafted piece.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0c0e3be160c79b53903a42a394ccc53b7a9199c","amp;dn":"Les+Liaisons+Dangereuses+-+Radio+Drama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0c0e3be160c79b53903a42a394ccc53b7a9199c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,192,227,190,22,12,121,181,57,3,164,42,57,76,204,83,183,169,25,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
