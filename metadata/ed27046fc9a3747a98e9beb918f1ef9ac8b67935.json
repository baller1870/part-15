He would find his way to Florida, open a head shop, and produce his first festivalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Miami Pop, featuring Jimi Hendrix, Frank Zappa, and othersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½then travel to Woodstock, where, after meeting Artie Kornfeld, his vision for a festival where folks could come and stay for a few days amid the rural beauty of upstate New York would become a reality. With Artie, new partners John Roberts and Joel Rosenman, and his handpicked crew, Lang booked talent, from Janis Joplin and the Who to the virtually unknown Santana and Crosby, Stills and Nash; won over agents, promoters, and townspeople; took on fleets of volunteers; built a festival site from the ground up; and, in the end, created the landmark cultural event that defined a generation.\n\nAbout the Author\n\n\nMichael Lang has produced festivals in East Berlin, the concert at the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Woodstock '94, and Woodstock '99, among many other events worldwide. He is the head of the Michael Lang Organization, producing live events; is a partner in Woodstock Ventures; and, with Sam Nappi, runs Harmony Entertainment, producing film and theater. He lives in upstate New York. \n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed27046fc9a3747a98e9beb918f1ef9ac8b67935","amp;dn":"The+Road+to+Woodstock%28epub%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed27046fc9a3747a98e9beb918f1ef9ac8b67935","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,39,4,111,201,163,116,122,152,233,190,185,24,241,239,154,200,182,121,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
