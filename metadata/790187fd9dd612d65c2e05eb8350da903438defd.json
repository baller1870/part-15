Starring everyone&amp;#039;s favorite animated characters and featuring the voices of Mickey Rooney and Georgia Engel, as well as songs performed by Carole King. The Care Bears Movie will dazzle and delight viewers of all ages. Way up high where the clouds and rainbows live, the Care Bears watch over the Earth and make sure everyone is kind and friendly to one another. So when they see an evil spirit trick a lonely boy into helping make people mean, the huggable heroes jump into action! They come to the rescue with the animals from the Forest of Feelings...but it&amp;#039;s going to take an awful lot of love to defeat the spirit&amp;#039;s powerful spell.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0284713/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0284713/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI hope you enjoy this classic.  Much better than all of the new animated tripe that is produced for children these days.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:790187fd9dd612d65c2e05eb8350da903438defd","amp;dn":"The+Care+Bears+%281985%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"790187fd9dd612d65c2e05eb8350da903438defd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,1,135,253,157,214,18,214,92,46,5,235,131,80,218,144,52,56,222,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
