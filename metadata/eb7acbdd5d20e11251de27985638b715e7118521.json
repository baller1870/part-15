Here is my list of the Top 100 Rap songs made between approx 1990 - 2008.  \n\nPLEASE READ BEFORE YOU BITCH:  This top 100 list is a little peculiar as it includes only &quot;non-old school&quot; songs.  I will have a separate torrent called &quot;TOP 100 OLD SCHOOL RAP SONGS&quot; soon, which will include your N.W.A, Run DMC, old school snoop dogg &amp; dr. dre, gang starr, geto boys, etc.  Also, songs like &quot;Gin and Juice,&quot; while having been made after 1990, will nevertheless be included in the old school torrent because it just sounds more old school to me.  This collection is unique because I think all of these songs are excellent, and some of them are kinda off the beaten path from &quot;mainstream rap&quot; which I despise.  You know, your &quot;lil' wayne's and TI's and such, I just can't stand the shit.  If you see songs you haven't heard, check 'em out.  Also, this list is also unique in that it features 1 or 2 songs that aren't anywhere on the Pirate Bay currently, including the song &quot;My Projects&quot; by Coo Coo Cal.  Love that song.\n\nThis is my 4rd list of the TOP 100 lists of all my different genres of music, and I'll have the rest posted shortly.  If you would like to see the others, here they are:  \n\n&quot;TOP 100 ALTERNATIVE ROCK SONGS&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4917391/TOP_100_ALTERNATIVE_ROCK_SONGS&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4917391/TOP_100_ALTERNATIVE_ROCK_SONGS&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&quot;TOP 100 R&amp;B SONGS (1990-2008)&quot; &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4669434/TOP_100_R_amp_B_SONGS_(1990-2008)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4669434/TOP_100_R_amp_B_SONGS_(1990-2008)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&quot;TOP 100 POP SONGS (1990-2008)&quot; &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4638355/TOP_100_POP_SONGS_(1990-2008)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4638355/TOP_100_POP_SONGS_(1990-2008)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&quot;TOP 100 DANCE SONGS (1970-2008)&quot; &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4665019/TOP_100_DANCE_SONGS_(1970-2008)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4665019/TOP_100_DANCE_SONGS_(1970-2008)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&quot;Classical Music Top 100&quot;   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3914124/Classical_Music_Top_100&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3914124/Classical_Music_Top_100&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&quot;100 Top Reggae Songs&quot;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4696579/100_Top_Reggae_Songs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4696579/100_Top_Reggae_Songs&lt;/a&gt;\n\n(The classical and reggae are not my uploads...thanks to the original uploaders)\n\nFeel free to leave comments for me below.  All three of my previous torrents have been very popular, so I'm hoping this one will be as well.
