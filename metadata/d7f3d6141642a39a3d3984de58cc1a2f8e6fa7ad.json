It is a buoyant collection of pop-fueled feel-good anthems and dance-floor clarion calls that bumps everything from electro-pop (the club-banging first single &quot;Fire Burning&quot;) to rock (&quot;Shoulda Let U Go&quot; featuring Good Charlotte) and from reggae (the breezy &quot;Island Queen&quot;), to R&amp;B (&quot;Wrap U Around Me&quot;). The production is courtesy of a host of top-notch producers, including J.R. Rotem (who produced Kingston's debut), RedOne (Lady Gaga), Wyclef Jean (who also contributes vocals on &quot;Ice Cream Girl&quot;), Detail (Akon), Lucas Secon (Jordin Sparks), and The Smeezingtons (Flo Rida). &quot;Fire Burning,&quot; the singer-songwriter's first single off the new album, entered into the top 5 at rhythm and top 10 at pop radio and was certified platinum by the RIAA in just 10 weeks. In addition to its ascent up the charts, streaming of &quot;Fire Burning&quot; reached over 13 million in just 2 months while the video for &quot;Fire Burning&quot; was the #1 most played video on MTV and Fuse for the month of July.\n\nTracks:\n\n01  Welcome To Tomorrow\n02  War\n03  Fire Burning\n04  My Girlfriend\n05  Face Drop\n06  Magical\n07  Island Queen\n08  Tomorrow\n09  Twist Ya Around\n10  Wrap U Around Me\n11  Shoulda Let U Go [Ft.
