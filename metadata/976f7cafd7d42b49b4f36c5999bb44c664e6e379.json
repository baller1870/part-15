The 1978 release of Caravan to Midnight was in a different style from the rest of his earlier work, symbolising a change in direction for him. &quot;I am spending much more time and energy and effort on writing and arranging the material,&quot; he said at the time, adding &quot;I think music today is suffering greatly from a cleanness. It&amp;#039;s too set, too pat, too clever, there&amp;#039;s not enough spontaneity.&quot;\n\nIn the early 1980&amp;#039;s, Trower teamed up with former Cream bassist Jack Bruce and his previous drummer Lordan for two incarnations, BLT and Truce respectively.\n\n01.Lady Love\n02.The Ring\n03.Day Of The Eagle\n04.Bridge Of Sighs\n05.Jack And Jill\n06.Too Rolling Stoned\n07.The Shout\n08.Hannah\n09.Daydream\n10.Victims Of The Fury\n11.Madhouse\n12.Little Bit Of Sympathy\n13.Messin&amp;#039; The Blues\n14.Rock Me Baby\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:976f7cafd7d42b49b4f36c5999bb44c664e6e379","amp;dn":"Robin+Trower+-+Hammond+Civic+Centre%2C+In+-+80-04-11+%28fixed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"976f7cafd7d42b49b4f36c5999bb44c664e6e379","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,111,124,175,215,212,43,73,180,243,108,89,153,187,68,198,100,230,227,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
