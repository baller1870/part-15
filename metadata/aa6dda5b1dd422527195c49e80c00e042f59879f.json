The effect is disturbing. The camera shoots familiar urban scenes, without a soul in sight: streets empty, buildings empty, yet everywhere there is evidence of recent life and activity. At the end of the film we learn what has happened. \n\n 23 Skidoo is a 1964 short experimental black and white film by Julian Biggs, produced by the National Film Board of Canada. Its central images are &quot;eerie&quot; and &quot;disturbing&quot; scenes of downtown Montreal devoid of people.\n\n In 1965 the film was nominated for a BAFTA Award for &quot;Best Short Film&quot;, and was also nominated for a UN Award. It won &quot;Special Mention&quot; in the international competition at the Cracow Film Festival that year.\n\n director:        Julian Biggs\n\n year:            1965\n\n AKAs:            -\n\n                                  :subtitles:\n\nThe film has no dialogue, only music.\n\n                                  :extras:\n\nNone\n\n                                  :screenshots: \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm31/diallelus/new%20new%20album/23SkidooJulianBiggs1965SCENIC00758910-22-47_zps5cb2c7d2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm31/diallelus/new%20new%20album/23SkidooJulianBiggs1965SCENIC00758910-22-47_zps5cb2c7d2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm31/diallelus/new%20new%20album/23SkidooJulianBiggs1965SCENIC01110310-23-00_zpsdd5b9948.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm31/diallelus/new%20new%20album/23SkidooJulianBiggs1965SCENIC01110310-23-00_zpsdd5b9948.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm31/diallelus/new%20new%20album/23SkidooJulianBiggs1965SCENIC00276310-23-21_zps377cfd52.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm31/diallelus/new%20new%20album/23SkidooJulianBiggs1965SCENIC00276310-23-21_zps377cfd52.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm31/diallelus/new%20new%20album/23SkidooJulianBiggs1965SCENIC00903410-22-54_zps77a5a451.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm31/diallelus/new%20new%20album/23SkidooJulianBiggs1965SCENIC00903410-22-54_zps77a5a451.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n                                  :notes:\n\nThanks to god @ SMz for (ripping? and) uploading the flick, thanks to Caska @ SMz for reuploading it once it was dead, and thanks to diallelus @ KG for uploding it there.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa6dda5b1dd422527195c49e80c00e042f59879f","amp;dn":"23+Skidoo+%5B1965%5D+%5BShort%2C+Experimental%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa6dda5b1dd422527195c49e80c00e042f59879f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,109,218,91,29,212,34,82,113,149,196,158,128,192,14,4,47,89,135,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
