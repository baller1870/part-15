All four members sang and played their own instruments, and the group's early music paid tribute to '60s pop/rock and West Coast neo-folk. Later, they traded their garage band roots for a slick, heavily produced pop sound that turned them into one of the most successful chart groups of either gender during the 1980s.\n\nIn the beginning, the Bangles pitched their harmonized voices atop a foundation of '60s-based guitar rock, and were fond of covering songs by Big Star, the Merry Go Round and Love. Sisters Debbi and Vicki Peterson -- on drums and guitar, respectively -- founded the group alongside singer/guitarist Susanna Hoffs, with bassist Annette Zilinskas joining shortly thereafter. Looking to make a name for themselves, the scruffy girl group self-released a debut single, 1981's &quot;Getting Out of Hand,&quot; which sounded like a lost song by the Mamas &amp; the Papas. A loose, four-song EP on the IRS label followed, as did a contract with Columbia Records. The Bangles' studio debut, All Over the Place was produced by David Kahne and released in 1984, once the band had been given an all-over cleanup. Although Zilinskas had left the group by this time (she later resurfaced with Blood on the Saddle), former Runaway Michael Steele was added in her place.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nSource:\t\t\tWeb\nGenre:\t\t\tPop\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Hero Takes A Fall\n02.Going Down To Liverpool\n03.Manic Monday\n04.If She Knew What She Wants\n05.Walk Like An Egyptian\n06.Walking Down Your Street\n07.Following\n08.Hazy Shade Of Winter\n09.In Your Room\n10.Eternal Flame\n11.Be With You\n12.I'll Set You Free\n13.Everything I Wanted\n14.Where Were You When I Needed You\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcb565a59664e8ce8a940d2540a21b50ea2604e5","amp;dn":"Bangles+-+Greatest+Hits+%281990%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcb565a59664e8ce8a940d2540a21b50ea2604e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,181,101,165,150,100,232,206,138,148,13,37,64,162,27,80,234,38,4,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
