However, in order to operate as an efficient energy generating system, the SOFC requires an appropriate control system which in turn requires a detailed modelling of process dynamics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bc977f7fb2a212db88f0727dc881b6b4bca29eb","amp;dn":"Dynamic+Modeling+and+Predictive+Control+in+Solid+Oxide+Fuel+Cell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bc977f7fb2a212db88f0727dc881b6b4bca29eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,201,119,247,251,42,33,45,184,143,7,39,220,136,27,107,75,202,41,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
