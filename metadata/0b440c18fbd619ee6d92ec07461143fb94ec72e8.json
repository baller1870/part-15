I decided to post this under FLAC even though\nmost of the tracks are Mp3. Why? Because it wouldn't let me post \nin the MUSIC category as I did with Volume 1 earlier.  However...\n\n\n....I also included 6 tracks in M4a Apple Lossless format of \nsuccessful singles released before Elton John's first LP album \n&quot;Empty Sky&quot; and a few of those were included on the CD re-release\nof that album decades later.  The others are from a 1992 Rare Tracks CD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b440c18fbd619ee6d92ec07461143fb94ec72e8","amp;dn":"ELTON+JOHN+%2F+Dick+James+Demos+--+Vol.+3+plus+lossless+singles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b440c18fbd619ee6d92ec07461143fb94ec72e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,68,12,24,251,214,25,238,109,146,236,7,70,17,67,251,148,236,114,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
