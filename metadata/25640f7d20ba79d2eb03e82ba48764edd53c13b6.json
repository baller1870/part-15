A hilarious, warm and intimate journey of one man, considered an expert in his country, who travels to a distant land to help people that don't seem to want his help. Lost in Moscow, lost in his mission, lost in translation, Phil tries to connect to his Russian colleagues but runs into unique characters and situations that conspire to drive him insane. The movie is a true international adventure, a genuine 'fish out of water' comedy that could only exist in real life. \n\n\n\nRelease___: Exporting.Raymond.2010.1080p.BluRay.x264-HD4U\nDate______: 27.07.2011\nRes_______: 1920x1080\nBitrate___: 9504kbps @ 23.976 fps\nAudio_____: English DTS 1510kbps 6ch\nSubtitles_: English, Russian","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25640f7d20ba79d2eb03e82ba48764edd53c13b6","amp;dn":"Exporting.Raymond.2010.1080p.BluRay.x264-HD4U","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25640f7d20ba79d2eb03e82ba48764edd53c13b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,100,15,125,32,186,121,210,235,3,232,43,164,135,100,237,213,60,19,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
