On the heels of Volume 4, The Wilderness, all four titles will be released in a special package with a 50 page booklet and a fifth disc of previously unreleased material.Timmins continues, &quot;When we were recording The Nomad Series we approached each album as a separate unit, each with its own specific theme or concept. Because we were recording and releasing so much music over so short a period of time, we felt that it was important to keep each album as lean and focused as possible. So at the end of mixing each album we looked at all of the songs that we had finished and decided what didn't work in a final album sequence; or didn't fit the overall concept of the album; what songs were best left off in order to make the whole stronger.It's not always an easy decision because each member of the band usually has a favorite or two that ends up on the list of songs to be left off. It's always hard letting go. Here are most of those orphaned songs put together for the first time on a disc...because four albums in eighteen months are just not enough.The first volume of the series, Renmin Park, released in 2010, was inspired by Michael Timmins' two-month stay in China with his family in '08 and was called &quot;their most ambitious yet&quot; by The Boston Herald. Demons (2011), the second in the series, is a collection of songs by the late Vic Chesnutt which Canada's National Post called &quot;...a celebration of both the Junkies and Chesnutt and one of the year's bestalbums.&quot; Volume 3, Sing In My Meadow (2011) was hailed by Metromix as, &quot;showing yet another side of one of the most versatile, underrated bands of the last 25 years.&quot; Michael sums up the band's motivation for taking on such a massive project quite simply. &quot;The main reason for wanting to do it,&quot; he says, &quot;is that, as we steamed through our twentyfifth year, we felt that we had the energy and inspiration to pull it off.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c02330523b6d5d69da293c8e56ba7f20022ce163","amp;dn":"The+Cowboy+Junkies+-+The+Nomad+Series+%5Bflac%5D+2012+Boxset","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c02330523b6d5d69da293c8e56ba7f20022ce163","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,35,48,82,59,109,93,105,218,41,60,142,86,186,127,32,2,44,225,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
