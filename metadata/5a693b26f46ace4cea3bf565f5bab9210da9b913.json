The competition begins with uShip, the world's largest online auction house for independent truckers. Every day, thousands of shipments are put up for auction. The battle is fierce as the movers have only minutes to bid, and the lowest bidder gets the load. From oversized loads and bulky packages to the truly bizarre, these shippers will haul anything if the price is right. The high-stakes race is on as they set out to deliver the loads in time, and any setback can cost big bucks.\n\n\n\n\n9)  Baja or Bust \nMarc is headed to Mexico when he wins an auction to ship a $100,000 Baja 1000 Trophy Truck. Leaving from Colorado, Marc must protect his precious cargo, and make sure it arrives without delay in time for the start of the famous race. But when he gets lost on the small back roads in Tijuana, Marc must get resourceful or risk putting the race team, and his career, in last place. Scott and Susie take their boat hauling knowledge to a whole new level when they transport a wooden pirate ship across the southwest. But as they put the miles behind them, the fragile pirate ship gets more and more difficult to keep tied down.\n\n10)  May the Ship be with You \nRoy lands the shipment of his dreams when he gets to haul some large one-of-a-kind props from his favourite sci-fi movie. But when he is cut-off by another trucker on the highway, he's afraid it may have damaged these priceless movie artifacts. Jennifer outbids fellow rookie, Jarrett, for a shipment of 20 peacocks headed to Arizona. With the exotic birds confined to small boxes for transport, she must cover nearly two thousand miles in three days, otherwise Jennifer risks killing the fowl from the stress of travelling.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img194.imageshack.us/img194/972/qd2z.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img194.imageshack.us/img194/972/qd2z.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img600.imageshack.us/img600/2961/cf6v.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img600.imageshack.us/img600/2961/cf6v.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img541.imageshack.us/img541/3715/roj3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img541.imageshack.us/img541/3715/roj3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/9871/zagu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/9871/zagu.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/174/2fla.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/174/2fla.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/1090/hnxk.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/1090/hnxk.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img507.imageshack.us/img507/1446/5xxx.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img507.imageshack.us/img507/1446/5xxx.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/5030/l0yc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/5030/l0yc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img197.imageshack.us/img197/8198/ddf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img197.imageshack.us/img197/8198/ddf.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;a2eacbc5cae2ee918c92&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 2145 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 Kbps CBR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * Run-Time: 22mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 10\n * Part Size: average 323 MB\n * Container: mp4\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/print.php?ID=58928&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/print.php?ID=58928&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a693b26f46ace4cea3bf565f5bab9210da9b913","amp;dn":"Shipping+Wars+Season+1+09of10+Baja+or+Bust+DVDRip+x264+AAC+MVGro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a693b26f46ace4cea3bf565f5bab9210da9b913","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,105,59,38,244,106,206,76,234,59,245,101,245,186,185,33,13,169,185,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
