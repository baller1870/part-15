Clinton HeylinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s revelatory biography, E Street \n\nShuffle, chronicles the evolution and influence of SpringsteenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s E Street Band as they rose from blue-collar New Jersey \n\nto the heights of rock stardom. The bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s playersÃ¢â‚¬â€most notably saxophonist Clarence Ã¢â‚¬Å“Big ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Clemons, guitarist \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“LittleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Stevie Van Zandt, and drummer Max WeinbergÃ¢â‚¬â€became SpringsteenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s comrades in concert, helping him find the \n\nelusive sound and sonic punch that highlighted The BossÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most creative period, including Darkness on the Edge of Town, \n\nBorn to Run, and Born in the USA. Fans will also learn another side of Springsteen, one punctuated with his clashes with \n\nstudio executives seeking a commercially viable, radio-friendly album, and  his  temporary disbanding of the E Street \n\nBand to pursue projects like the eerie acoustic of Nebraska. Coinciding with the forteith anniversary of SpringsteenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s \n\ndebut album, Greetings from Asbury Park, drawing on interviews and access to new recordings and shows, Heylin paints a \n\nbold picture of The Boss.\n\nFollow me on twitter: @livhre\nRequest books on twitter: @livhre\nPlease seed and rate the torrents I upload. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b013137501f11ff1b74d41614c3e17ea0380ef12","amp;dn":"E+Street+Shuffle+-+The+Glory+Days+of+Bruce+Springsteen+and+the+E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b013137501f11ff1b74d41614c3e17ea0380ef12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,19,19,117,1,241,31,241,183,77,65,97,76,62,23,234,3,128,239,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
