Even though de Mello gave\ninnumberable workshops around the world, he never allowed any of his talks to be recorded. In 1986 at Fordham University in New York, he allowed this conference to be videotaped by a professional television company. On these tapes, you will hear Tony de Mello at his best, just himself, completely at home with a responsive audience. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFr. Anthony de Mello, S.J. (1931?1987) was a Jesuit priest and psychotherapist who became widely known for his books on spirituality. He hosted many spiritual retreats and was considered by some a gifted public speaker. Father de Mello was born in Santa Cruz, a suburb of Mumbai in India. He traveled to many countries to study and later to teach, most notably Spain and the United States.\n\nDe Mello established a prayer center in India. He died suddenly in 1987. His works are still in print and additional writings were published after his death.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86f92002664ea43261d8423e2032562688bb4aa2","amp;dn":"Anthony+Demello+-+Wake+Up+To+Life+-+NY86","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86f92002664ea43261d8423e2032562688bb4aa2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,249,32,2,102,78,164,50,97,216,66,62,32,50,86,38,136,187,74,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
