This earned it the nickname Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Curve Bender.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nWaves and Abbey Road Studios have faithfully recreated the unique magic of the RS56, using \nadvanced circuit modeling techniques based on the original schematics. Like its hardware pre-\ndecessor, the Waves: Abbey Road RS56 passive EQ plugin features three bands with four \nselectable center frequencies for each and six different filter types, plus independent or linked \ncontrol over the left and right channels. The result is an extraordinary equalizer that is as \neffective today as it was when it was created over half a century ago.\n\nFeatures\n\n    Based on the legendary RS56 Universal Tone Control passive EQ\n    Three bands with four selectable center frequencies for each\n    Six different filter types\n    Independent or linkable left/right controls\n    Developed in association with Abbey Road Studios\n\nINFO @ http://www.waves.com/content.aspx?id=12265\n\n\n                ____________________________________________________\n\n\n\nTHIS IS THE OS X VERSION ONLY\n\n\n                ____________________________________________________\n\n\n\nInstructions:\n\n\n\n   Ã‚Â³ - uninstall previous versions                                          Ã‚Â³ \n   Ã‚Â³ - unpack and install with installer                                    Ã‚Â³  \n   Ã‚Â³ - goto /Applications/Waves/Waveshells                                  Ã‚Â³ \n   Ã‚Â³ - run Waves AU Reg Utility 9.2.app                                     Ã‚Â³ \n   Ã‚Â³ - enjoy!                                                               \n\n\n                ____________________________________________________\n\nSupport the software creators !\n\n________________\n\nPS: Help me to seed please, I have a 1 mbps bandwidth and this is the only release of Waves RS56 Passive EQ Plugin v9.2.16.12 MAC OSX-Xdb on The Pirate Bay !\nPost feedback please as i'm a new uploader ! :)\n\n________________\n\nThanks to Xdb.\nABOD.
