This disc was always my favourite from that series; it was released in 1989. Here we find 20th century chamber music that is tuneful and beautiful.\n\nThe disc contains the following pieces and the following musicians:\n\n1) Sextet for piano, flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon and horn\n2) Sonata for clarinet and piano\n3) Sonata for flute and piano\n4) Sonata for oboe and piano\n5) Trio for piano, oboe and bassoon\n\nPascal Roge - Piano\nPatrick Gallois - Flute\nMaurice Bourgue - Oboe\nMichel Portal - Clarinet\nAmaury Wallez - Bassoon\nAndre Cazalet - Horn\n\nPlease enjoy.\n\nMP3 @ 320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39221091022d68dd3bbfbc36e98bbf6563f9e4fd","amp;dn":"Poulenc+-+Piano+and+Wind+Chamber+Music+-+Rose%2C+etc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39221091022d68dd3bbfbc36e98bbf6563f9e4fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,34,16,145,2,45,104,221,59,191,188,54,233,139,191,101,99,249,228,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
