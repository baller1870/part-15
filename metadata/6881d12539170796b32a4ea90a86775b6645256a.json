After his best friend Bodhi is ruthlessly derezzed by Clu's army, Beck seeks justice for his lost friend and launches a crusade against the regime. His rebellion captures the attention of Tron, the greatest warrior The Grid has ever known, who sees the potential in Beck and trains him to be his successor. Labeled with the moniker of The Renegade, Beck sparks a revolution to fight for the freedom of The Grid.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6881d12539170796b32a4ea90a86775b6645256a","amp;dn":"Tron+Uprising+-+0x01+-+Beck%27s+Beginning+720p+5.1+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6881d12539170796b32a4ea90a86775b6645256a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,129,209,37,57,23,7,150,179,42,78,169,10,134,119,91,102,69,37,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
