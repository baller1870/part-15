Evolutionary computation which are able to handle tasks such as control of various chaotic systems and synthesis of their structure are explored, while deterministic chaos is investigated as a behavioral part of evolutionary algorithms.\n\n This book is targeted for a number of audiences. Firstly, it will be an instructional material for senior undergraduate and entry-point graduate students in computer science, physics, applied mathematics, and engineering, who are working in the area of deterministic chaos and evolutionary algorithms. Secondly, researchers who desire to know how to apply evolutionary techniques on chaos control as well as researchers interested in the emergence of chaos in evolutionary algorithms will find this book a very useful tool and starting point. And finally, this book can be viewed as a resource handbook and material for practitioners who want to apply these methods that solve practical problems to their challenging applications.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25f9e6deeafbcf97a9298f3ea89a4315004834aa","amp;dn":"Evolutionary+Algorithms+and+Chaotic+Systems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25f9e6deeafbcf97a9298f3ea89a4315004834aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,249,230,222,234,251,207,151,169,41,143,62,168,154,67,21,0,72,52,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
