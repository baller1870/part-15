Both appear here. Conversely, a handful of standards get the unique Diamond vocal treatment - &quot;He ain't heavy, he's my brother&quot;, &quot;Mr Bojangles&quot; and even &quot;Morning has Broken&quot;. But let's not distract from the main purpose - track after track of some of the strongestmoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ songs of the late sixties and seventies which would grace anybody's music collection.\n\n\n\nDisc 01\n\n[01] Sweet Caroline\n[02] Song Sung Blue\n[03] Cracklin' Rosie\n[04] Love On The Rocks\n[05] Beautiful Noise\n[06] Forever In Blue Jeans\n[07] Hello Again\n[08] Red, Red Wine\n[09] Everybody's Talkin'\n[10] Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon\n[11] I'm A Believer\n[12] Heartlight\n[13] Up On The Roof\n[14] Desiree\n[15] If You Know What I Mean\n[16] Longfellow Serenade\n[17] Play Me\n[18] You Got To Me\n[19] I (Who Have Nothing) \n\n     Disc 01 - Play Time - 01h:05m:35s\n\n\n\nDisc 02\n\n[01] I Am...
