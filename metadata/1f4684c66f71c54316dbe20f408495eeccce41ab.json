Pitney is sometimes characterized (or dismissed) as a shallow teen idol-type prone to operatic ballads. It's true that some of his biggest hits -- &quot;Town Without Pity,&quot; &quot;Only Love Can Break a Heart,&quot; &quot;I'm Gonna Be Strong,&quot; &quot;It Hurts to Be in Love,&quot; and &quot;Twenty Four Hours From Tulsa&quot; -- are archetypes of adolescent or just-post-adolescent agony, characterized by longing and not a little self-pity.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gene-pitney-p5148/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gene-pitney-p5148/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Reviews:\n\n2 for 1\nAMG Review\nby Cub Koda\n\nTwo albums on one CD, this features straight-up reissues of Pitney's two Musicor albums with three bonus tracks tacked on at the end. Sings the Great Songs of Our Time is a U.K. retitle of Pitney's American Looking Through the Eyes of Love album and finds Pitney covering several old-time standards like &quot;Misty,&quot; &quot;Unchained Melody,&quot; and &quot;All the Way&quot; with various levels of success. The Nobody Needs Your Love album features the hit &quot;Backstage&quot; along with Randy Newman's title song. The three bonus tracks are both sides of his 1966 mid-charter, &quot;Princess in Rags&quot; and &quot;Amore Mio&quot; and the U.K. flip side of &quot;Backstage,&quot; &quot;In Love Again.&quot; Not essentially Pitney, but a nice set with its moments.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/sings-the-great-songs-of-our-time-nobody-needs-your-love-r258663&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/sings-the-great-songs-of-our-time-nobody-needs-your-love-r258663&lt;/a&gt;\n\n=========\n\nSings the Great Songs of Our Time\nPage at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/sings-the-great-songs-of-our-time-r46724&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/sings-the-great-songs-of-our-time-r46724&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000000PTV&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000000PTV&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
