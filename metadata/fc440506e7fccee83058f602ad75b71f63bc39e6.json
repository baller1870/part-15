Unfortunately, talent seems to have skipped a generation, and Harry is reduced to &quot;gumshoe&quot; work at a remote branch of the Crumb detective agency. Back at headquarters, Crumb executive Elliot Draison hatches an evil plan, which requires the inclusion of an incompotent detective. With Harry Crumb on the case, Draison thinks everything will run fine for him. Despite his best efforts, Crumb actually makes some headway in the case.\n\nRipped by myself from DVD, in DIVX format.\n\nSample file included in torrent","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc440506e7fccee83058f602ad75b71f63bc39e6","amp;dn":"Whos+Harry+Crumb+%281989%29+DIVX+English+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc440506e7fccee83058f602ad75b71f63bc39e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,68,5,6,231,252,206,232,48,88,246,2,173,117,183,31,99,188,57,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
