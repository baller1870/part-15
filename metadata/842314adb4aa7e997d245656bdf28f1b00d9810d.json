Fossils hold the key to discovering the mysteries of ancient life, and provide a tantalizing glimpse of worlds long gone. The Fossil Detectives are on a journey throughout the British Isles, piecing together the clues that unlock the secrets of Britain's extraordinary past. Fossil Detectives showcases Britain's amazing wealth of fossil remains, inspiring the explorer in all of us. Each packed episode is based in a different region of Britain, breathing life into the country's most spectacular fossil finds, and discovering how fossils are at the cutting edge of scientific research. So join Hermione Cockburn and a host of other top fossil loving celebrities including Sir David Attenborough and Blurs Alex James on a fossil adventure.\n\n\n1)  Central England \nAfter meeting David Attenborough, who recalls his early days as a fossil detective in central England, Hermione and the team investigate some of the world's most important fossil discoveries in the area. They look at the evidence that has revealed the world's smallest fossilised mystery body part, gain an insight into the iconic dinosaur Tyrannosuarus Rex and view a buried treasure which could change the way we look at ancient marine creatures.\n\n2)  London \nShe visits the London home of David Attenborough to view his private fossil collection and find out why fossils have held such a special place in his heart since his childhood. The fossil detective team also track down evidence of the capital's ancient past, a lost world where hippos were common. They take a trip to Kew Gardens to see living fossils - plants which existed in prehistoric times and still thrive today.\n\n3)  West and Wales \nThe team visits Wales to bring dinosaurs back to life using evolutionary robotics and we follow the intriguing story of the fossils at the Ford engine plant in Bridgend.\nOn the outskirts of Liverpool, Hermione follows in the footsteps of our ancestors to discover trace fossils of human beings which are still soft to the touch. Plus, why fossils were thought to be food for the dead, and the team come face to face with a prehistoric skeleton with a dark secret\n\n4)  North England \nThe team get a rare view of a new fossil discovery on the North East coast. Hermione abseils the cliffs of Yorkshire to find evidence of the ancient monsters that once lived there. John Lennon's link to fossils is investigated, and the truth behind the Victorians' favourite fossil in Whitby is revealed.\n\n5)  South West England \nIn the south-west of England, the team see Britain's best-preserved dinosaur, complete with crocodile teeth in its mouth and fossilised vomit in its throat, and discover why the Jurassic Coast is one of the most dynamic shorelines in the world. They meet a relative of the dinosaurs which is alive and well today and, at Lulworth Cove, former Blur bassist Alex James explains his childhood love of fossils.\n\n6)  East of England \nIn the east of England, the team go on a fossil hunting challenge on Hunstanton beach and find out how fossils can be discovered right on your doorstep. They discover the story behind the world's most complete and largest mammoth skeleton, uncovered at West Runton; the scientific answers revealed by the biggest fish that ever lived, discovered on the outskirts of Peterborough; and how fossils can reveal past climates.\n\n7)  Scotland \nIn Scotland, the team go fossil hunting in Loch Ness and track down prehistoric life throughout the country, some of it revealed though cutting-edge MRI scans never seen before. They discover how microfossils help us find fossil fuel and Hermione fishes for strange armoured creatures that date back hundreds of millions of years.\n\n8)  South of England \nThe team finds out why southern England is the best place to go dinosaur hunting in the UK, as they excavate their own dinosaur at a secret location on the Isle of Wight. They search for the iguanodon, the discovery that made scientists realise that dinosaurs existed, while Billy Bragg and his son Jack share their best fossil finds\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d39eb2babd939fe0fde3&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1568 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 30mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 8\n * Part Size: average 321 MB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Thanks to &quot;llamabert&quot;\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information \n * http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00d6mqy\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:842314adb4aa7e997d245656bdf28f1b00d9810d","amp;dn":"BBC.Fossil.Detectives.4of8.North.England.PDTV.x264.AAC..mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"842314adb4aa7e997d245656bdf28f1b00d9810d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,35,20,173,180,170,126,153,125,36,86,86,189,242,143,27,0,217,129,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
