Only this time, with the help of legendary producer Flood and a full band, and aided by the art, inspiration and (to be frank) dosh of old pal Damien Hirst, The Hours have created a bigger, bolder, better record. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll blow your ears off and blast your heart. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s that good. The album was mixed by Cenzo Townshend (Kaiser Chiefs, Snow Patrol, Blur, U2).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8cfb7dd2ce518e15a19cb5c16c4fbe60b0652ca","amp;dn":"The+Hours+-+See+The+Light+%5Bmp3-vbr-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8cfb7dd2ce518e15a19cb5c16c4fbe60b0652ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,207,183,221,44,229,24,225,90,25,203,92,22,196,251,230,11,6,82,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
