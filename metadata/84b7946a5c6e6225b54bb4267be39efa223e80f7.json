(Discworld II: Mortality Bytes! in North America) is the second graphic adventure game based on Terry Pratchett's series of fantasy novels set on the mythical Discworld. The game was developed by Perfect Entertainment and published by Psygnosis in 1996 on two CD-ROMs. It features hand-drawn environments and animations, full voice acting and a simple interface.\n\nIn Discworld II the player controls Rincewind the Wizzard [sic] (voiced by Eric Idle, as in the previous game) who has been burdened with the task of coercing Death out of his impromptu retirement and back into his regular duties. The plot borrows from a number of Discworld books, most notably Reaper Man, Moving Pictures and Lords and Ladies.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gamershell.com/static/screenshots/684/18147_full.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gamershell.com/static/screenshots/684/18147_full.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gamershell.com/static/screenshots/684/18146_full.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gamershell.com/static/screenshots/684/18146_full.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gamershell.com/static/screenshots/684/18149_full.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gamershell.com/static/screenshots/684/18149_full.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84b7946a5c6e6225b54bb4267be39efa223e80f7","amp;dn":"Discworld.2.Missing.Presumed-MTX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84b7946a5c6e6225b54bb4267be39efa223e80f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,183,148,106,92,110,98,37,181,75,180,38,123,227,158,250,34,62,128,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
