Covers of both are included, so you decide what to do.\n\nIf you are a jazzrock fan this is a definite must have!\n\nA lot of info is available at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gong_(band)\n\nBrought to you by TQMP. (The Quality Music Project)\n\nIn this project me and my fellow pirates share only quality items out of our CD collections in lossless FLAC and include covers, especially for those who like to burn and print and put it in a nice and shiny jewelcase. Well, you all know the drill :)\n\nRipped by Exact Audio Copy V0.99 from 01-23-2008, encoded to FLAC with 1024kb/s\nGet Your Free Copy of the EAC and FLAC suite at:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.exactaudiocopy.de/en/index.php/resources/download/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.exactaudiocopy.de/en/index.php/resources/download/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease feel free to join the TQMP project!\nThe &quot;rules&quot; are simple: Rip your CD (no 1980's cassettetapes or vinylrips please!) in lossless format AND include artwork. Include cue- and logfiles for the purists and the TQMP searchtag in your title, so it can easily be found. (Yes, on Google as well..)\n\nYou can find all TQMP uploads at: www.thepiratebay.se  (Simply use the TQMP searchtag :)\n\nContact: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;f4968691918e9d9ab4989d8291da9a98&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nGreetings to ya'all from the Breezin Dutchman! d:)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c76063deb9e1780cece47a7edc48b4c273254357","amp;dn":"Gong+-+Gazeuse%21+1977+%2B+Expresso+II+1978+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c76063deb9e1780cece47a7edc48b4c273254357","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,96,99,222,185,225,120,12,236,228,122,126,220,72,180,194,115,37,67,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
