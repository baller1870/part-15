And from the first chord of God Says No, you know you are in for a wild ride. &quot;Melt&quot; finds head Magnet Dave Wyndorf, in his &quot;world of pills&quot; wondering &quot;how the world should have cried on the day Jack Kirby died&quot;. The obvious first single, &quot;Heads Explode&quot;, rolls along with same mock mod-fervour as &quot;See You In Hell&quot; (from Powertrip) before detonating into absolute mayhem at the chorus. Throughout, Wyndorf plays themoreÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦ arch-devil&amp;#039;s advocate, switching between adulation and annihilation of his bitch/goddess foil (on tracks like &quot;Doomsday&quot; and &quot;Queen Of You&quot;). &quot;Gravity Well&quot; is as raw as it gets, bare bones blues that sounds like a version of Son House&amp;#039;s &quot;John The Revelator&quot; recorded on the wrong side of the tracks. And, as the high priest of all that he surveys, Wyndorf faces his own Judgment Day on the sin-soaked ramble of &quot;God Says No&quot;, before finally coming down on the side of the damned. Devotees will already know what to expect: tunes to make your head explode.\n\nEnjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fd06821e0992d7302f5621bfc5f67fcf2073a07","amp;dn":"Monster+Magnet+-+God+Says+No","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fd06821e0992d7302f5621bfc5f67fcf2073a07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,208,104,33,224,153,45,115,2,245,98,27,252,95,103,252,242,7,58,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
