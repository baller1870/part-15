The Enemy is Robert Douglas, banished because he will neither bow to the will of the ruling council nor use his sorcerous powers to overthrow the usurper King Selar. The Ally is Jenn, now returned to her family and learning to live the life of a noblewoman, whilst using her own powers secretly to help those disobeying the Guide's punitive new laws. The Angel of Darkness masquerades an Alderman, using his position close to the king to foment his own dastardly plans for Lusara. And the Enemy, the Ally and the Angel of Darkness must each face their own greatest weaknesses.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:324f9be722d96e1c5f7e5be25acfd48f3f076db7","amp;dn":"Voice+Of+The+Demon+%5BElita+Book+2%5D+-+Kate+Jacoby","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"324f9be722d96e1c5f7e5be25acfd48f3f076db7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,79,155,231,34,217,110,28,95,126,91,226,90,207,212,143,63,7,109,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
