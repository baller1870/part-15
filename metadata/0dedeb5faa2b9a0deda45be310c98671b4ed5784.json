I then discovered that some of the albums were shitrips, and a few tracks were corrupted. I downloaded and compared with another discography torrent (which seemed almost identical to the one I already had). &quot;Heroes&quot; was missing from the discographies, and &quot;Carolus Rex&quot; had a corrupt track. I found a good torrent for the &quot;Carolus Rex&quot; album, and found &quot;Heroes&quot; from another source. I still had no good rips to replace the shitrips with, so I went on a Google search and got the albums I needed from file hosts. However, those albums were all single FLAC (+ CUE) files, so I had to split them into separate tracks. One of the albums was in Monkey's Audio (APE + CUE), so I had to decompress that, using the official Monkey's Audio application, and then convert the WAV file to FLAC (and then split it).\r\n\r\nI also replaced some of the good rips, because I found better rips with more tracks.\r\n\r\nThe albums that I replaced (compared to the other discography torrents) are:\r\n\r\n* Primo Victoria (2005)\r\n* Attero Dominatus (2006)\r\n* Metalizer (2007)\r\n* The Art of War (2008)\r\n* Coat of Arms (2010)\r\n* Metalus Hammerus Rex (2012)\r\n* Carolus Rex (2012)\r\n\r\nSome other changes:\r\n\r\n* All albums have been re-tagged with MusicBrainz Picard.\r\n* ReplayGain has been added to all albums.\r\n* I deleted &quot;Fist for Fight&quot; as a stand-alone album (because it's included as a bonus disc to &quot;Metalizer Re-Armed&quot;).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI know, I know... I could've added the live albums. I could've waited a few days, and added the new album (&quot;The Last Stand&quot;). I don't even listen to metal, and I don't know why I'm doing this. But, here you go. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nPS: If you want the live albums, they're available here:\r\n \nhttp://losslessmusics.org/news/sabaton_discography_2005_2012/2016-03-26-10727","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dedeb5faa2b9a0deda45be310c98671b4ed5784","amp;dn":"Sabaton+discography_FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dedeb5faa2b9a0deda45be310c98671b4ed5784","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,237,235,95,170,43,154,13,237,164,91,227,16,201,134,113,180,237,87,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
