There are few kinds of music that is both relaxing yet stimulating and mood enhancing. It just makes me happy!!! I would think that music from heaven itself might be like this! Listen to this CD and you will feel better. I have never agreed with the critics. I have loved his music even when I was a teenager and used to watch this with my family and we all loved it and still do!!! This is great for dining, relaxing at home, driving, vacationing and all around. I would love to see a new weekly television show. If ABC won't do it, then fine go a satellite channel! If you look at all the varieties of music L.W. had on his show and the dancing for the audience, it was a huge undertaking, but he obviously loved it and graciously carried on to great success. I think L.W. led the world in a way making harmonious melodies from a mixed variety from country to classical. It is truly an amazing feat that with &quot;hard work&quot; and &quot;God's help&quot; as he attributed his success in his book it can be done. Next to Bob Hope, Lawrence Welk was Hollywood's top musical entertainer in earnings says the &quot;Current Biography&quot; report on him. In his words &quot;And now friends keep a song in your heart and have a wonderful, wonderful week.&quot;\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nLawrence Welk - 22 All Time Favorite Waltzes\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Lawrence Welk\nAlbum................: 22 All Time Favorite Waltzes\nGenre................: Easy Listening\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1987\n\nFLAC\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 57 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 264kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
