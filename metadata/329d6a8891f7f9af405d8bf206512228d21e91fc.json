This assumes that &quot;you&quot; are ne'er-do-well big-talker Quinn and explains-sort of-how you hooked up (not like that!) with a badass ex-cop (and current mama's boy) named Krunk, who would just as soon kill you as look at you, if not both.  By the way, the hot chick is now really hot-in the bad way-and this time she's probably going to tip you with a laser ax or a plasma grenade or something.  Try talking your way out of that one, spacehole!\n\nCreated totally on purpose by Zach Howard (Shaun of the Dead) and Sean Murphy (Scarecrow: Year One; Off Road), with screenwriter Reed Buccholz.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:329d6a8891f7f9af405d8bf206512228d21e91fc","amp;dn":"Outer+Orbit+%28Dark+Horse%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"329d6a8891f7f9af405d8bf206512228d21e91fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,157,106,136,145,247,249,175,64,93,139,242,6,81,34,40,210,30,145,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
