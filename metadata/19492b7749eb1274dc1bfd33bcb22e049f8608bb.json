It is also well-known as a triumph of engineering against the odds, as a huge workforce was assembled to work in extremely tough conditions. The line is home to some dramatic constructions, such as the Ribblehead Viaduct and Blea Moor Tunnel, and rises to the highest point on the British main line at 1,169 feet (356m) above sea level. The line endured and won a five-year battle against closure in the late 1980s, and has since remained a favourite with enthusiasts who come from far and wide to ride on the line every year.\n\nNow you can drive trains along this inspiring stretch of line, battling the gradients through the three peaks and admiring the views as you drive over (and sometimes beneath) this wonderful landscape. With modern and preserved locomotives to drive, there is something for everyone on the Settle-Carlisle.\n\nKey Features\nHighly detailed route from Settle, North Yorkshire to Carlisle, Cumbria including the Ribblehead Viaduct, Carlisle Station and all stations and landmarks along the line.\n\nClass 66 locomotive in EWS livery\nClass 37 locomotive in EWS livery\nClass 158 DMU\nLeander Jubilee Class 4-6-0 steam locomotive\nPreserved LMS 4F 0-6-0 steam locomotive\nRolling stock including HAA and HTA hoppers, PCA tankers and Crimson Mk1 coaches\nScenarios:\nLearning the Ropes Pt1 (Class 66 EWS)\nLearning the Ropes Pt2 (Class 66 EWS)\nLearning the Ropes Pt3 (Class 66 EWS)\nThe Final Run Pt1 (Class 158 DMU)\nThe Final Run Pt2 (Class 158 DMU)\nA Fair Return (Class 158 DMU)\nWaking Up the Neighbours (Class 37 EWS)\nLeft Behind (Class 66 EWS)\nMidwinter Rescue (Class 37 EWS)\nSettle Down (Class 158 DMU)\nAn Uphill Struggle (Class 37 EWS)\nTaking Stock (LMS Jubilee Ã¢â‚¬ËœLeanderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢)\nThe Ribble Run Around (preserved LMS 4F)\nPlus 3 free roams","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19492b7749eb1274dc1bfd33bcb22e049f8608bb","amp;dn":"RailWorks+3+-+Settle+to+Carlisle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19492b7749eb1274dc1bfd33bcb22e049f8608bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,73,43,119,73,235,18,116,220,27,253,51,188,178,46,4,159,134,8,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
