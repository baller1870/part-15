And for good reason, too. Duran Duran's reputation was built through music videos, which accentuated their fashion-model looks and glamorous sense of style. Without music videos, it's likely that their pop-funk -- described by the group as the Sex Pistols meets Chic -- would never have made them international pop stars. While Duran Duran did have sharper pop sensibilities than their new romantic contemporaries like Spandau Ballet and Ultravox, none of their peers exploited MTV and music video like the Birmingham-based quintet. Each video the group made was distinctive, incorporating a number of cinematic styles to showcase the band as either part of the jet-setting elite (&quot;Rio&quot;) or as worldly adventurers (&quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot;). While early videos like &quot;Girls on Film&quot; and &quot;The Chauffeur&quot; sparked controversy in England over their sexual content, their best-known clips were often based on hit contemporary movies. &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; uncannily recalled Raiders of the Lost Ark, while &quot;Union of the Snake&quot; and &quot;The Wild Boys&quot; brought to mind The Road Warrior. The clever videos helped make Duran Duran's rise to popularity remarkably swift. Between 1982 and 1984, they rocketed from underground British post-punk sensations to teen idols. But their fall from grace was equally fast. By the late '80s, the group's lineup had fragmented, and the remaining members had trouble landing hit singles. Nevertheless, the group pulled off a surprising, if short-lived, comeback in the early '90s as a sophisticated soft rock trio. \n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info\n\n\n01.All You Need Is Now\n02.Blame The Machines\n03.Being Followed\n04.Leave A Light On\n05.Safe (In The Heat Of The Moment)\n06.Girl Panic!\n07.A Diamond In The Mind\n08.The Man Who Stole A Leopard\n09.Other People's Lives\n10.Mediterranea\n11.Too Bad You're So Beautiful\n12.Runway Runaway\n13.Return To Now\n14.Before The Rain\n15.Networker Nation (Bonus Track)\n16.All You Need Is Now (Youth Kills Mix) (Bonus Track)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n               ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e14b17179809de6187e4278ff68f5798c612bdca","amp;dn":"Duran+Duran+-+All+You+Need+Is+Now+%5BDeluxe%5D+2011+CBR320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e14b17179809de6187e4278ff68f5798c612bdca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,75,23,23,152,9,222,97,135,228,39,143,246,143,87,152,198,18,189,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
