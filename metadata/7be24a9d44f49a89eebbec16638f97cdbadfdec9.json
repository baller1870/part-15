Convenient and portable, this guide provides enough information to allow trainees to perform the operations themselves under appropriate supervision.\n\nConcise surgical steps for each procedure are followed by detailed explanations. Clear diagrams and photographs demonstrate the important stages of each operation. SurgeonsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ tips bridge the gap between the theory and what actually works on the operating table. The book also includes an easy reference table of complications that should be discussed with the patient when obtaining consent.\n\nThe authors have used their wealth of experience to write a practical guide that that will give trainees the skills as well as the confidence they will need in the surgical arena.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7be24a9d44f49a89eebbec16638f97cdbadfdec9","amp;dn":"ENT+and+Head+and+Neck+Procedures+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7be24a9d44f49a89eebbec16638f97cdbadfdec9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,226,74,157,68,244,154,137,238,187,236,22,99,143,151,205,186,223,222,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
