There are &quot;No-CD&quot; patches for this game on the net, but I would bother with them, they cause more harm than good, this works perfectly on Windows 7 32bit, \nI have not tested this on 64bit.\n\n4) This game is Xbox360 gamepad compatible, but not all buttons are mapped; to use Xbox360 gamepad with better mapped keybindings, use xpadder, and load my \n&quot;Rogue Squadron 3D (Xbox360)&quot; profile from the &quot;Game Profiles&quot; folder\n\n5) Start the game, create a profile, setup your prefered graphics config and off you go.\n\n6) Enjoy\n\nWiki:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Rogue_Squadron&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Rogue_Squadron&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMy Screens:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/pAnnnAAEF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/pAnnnAAEF&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:164b758d2a9b22ae8b9fa1c5d36ab66fd8211aa7","amp;dn":"Star+Wars%3A+Rogue+Squadron+3D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"164b758d2a9b22ae8b9fa1c5d36ab66fd8211aa7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,75,117,141,42,155,34,174,139,159,161,197,211,106,182,111,216,33,26,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
