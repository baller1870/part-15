Until now. Based on studies conducted by the author and the latest knowledge on comfort, Aircraft Interior Comfort and Design links scientific research on customer likes and dislikes with technical know-how of aircraft interior design. It contains theoretical information on comfort gathered directly from the voice of the passenger, specific tips and photographs on passenger likes and dislikes, and an overview of the latest scientific demands for passenger seats.\n\nPresenting the results of current research and development in the aircraft interior industry, this book provides insight that, when applied to the daily work of managing the passenger experience, can lead to further improvements. The author makes the case for using improved comfort as a selling tool and identifies new opportunities for comfort improvement in the different phases of the passenger experience. He demonstrates how by optimizing the passengersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ senses at each phase, you can design comfort back into flying.\n\n\n# Paperback: 134 pages\n# Publisher: CRC Press; 1 edition (March 22, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1439863059\n# ISBN-13: 978-1439863053","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fa63b408173bc2509bd14d49ad76fb9517b7205","amp;dn":"Aircraft+Interior+Comfort+and+Design+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fa63b408173bc2509bd14d49ad76fb9517b7205","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,166,59,64,129,115,188,37,9,189,20,212,154,215,111,185,81,123,114,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
