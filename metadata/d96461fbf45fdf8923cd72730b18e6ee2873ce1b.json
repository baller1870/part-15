Directed by Takao Okawara and featuring special effects by Koichi Kawakita, the film starred Masahiro Takashima, Ryoko Sano, and Megumi Odaka. Despite being produced and released in 1993, this twentieth film in the Godzilla series was marketed as the 40th anniversary Godzilla movie.\nThe film featured the return of classic characters from the original series such as Rodan and Mechagodzilla, as well as introducing an infant Godzilla named BabyGodzilla. Although it shares a title with Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla, the film is neither a remake nor a re-imagining of the earlier film. Despite its North American title, the film is not a sequel to the original Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla, nor does it share any connections or similarities with the original.\n\nFormat                         : AVI\nFile size                      : 700 MiB\nDuration                       : 1h 45mn\nOverall bit rate               : 926 Kbps\nWidth                          : 608 pixels\nHeight                         : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio           : 1.727\nFrame rate                     : 23.976 fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d96461fbf45fdf8923cd72730b18e6ee2873ce1b","amp;dn":"Godzilla+Vs.+Mechagodzilla+2+%281993%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d96461fbf45fdf8923cd72730b18e6ee2873ce1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,100,97,251,244,95,223,137,35,205,114,115,11,24,230,238,40,115,206,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
