OVERDUE GOODBYE (Reprise) 01:35\n\nBiography by William Ruhlmann\n\nRaised in New York City, Anastacia came from an entertainment-oriented family: her father was a singer; her mother an actress in musical theater on Broadway. Despite being diagnosed with the chronic intestinal illness Crohn&amp;#039;s disease at age 13, she developed a career as a dancer, appearing on Club MTV and in such music videos as Salt-N-Pepa&amp;#039;s &quot;Everybody Get Up&quot; and &quot;Twist and Shout.&quot; In 1999, she was a finalist on the MTV talent contest show The Cut, which attracted the interest of record labels. She signed to the Daylight custom label of Sony Music&amp;#039;s Epic Records and recorded her debut album, Not That Kind, which was released internationally in 2000.\nThe result was massive success: the album reached the Top Ten in eight European and Far East countries, selling over two million copies. At home, the single &quot;I&amp;#039;m Outta Love&quot; became a dance hit, paving the way for the release of a revised version of Not That Kind in the U.S. in March 2001. A year later, she was creating a buzz in America. She joined Mary J. Blige, Cher, Shakira, and others for VH1&amp;#039;s fifth annual Divas Live showcase in May 2002. She made her proper American debut with Freak of Nature in June. A self-titled album followed in 2004, with the compilation Pieces of a Dream: Best Of arriving a year later. After making a successful foray into fashion with her own clothing line in 2006, Anastacia returned to music in 2007 with plans to release a new album and tour in 2008.\n\nReview by Jose F. Promis\n\nAnastacia&amp;#039;s sophomore outing, Freak of Nature, continues with the late-&amp;#039;80s bombastic funk/soul/pop revival ushered in by her debut, Not That Kind, but this time there&amp;#039;s a few more ballads in the mix. Anastacia also leans more toward straightforward rock on this outing, while still maintaining the irresistible dance grooves that made her debut an international success. The album kicks off to a rocking start with the title track, which boasts a sinuous guitar solo reminiscent of &quot;American Woman&quot; and then leads into the soulful, bombastic rocker &quot;Paid My Dues,&quot; a massive European hit. Other shining moments include the dramatic &quot;One Day in Your Life,&quot; which follows the same formula as her previous hit, &quot;I&amp;#039;m Outta Love,&quot; but better, with more soaring, epic vocals, and sounds like a rock version of a forgotten disco classic. The feel-good soul-funk vibe of &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Stop (Doin&amp;#039; It)&quot; is a massive hit waiting to happen, and perfect for a breezy summer afternoon. When Anastacia slows down the tempo for the ballads (some organic and acoustic, some bordering on power ballads), she succeeds by utilizing her strong vocal chops without venturing into vocal histrionics. Reminiscent of Taylor Dayne at times, Anastacia successfully avoids the sophomore slump by delivering an album full of raw emotion, power, and musicality which manages to improve upon its predecessor. As a final note, the Destiny&amp;#039;s Child-sounding &quot;Why&amp;#039;d You Lie to Me&quot; and the sassy &quot;Don&amp;#039;tcha Wanna&quot; both appear on the American version of Not That Kind.\n\nEnjoy.
