In a very clear and wonderful way the Supreme Lord Krishna describes the science of self-realization and the exact process by which a human being can establish their eternal relationship with God. In terms of pure, spiritual knowledge the Bhagavad- Gita is incomparable. Its intrinsic beauty is that its knowledge applies to all human beings and does not postulate any sectarian idealogy or secular view. It is appproachable from the sanctified realms of all religions and is glorified as the epitome of all spiritual teachings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d58c62688a9599302f876146e688d324821a7f8","amp;dn":"Bhagvad+Gita+Audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d58c62688a9599302f876146e688d324821a7f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,88,198,38,136,169,89,147,2,248,118,20,110,104,141,50,72,33,167,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
