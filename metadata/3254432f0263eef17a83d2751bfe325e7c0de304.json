The author, Howard Grief, is the originator of the thesis that de jure sovereignty over the entire Land of Israel and Palestine was vested in the Jewish People as a result of the San Remo Resolution adopted at the San Remo Peace Conference on April 24, 1920, which divided the land of the Ottoman Empire after World War I.\n\nHoward Grief has given us a book that shatters every myth, lie, misrepresentation and distortion employed to negate the sovereign rights of the Jewish People to their national home.\n\nIt is a lengthy treatise, but the Jewish peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long and tortuous struggle to retrieve their stolen patrimony deserves nothing less than full disclosure.\n\nAnyone who has ever been at a loss to counter the slanders and calumnies that are the stock in trade of the Israel-bashers and anti-Semites on both the Left and Right will treasure every one of its 20 illuminating chapters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3254432f0263eef17a83d2751bfe325e7c0de304","amp;dn":"Legal+Foundation+and+Borders+of+Israel+under+International+Law","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3254432f0263eef17a83d2751bfe325e7c0de304","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,84,67,47,2,99,238,241,122,131,210,117,27,254,50,94,124,13,227,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
