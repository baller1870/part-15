When the wealthy uncle of the Read family dies, he leaves instructions in his will to bequeath a set amount of money to his mistress, one Mary Collins. The family assumes it to be a pretty young female radio personality called Mary Collins (and played by Deanna Durbin), when it is, in fact, her aunt of the same name (Jean Adair). Thus, when the young scion of the Read family, Donald (John Dall), tries to buy &quot;Mary&quot; off, he picks the wrong Mary -- and Durbin rebuffs him. Donald and brother Charlie (Donald O'Connor) then resort to kidnapping Mary from the radio station, but Mary turns the tables by demanding a million dollars as a settlement. Meanwhile, Charlie pines for Donald's fiancÃƒÂ©e, Clarissa Prentice (Helena Carter), while young Mary and Donald argue constantly and start to fall in love with one another. Amid these soapy events, Durbin finds time to sing five pop songs, as well as the Miserere aria from Verdi's Il Trovatore, on which she duets with Jan Peerce. Durbin's pop numbers include: &quot;The Turntable Song,&quot; &quot;You Wanna Keep Your Baby Lookin' Right,&quot; and &quot;Happy Go Lucky and Free.&quot;\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 855 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 89 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 89 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9636fc7bf998568dddf43809ed10585ae209bbfd","amp;dn":"Deanna+Durbin+Sweetheart+Pack+-+Something+in+the+Wind+%281947%29+Xvi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9636fc7bf998568dddf43809ed10585ae209bbfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,54,252,123,249,152,86,141,221,244,56,9,237,16,88,90,226,9,187,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
