Aveline, a powerful priestess, needs a warrior for her secret mission of starting a holy war. She binds Rhiannon with double-edged oaths and a magical sword. A love affair worthy of troubadours' songs clashes with loyalty, intrigue, ambition, and war, tangling the three women in a web that perhaps not even Rhiannon's sword can cut through.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:124fc070dde5eaea448fadec537c6ce23dfb4d78","amp;dn":"L-J+Baker+-+Lady+Knight","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"124fc070dde5eaea448fadec537c6ce23dfb4d78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,79,192,112,221,229,234,234,68,143,173,236,83,124,108,226,61,251,77,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
