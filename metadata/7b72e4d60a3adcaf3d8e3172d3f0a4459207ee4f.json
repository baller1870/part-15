The rest -- 96 percent of the universe -- is completely unknown.\n\nRichard Panek tells the dramatic story of how scientists reached this cosmos-shattering conclusion, and what theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re doing to find this &quot;dark&quot; matter and an even more bizarre substance called dark energy. This is perhaps the greatest mystery in all of science, and solving it will bring fame, funding, and certainly a Nobel Prize. Based on in-depth, on-site reporting and hundreds of interviews -- with everyone from BerkeleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s feisty Saul Perlmutter and Johns HopkinsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s meticulous Adam Riess to the quietly revolutionary Vera Rubin -- the book offers an intimate portrait of the bitter rivalries and fruitful collaborations, the eureka moments and blind alleys, that have fueled their search, redefined science, and reinvented the universe.\n\nThe stakes couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be higher. Our view of the cosmos is profoundly wrong, and Copernicus was only the beginning: not just Earth, but all common matter is a marginal part of existence. PanekÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fast-paced narrative, filled with behind-the-scenes details, brings this epic story to life for the very first time.\n\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\n&quot;The centerpiece of The 4% Universe is a compelling narrative of science at its bestÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ serve[s] handsomely as an illuminating guide to the dark mysteries lying at the heart of the intersection of astronomy and fundamental physics.&quot;\n\n\n--The Wall Street Journal\n\n\n\n&quot;Impeccably researched and highly readable.&quot;\n\n\n--New Scientist\n\n\n&quot;Panek's passion for the mysteries of dark matter and dark energy wins the day. He succeeds because he recognizes that he's writing not just about red shifts and supernovae, but about people...the success of The 4 Percent Universe also stems from Panek's wisdom about how science works.&quot;\n\n\n--The Washington Post\n\n\n\n&quot;The balance between lively characters and provocative ideas keeps the book moving as quickly as any high stakes thriller, but the pay-off here is an answer of truly cosmic significance...the universe is keeping secrets from us--big secrets. Dark secrets. Panek's joyful journey through the wilds of modern cosmology gives us good reason to care about those secrets, and their sure-to-be surprising answers.&quot;\n\n\n--Ad Astra, Magazine of National Space Society\n\n\n\n&quot;A superior account of how astronomers discovered that they knew almost nothing about 96 percent of the universe. Science writer Panek (The Invisible Century: Einstein, Freud, and the Search for Hidden Universes, 2005, etc.) points out that 50 years ago astronomers assumed they understood the cosmos and its history from the big bang to galaxy formation to its ultimate fate as expansion continued. One detail remained disturbing: Galaxies were moving too fast. Since gravity controls movements, they had to be heavier than predicted. By the 1980s, this &quot;missing mass&quot; problem became critical as it became clear that galaxies, including ours, were rotating so fast that missing mass far outweighs visible objects such as stars. Even after eliminating gas and dust, &quot;dark matter&quot; represents strange particles unknown to science. Astronomers also believed that gravity was slowing expansion of the universe but debated if galaxies would reverse themselves, continue to recede ever more slowly or (the favorite theory) simply stop. Panek describes frustrating struggles with high-tech detectors, complex computer algorithms and massive telescopes to search distant galaxies for the key. The answer came in the late '90s expansion wasn't slowing but speeding up. Flabbergasted astronomers understood that accelerating billions of galaxies requires immense energy. Since Einstein proved that energy and mass are equivalent, this &quot;dark energy&quot; makes up three-quarters of the universe. Dark energy added to dark matter reduces the familiar universe to 4 percent of the total. Panek delivers vivid sketches of scientists, lucid explanations of their work and revealing descriptions of the often stormy rivalry that led to this scientific revolution, usually a media cliche, but not in this case.&quot;\n\n\n--Kirkus Reviews, STARRED review\n\n\n\n&quot;There has always been more to the universe than we can see. Science journalist Panek (The Invisible Century) offers an insider's view of the quest for what could be the ultimate revelation: the true substance of the unseen dark matter and energy that makes up some 96% of our universe. The search for these hidden elements began in the 1960s with astronomers asking whether the universe would end in an infinitely expanding &quot;Big Chill&quot; or a collapse into a &quot;Big Crunch&quot;--or whether the universe is a just-right &quot;Goldilocks&quot; space that would nurture stars and galaxies forever. To answer this question, scientists calculated the universe's mass and discovered there was far more mass than we could see. But where is this &quot;missing mass&quot; and what kind of exotic &quot;dark&quot; stuff is it made of? Panek gleefully describes a 'Wild West of the mind, where resources were scarce, competition was fierce, and survival depended on small alliances of convenience, often enduring just long enough to publish a paper.' This lively story of big personalities, intellectual competitiveness, and ravenous curiosity is as entertaining as it is illuminating.&quot;\n\n\n--Publishers Weekly, STARRED review\n\n\n\n&quot;The 4% Universe is a lively and well-researched account of the personalities and ambitions of modern scientists.&quot;\n\n\n--Alan Lightman, author of EinsteinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dreams\n\n\n\n&quot;Somebody needed to tell this story -- of all that is dark and mysterious in the cosmos. Science writer Richard Panek has risen to that task. In his journalistic yet artful style, Panek guides you through the quirky discoveries that established the existence of dark matter and dark energy. But along the way, you also get to meet the quirky cosmologists who got us there.&quot;\n\n\n--Neil deGrasse Tyson, American Museum of Natural History, author of Death by Black Hole\n\n\n\n&quot;A contemporary adventure story of modern-day explorers who venture forth into the universe not by ships, but by telescopes and satellites. . . . Riveting.&quot;\n\n\n--Lee Smolin, author of The Trouble with Physics\n\n\n\n&quot;ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the biggest mystery of all: why is the universe expanding at an accelerated rate? At its heart is a search for what forces and particles make up reality. It baffled Einstein, and it now obsesses a cadre of fascinating cosmologists. By brilliantly capturing their passions and pursuits, Richard Panek has made this cosmic quest exciting and understandable.&quot;\n\n\n--Walter Isaacson, author of Einstein: His Life and Universe\n\n\n\n&quot;The 4% Universe is a reliable and readable account of how scientists discovered -- and are struggling to come to grips with--the astounding fact that most of the observable universe has not yet even been observed, much less understood. It has the further merit of relating how scientists arrive at their findings, rather than simply presenting their theories as objects of admiration or adoration. Highly recommended.&quot;\n\n\n--Timothy Ferris, author of Coming of Age in the Milky Way and The Science of Liberty\n\n\n\n&quot;Modern cosmology tackles some of the biggest questions we have about the nature of the cosmos. In The 4% Universe, Richard Panek brings this quest down to a human scale. The rivalries, the surprises, and the excitement are brought vividly to life. People are a very tiny percentage of the universe, but we remain the most interesting part.&quot;\n\n\n--Sean Carroll, author of From Eternity to Here: The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time\n\n\n\nA Q&amp;A with Richard Panek, Author of The Four Percent Universe\n\nQ: What is the &quot;four percent universe&quot;?\n\nPanek: ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the universe weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve always known, the one that consists of everything we see: you, me, Earth, Sun, planets, stars, galaxies.\n\nQ: WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the other 96 percent?\n\nPanek: The stuff we canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t see in any form whatsoever. At a loss for words, astronomers have given these missing ingredients the names &quot;dark matter&quot; and &quot;dark energy.&quot;\n\nQ: What are dark matter and dark energy?\n\nPanek: If you find out, book yourself a flight to Stockholm.\n\nQ: So nobody knows? We're not talking about &quot;dark&quot; as in black holes?\n\nPanek: No. This is &quot;dark&quot; as in unknown for now and possibly forever.\n\nQ: Well, then, what do astronomers mean by &quot;dark matter&quot;?\n\nPanek: A mysterious substance that comprises about 23 percent of the universe.\n\nQ: And dark energy?\n\nPanek: Something even more mysterious that comprises about 73 percent of the universe.\n\nQ: Okay, 73 and 23 add up to 96 percent, which does leave a four percent universe. But if we donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know what dark matter and dark energy are, how do we even know theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re there?\n\nPanek: In the 1970s, astronomers observed that the motions of galaxies, including our own Milky Way, seem to be violating the universal law of gravitation. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re spinning way too fast to survive more than a single rotation, yet we know that our galaxy has gone through dozens of rotations in its billions of years of life. Galaxies are living fast but not dying young--a fact that makes sense only if we say that thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more matter out there, gravitationally holding galaxies and even clusters of galaxies together, than we can see. Astronomers call this substance dark matter.\n\nQ: And the mysterious dark energy?\n\nPanek: In the 1990s, two independent teams of astronomers set out to discover the fate of the universe. They knew the universe was born in a big bang and has been expanding ever since. Now they wanted to know how much the mutual gravitation among all this matter--dark or otherwise--was affecting the expansion of the universe. Enough to slow it down so that the universe would eventually grind to a halt, then collapse on itself? Or just enough that the expansion would grind to a halt and stay there? In 1998 the two teams came to the same conclusion: the expansion of the universe isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t slowing down at all. In fact, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s speeding up. And whatever force is counteracting gravity is what they call dark energy.\n\nQ: Do astronomers have any clue as to what dark matter and dark energy might be?\n\nPanek: Yes and no. As for dark matter, they think it might be one of two subatomic particles, but physicists have been looking for these particles for thirty years and still havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t found them. As for dark energy, they donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even have an idea of what it might be. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re still trying to figure out how it behaves. Does it change over space and time or not? If they can answer that question, then they can start to worry about what dark energy is.\n\nQ: If astronomers themselves donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know what dark matter and dark energy are, why should people believe that they exist?\n\nPanek: Scientists like to quote a saying of Carl SaganÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s: &quot;Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.&quot; Many astronomers in the 1970s strongly resisted the idea of dark matter until the evidence became overwhelming. And even the two teams of astronomers that discovered the evidence for dark energy in 1998 resisted the idea until they could no longer come up with another explanation.\n\nQ: Sounds like science is a pretty straightforward process of discovery and follow-up.\n\nPanek: Straightforward, maybe. Pretty, no. As I show in The Four Percent Universe, the discoveries involved a lot of behind-the-scenes rivalries that sometimes turned ugly--rivalries that continue to this day. But in a way, these rivalries have been good for the science. When scientists who would like nothing more than to prove one another wrong wind up agreeing on a weird result, their peers canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t help but take the result seriously. Astronomers hate to say it--theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re as superstitious as anyone else, and they think theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll jinx their chances--but there are Nobel Prizes at stake here.\n\nQ: So this is real. Astronomers actually believe that 96 percent of the universe is &quot;missing&quot;?\n\nPanek: Yes. They call it the ultimate Copernican revolution. Not only are we not at the center of the universe, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not even made of the same stuff as the vast majority of the universe.\n\nQ: What now?\n\nPanek: Nobody knows! And for astronomers, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the exciting part. Again and again, at conference after conference and in interview after interview, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve heard astronomers say that they canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t believe how fortunate they are to be scientists at this point in history. Four hundred years ago, Galileo turned a telescope to the night sky and discovered that thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more out there than the five planets and couple of thousand stars that meet the eye. Now astronomers are saying that thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more out there, period--whether it meets the eye or not. Lots more: the vast majority of the universe, in fact.\n\nQ: If this revolution is such a big deal, why havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t we heard about it?\n\nPanek: Because itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just beginning. Only in the past ten years have scientists reached a consensus that what weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve always thought was the universe is really only four percent of it. Now they feel that figuring out the missing 96 percent is the most important problem in science.\n\nQ: Will finding answers make our lives better? WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the payoff?\n\nPanek: On an immediate, day-to-day, price-of-milk level, nothing. But GalileoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s observations starting in 1609 completely changed the physics and philosophy of the next four hundred years in ways nobody could have anticipated. As I argue in The Four Percent Universe, this new revolution is going to have the same kind of effect on civilization. The fun is just beginning.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nRICHARD PANEK is the recipient of a Guggenheim fellowship and the author of The Invisible Century and Seeing and Believing.
