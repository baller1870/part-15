The sensation of falling in love comes from a chemical secreted by the nervous system, \nphenylethylamine (or PEA, as Lowndes calls it, as in &quot;Scientists tell us only PEA-brained people fall in Love&quot;),\nand the trick is to trigger the manufacture of PEA in your potential love partner, giving him or her the \nsensation of being in love. \n\nLowndes offers 85 techniques for &quot;Hunters and Huntresses&quot; to capture their &quot;Quarry.&quot; Much of what the book \noffers is common sense--the power of eye contact and compliments--but it's presented in a new way and with \nsuch detail that it seems that it can't help but work.\n\nFollowing some of her advice will have you treading that fine line between nice and obsequious, and at times,\nthis book may sound offensive to some, advising the reader to play what may sound like games. Lowndes is aware\nof this, and she offers some caveats, but still it is hard to get past advice such as, &quot;Show him you're smart, \nbut remember--not too smart&quot; or &quot;Watch your Quarry's reactions to outside stimuli, then show the same emotions.&quot;\nIn all fairness, Lowndes doesn't play favorites: her advice to men and women can be equally appalling. Yet, the \nrelaxed style of this book, presenting solid wisdom with a bit of scientific support, makes this book appealing,\nand, who knows, maybe it will make you more appealing, too! --Jenny Brown\n\nHere, from bestselling author Leil Lowndes, is a surefire guide to love for anyone seeking romantic bliss. \nIn How to Make Anyone Fall in Love with You readers will find 85 techniques based on scientific studies\nregarding the nature of love, including:\n\nFinding potential love partners\nMaking an unforgettable first impression\nDodging &quot;love bloopers&quot;\nEstablishing sexual rapport\nBy using these pragmatic, down-to-earth strategies, anyone can turn new or casual relationships into lasting\nones--or make current relationships deeper.\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d936089a738ed997d6ae064e81ee4dd5a693cc0","amp;dn":"HOW+TO+MAKE+ANYONE+FALL+IN+LOVE+WITH+YOU+-+MANTESHWER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d936089a738ed997d6ae064e81ee4dd5a693cc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,147,96,137,167,56,237,153,125,106,224,100,232,30,228,221,90,105,60,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
