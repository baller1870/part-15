But Santa's got problems (he's even mysteriously losing weight) and things quickly go south when he finds out that his son, Charlie, has landed on this year's &quot;naughty&quot; list. Desperate to help his son, Scott heads back home, leaving a substitute Claus to watch over things at the Pole. But when the substitute institutes some strange redefinitions of naughty and nice, putting Christmas at risk, it's up to Scott to return with a new bag of magic to try to save Christmas.\n\n\n\nSanta Clause 3 (2006)\n---------------------\n&quot;His time at the North Pole is about to go South.&quot;\n\nIMDB: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0452681&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0452681&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: English (AAC2.0)\n\nSubs: Danish (hardcoded)\n\n\nAudio encoding:\n- Codec: AAC 2.0\n- Bitrate: 128kbps\n\nVideo encoding:\n- Codec: x264\n- Resolution: 720x406\n- Bitrate: 900kbps\n\nScreenshot: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/06268bb56d5147c6e45f7727f25ccc8f42e5967b.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/06268bb56d5147c6e45f7727f25ccc8f42e5967b.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPlot outline:\nSanta's got problems: it's a few days before Christmas and production lags, Mrs. Claus is about to give birth to their first child and wants family time, and Jack Frost (tired of second billing) is on probation under his supervision. He tries to support his wife by bringing her parents to the North Pole (to preserve his secret, they must think it's Canada). He also brings his ex-wife Laura, her husband Neil, and their daughter Lucy. Inside the toy factory, Jack makes mischief and hatches a plan to become Santa. With Santa juggling that many snow globes, something is bound to go wrong. But if things get too difficult, he can always exercise his option to invoke the Escape Clause. Will he?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23f8227402993e947f72d0e91fe4b0b0f4a383c9","amp;dn":"Santa+Clause+1-2-3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23f8227402993e947f72d0e91fe4b0b0f4a383c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,248,34,116,2,153,62,148,127,114,208,233,31,228,176,176,244,163,131,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
