In a lot of ways 13-year-old Cameron Thompson is a normal teenage boy - obsessed with computer games, sporting the first hints of a moustache and a newfound interest in girls. But he is also a maths genius who is currently doing an Open University degree in applied mathematics and it is this ability that has singled him out. That, and an intense social awkwardness his parents put down to his Asperger's Syndrome. Can Cameron balance the need to remain the genius he has always been - and therefore different - with the classic teenage longing to be accepted?\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c6f20f56f1e2f9f9b47397c5ae771dfc7d5ddfc","amp;dn":"The+Growing+Pains+of+a+Teenage+Genius+++%28BBC+2011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c6f20f56f1e2f9f9b47397c5ae771dfc7d5ddfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,111,32,245,111,30,47,159,155,71,57,124,90,231,113,223,199,213,221,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
