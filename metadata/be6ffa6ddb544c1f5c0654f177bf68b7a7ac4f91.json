The \n       world's favourite award winning sheep, Shaun, is back with another \n       series of hilarious farmyard antics. Having taken the world by \n       storm with the sensational slapstick comedy of his first season, \n       Shaun and his frolicsome flock return, along with the Farmer and \n       the long suffering sheepdog Bitzer, in another forty fantastically \n       funny episodes.\n       \n       Timmy accidentally eats a tomato grown with &quot;Miracle Grow&quot; \n       fertilizer and expands to become the King Kong of sheep. Shaun must \n       keep the giant toddler out of sight while trying to figure out how \n       to return him to normal size.\n\n\n                             Big up all scene massive!\n\n\n    \n                                       \n                GROUP  INFORMATION          \n         9 Years of the Force and still    \n                      going strong                  \n     \n\n           What we are looking for:\n\n           * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n           * 100mbit or gigabit archive sites for TV/XVID/ETC\n           * 1080p or 720p rippers pre retail or classics\n           * Fios cappers in u.s\n           * U.K or Pre Retail Dvdrippers\n           * Internal 100mbit 1tb+ dump sites for Exlusive group usage\n           * If you think you can help contact us on irc\n           * or email us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;abedc4d9c8ceebc3ded8c385cac2&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be6ffa6ddb544c1f5c0654f177bf68b7a7ac4f91","amp;dn":"Shaun.The.Sheep.S03E09.HDTV.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be6ffa6ddb544c1f5c0654f177bf68b7a7ac4f91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,111,250,109,219,84,76,31,92,6,84,241,119,191,104,183,167,172,79,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
