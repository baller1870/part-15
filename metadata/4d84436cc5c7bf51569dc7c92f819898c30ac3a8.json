Throughout his career he has been involved in covert operations in many of the world's hotspots; places like Yemen, Northern Ireland and Russia. He is an accomplished combat pistol shot and has an abiding interest in ancient and medieval history.\n\nChris Bronson Series:\n1. The First Apostle (2008)\n2. The Moses Stone (2009)\n3. The Messiah Secret (2010)\n4. The Nosferatu Scroll (2011)\n5. Echo of the Reich (2012)\n\nFull Retail. ePub, Mobi, AZW3. I liken him to Steve Berry and the Cotton Malone series with a bit more language and violence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d84436cc5c7bf51569dc7c92f819898c30ac3a8","amp;dn":"Chris+Bronson+Series+%28ePub%2C+Mobi%2C+AZW3+Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d84436cc5c7bf51569dc7c92f819898c30ac3a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,132,67,108,197,199,191,81,86,157,199,201,47,129,152,152,195,10,195,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
