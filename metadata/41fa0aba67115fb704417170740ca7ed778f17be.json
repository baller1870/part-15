Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\nElegant, passionate, and filled with the love of God's creation, Abraham Joshua Heschel's The Sabbath has been hailed as a classic of Jewish spirituality ever since its original publication--and has been read by thousands of people seeking meaning in modern life.

It is, rather, our century's most illuminating study of the dynamics of Jewish ritual living.&quot;--Dr. Neil Gillman, author of Sacred Fragments \n\n&quot;Timeless.
