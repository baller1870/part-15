This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nThere is a song that took its title from, and was inspired by, a 1948 movie about gangsters hiding out in a Florida hotel and caught in the middle of a hurricane.\n\nA listener wants to know, &quot;What song in all of chart history has hit number one in the most different versions?&quot;  Casey tells about the three songs that hit number one as original hits, and then again as remakes. Then he tells about the champ which is a song that hit number one by three different artists - all in a seven week period - back in the summer of 1946.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;What male and female solo artists in the rock era have had the most hits in the top 40 at the same time?&quot; For the female artist, there is a three-way tie between Gail, Melanie, and Diana.\n\nCasey retells how Bob Eubanks (host of the Newlywed Game and last week's guest-host of AT40) once turned down the chance to manage a superstar in this countdown, and then plays him one of her number 1 songs as an extra.\n\nThere is a band in the countdown that got signed to play The Ed Sullivan Show after they ambushed Ed Sullivan himself on vacation in Cannes, just to come back to the states and find the show cancelled.\n\nLW#3: Let's Groove - Earth, Wind &amp; Fire\nLW#2: Waiting For A Girl Like You - Foreigner\nLW#1: Physical - Olivia Newton-John\n40: All Our Tomorrows - Eddie Schwartz\n39: Key Largo - Bertie Higgins\n38: Working For The Weekend - Loverboy\n37: Love In The First Degree - Alabama\n36: More Than Just The Two Of Us - Sneaker\n35: Through The Years - Kenny Rogers\n34: Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic - The Police\n33: Oh No - The Commodores\n32: Steal The Night - Stevie Woods\n31: Our Lips Are Sealed - The Go-Go's\n30: Love Is All Right Tonight - Rick Springfield\n29: Under Pressure - Queen &amp; David Bowie\n28: Take Me Heart - Kool &amp; The Gang\n27: Don't Stop Believin' - Journey\n26: Sweet Dreams - Air Supply\n25: Why Do Fools Fall In Love - Diana Ross\n24: She's Got A Way - Billy Joel\n23: You Could Have Been With Me - Sheena Easton\n22: Take It Easy On Me - Little River Band\nLDD: My Guy - Mary Wells\n21: Come Go With Me - The Beach Boys\n20: I Wouldn't Have Missed It For The World - Ronnie Milsap\n19: Leader Of The Band - Dan Fogelberg\n18: Shake It Up - The Cars\n17: Waiting On A Friend - The Rolling Stones\n16: Someone Could Lose A Heart Tonight - Eddie Rabbitt\n15: Young Turks - Rod Stewart\n14: Cool Night - Paul Davis\n13: Hooked On Classics - Royal Philharmonic Orchestra\nEXTRA: You're The One That I Want - Olivia Newton-John\n12: Comin' Inand Out Of Your Life - Barbra Streisand\n11: Yesterday's Songs - Neil Diamond\n10: The Sweetest Thing - Juice Newton\n9: Trouble - Lindsey Buckingham\n8: Turn Your Love Around - George Benson\n7: Leather And Lace - Stevie Nicks W/Don Henley\n6: Harden My Heart - Quarterflash\nLDD: Just Once - Quincy Jones\n5: Centerfold - J.
