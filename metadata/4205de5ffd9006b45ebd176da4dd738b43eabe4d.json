The gods send the West Wind to banish Unico to the Hill of Oblivion, but the West Wind takes pity on Unico and declines to follow the gods' commands. The gods are furious when they learn of the West Wind's defiance, and send the Night Wind to capture Unico. To protect Unico from the gods and the Night Wind, the West Wind must continually transport the little unicorn from place to place. Whenever the gods discover Unico's whereabouts, the West Wind appears to spirit him away once again, often without getting to say goodbye to any of the friends he has made - and without any memory of those friends, as Unico's memory is wiped clean each time.\n\nUnico appeared in several comic strips by Tezuka, with an ecological message. Tezuka's original manga was serialized in Sanrio's &quot;Ririka&quot; (Lyrica) magazine from 1976 to 1979, and was re-published by Shogakukan in 1984 in a learning magazine for children.\n\nUnico is not currently in print on VHS or DVD, but in 2007 (see below) it was announced that both of the feature-length movies finally would be released on DVD in the United States with both English and Japanese audio\t\n\n\n&quot;Polka Production&quot; fandub (Russia)\n\n\nVideo\nID                               : 224 (0xE0)\nFormat                           : MPEG Video\nFormat version                   : Version 2\nFormat profile                   : Main@Main\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default\nDuration                         : 22mn 5s\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 5 773 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                 : 9 800 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nStandard                         : NTSC\nResolution                       : 8 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.557\nStream size                      : 912 MiB (89%)\n\nAudio #1\nID                               : 128 (0x80)\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nDuration                         : 22mn 5s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 224 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 35.4 MiB (3%)\n\nAudio #2\nID                               : 129 (0x81)\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nDuration                         : 22mn 5s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 224 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 35.4 MiB (3%)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4205de5ffd9006b45ebd176da4dd738b43eabe4d","amp;dn":"Unico+%5BOsamu+Tezuka%5D+%5Bmovie%5D%5BRUS%2BJAP%5D+%5BANIME%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4205de5ffd9006b45ebd176da4dd738b43eabe4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,5,222,95,253,144,6,180,94,189,23,109,164,221,115,139,67,234,190,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
