Eddie Jobson has always been one of my favorite keyboardists. This versatile musician can play progressive rock, jazz or even New Age. &quot;Theme of secrets&quot; contains very dreamy electronic New Age tracks, showing evidence of progressive elements, although there are no drums, no guitars, no violins and no bass: actually this record could be a reference when it is time to define what is progressive New Age. He uses state-of-the-art technology for the year, on the occurrence the synclavier: it gives multi-layered, mystic, mysterious, melancholic and nostalgic tracks, with just a small amount of never frightening darkness. Jobson creates here atmospheric &amp; ethereal textures through symphonic and melodic sequenced patterns. It is absolutely not linear nor monotonous. This music gives you a bit the same feeling involved in the listen of David Helpling's &quot;Sleeping on the edge of the World&quot;; the difference is that Helpling is more linear and floating; Jobson is more symphonic. There are some variations on the same theme. \n\nEddie Jobson is a genius: he shows us here that he is not only technically very skilled: he shows us that he is also able to give a soul to his music, which materializes itself in the easiness for the listener to be transported into another Universe. BON VOYAGE AU PAYS DES REVES! \n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED! \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c88e23d5278c7e34435a3fc0fd0f2cc102f65a8","amp;dn":"Eddie+Jobson+-+Theme+of+Secrets+%28Private+Music+1985%2C+New+Age%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c88e23d5278c7e34435a3fc0fd0f2cc102f65a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,136,226,61,82,120,199,227,68,53,163,252,15,208,242,204,16,47,101,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
