Jayas \r\nFormat: PDF \r\nHardcover: 399 pages \r\nPublisher: CRC Press; 1 edition (August 27, 2015) \r\nLanguage: English \r\nISBN: 9781466593671 \r\n\r\n\r\nHighlights the Emergence of Image Processing in Food and Agriculture\r\n\r\nIn addition to uses specifically related to health and other industries, biological imaging is now being used for a variety of applications in food and agriculture. Bio-Imaging: Principles, Techniques, and Applications fully details and outlines the processes of bio-imaging applicable to food and agriculture, and connects other bio-industries, as well as relevant topics. Due to the noncontact and nondestructive nature of the technology, biological imaging uses unaltered samples, and allows for internal quality evaluation and the detection of defects. Compared to conventional methods, biological imaging produces results that are more consistent and reliable, and can ensure quality monitoring for a variety of practices used in food and agriculture industries as well as many other biological industries. The book highlights every imaging technique available along with their components, image acquisition procedures, advantages, and comparisons to other approaches.\r\n\r\n- Describes essential components of imaging technique in great detail\r\n- Incorporates case studies in appropriate chapters\r\n- Contains a wide range of applications from a number of biological fields\r\n\r\nBio-Imaging: Principles, Techniques, and Applications focuses on the imaging techniques for biological materials and the application of biological imaging. This technology, which is quickly becoming a standard practice in agriculture and food-related industries, can aid in enhanced process efficiency, quality assurance, and food safety management overall","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b64a0b16846ae27ce51939735922ff638f004b4","amp;dn":"Bio-Imaging%3A+Principles%2C+Techniques%2C+and+Applications+%5B2015%5D+%5BPD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b64a0b16846ae27ce51939735922ff638f004b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,100,160,177,104,70,174,39,206,81,147,151,53,146,47,246,56,240,4,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
