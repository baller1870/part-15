You play as a badass Cyber-Flamingo with the agility and firepower to take down Cybirdroid, the evil corporation that has captured your fellow flamingos. A horde of avian warbots stand in your way, deploying a range of attacks and battle tactics to stop you. Make it past them, and the Guardians await; brutal boss fights that will throw as much destruction at you as possible. To reach the summit of the tower youâ€™ll need to keep your claws on the move and finger on the trigger!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:855bbbb3265cf80bbf3e86114a55f1b2f88c30f7","amp;dn":"Featherpunk+Prime+v1.202","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"855bbbb3265cf80bbf3e86114a55f1b2f88c30f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,91,187,179,38,92,248,11,191,62,134,17,74,85,241,178,248,140,48,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
