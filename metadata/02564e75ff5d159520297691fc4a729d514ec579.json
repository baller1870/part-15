NOT AVAILABLE ON DVD. \n\nThis is an amusing and touching tale of two average but decent guys in very unusual circumstances. It starts in 1962 and ends in 1992. Peter Berg, Brian Wimmer and Marcia Gay Harden are very good in creating characters that you can easily identify with. Is the story a little far fetched? Yes, but who cares? Anyone who enjoys a great love story with humor blended in will find this movie very charming. Enjoy!\n\n\nPLEASE KEEP SEEDING.\n\n\nSee for more info:  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102279/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102279/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02564e75ff5d159520297691fc4a729d514ec579","amp;dn":"Late+For+Dinner+1991+-+English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02564e75ff5d159520297691fc4a729d514ec579","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,86,78,117,255,93,21,149,32,41,118,145,252,74,114,157,81,78,197,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
