It was only an incomplete draft; the writing is messy and flawed and full of mistakes. I've decided to make the draft available here (at the end of this post). This way, my readers don't have to feel they have to make a sacrifice to stay honest. I hope this fragment gives you further insight into Edward's head and adds a new dimension to the Twilight story. That's what inspired me to write it in the first place.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9178c43a5cd062508b8152f22e81dac9783a7ed7","amp;dn":"midnight+sun+audiobook+for+IPOD+Stephenie+Meyer+5th+Unfinshed+Bo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9178c43a5cd062508b8152f22e81dac9783a7ed7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,120,196,58,92,208,98,80,139,129,82,242,46,129,218,201,120,58,126,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
