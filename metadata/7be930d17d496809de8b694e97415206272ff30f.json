The film revolves round a single, meticulously planned and titanically drug-addled night out in Cardiff.\n\nEncoders notes: \n\nIMPORTANT: This file is created primeraly for direct playback, as is on pc, ps3 and xbox 360. This means the audio must be stereo for xbox360 compatability. If you want a multichannel version, run one of the batch files included to create one from the additional audio. \n\nThis is layed out different than ususal. I've ordered things neatly, added batch files and a toolbox for the batch files. The batch files are used to create different file types from the torrent with as little effort as possible. \n\nThe main movie file is located in the main movie folder and is my usual fair.\n\nThe batch files and toolkit take less than 10mb of space in the torrent.\n\nBatch files included are:\n\nCreate multichannel mp4 file.bat: Creates a ps3 compatable, multichannel mp4 file in the main video file folder.\n\nVista Create multichannel mp4 file.bat: Same as above but for use in Vista os.\n\nCreate AC3 mkv: Creates an mkv using the included, origional AC3 audio. This is ideal for the best pc playback or easy dvd convertion.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nThis was uploaded to fill a request for an old friend. It's also a quick experiment in the layout.\n\nI've not given up on new hd movies. I'm working on an unrated bdrip of mirrors right now and will be doing hellboy 2 after that.\nI've just been trying to fill a few requests and working to find a better solution to the audio isssue.\n\nEnjoy this movie.\n\n-==D-L33T3==-\n\nPilot Release Group\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7be930d17d496809de8b694e97415206272ff30f","amp;dn":"Human+Traffic%5B1999%5DDvdrip+-+D-L33T3%5BPilotRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7be930d17d496809de8b694e97415206272ff30f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,233,48,209,125,73,104,9,222,139,105,78,151,65,82,6,39,47,243,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
