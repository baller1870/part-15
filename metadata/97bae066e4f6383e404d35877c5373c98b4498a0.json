It was released on September 8, 2010, under Warner Bros. Records. The album was written by the band, while production was handled by Linkin Park vocalist Mike Shinoda and Rick Rubin who previously worked together to produce the band's third studio album Minutes to Midnight (2007). Recording sessions for the album took place at NRG Recording Studios in North Hollywood, California from 2008 until early 2010.  A Thousand Suns is a multi-concept album dealing with human fears such as nuclear warfare. The band has acknowledged that the album is a drastic departure from their previous work, as they experimented on different and new sounds for A Thousand Suns. Shinoda stated in an interview with MTV that the album references numerous social issues, as well as blending human ideas with technology. The album's title comes from the line &quot;God save us everyone, will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns&quot; from the first single off the album, &quot;The Catalyst&quot;.[1] It is also a reference to the nuclear bombing of Japan in 1945, the flash of the detonation described by those who survived as &quot;as bright as a thousand suns&quot;.  The lead single for the album, &quot;The Catalyst&quot;, was sent to radio and released to digital music retailers on August 2, 2010. &quot;The Catalyst&quot; peaked at the Billboard Alternative Songs and Rock Songs charts, as well as reaching #27 at the Billboard Hot 100 upon the album's release. Three more singles were released to promote the album, namely &quot;Waiting for the End&quot;, &quot;Burning in the Skies&quot; and &quot;Iridescent&quot;. &quot;The Catalyst&quot; and &quot;Waiting for the End&quot; have been both certified gold by the RIAA. The band promoted the album through the A Thousand Suns World Tour from October 2010 to September 2011.  Upon release, the album was met with positive reviews, but it polarized critics and fans over the band's new direction. Despite this, the album has been a commercial success debuting at number one on over ten charts. The album has been certified gold by the RIAA on February 2011..\n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] The Requiem\n[02] The Radiance\n[03] Burning In The Skies\n[04] Empty Spaces\n[05] When They Come For Me\n[06] Robot Boy\n[07] Jornada Del Muerto\n[08] Waiting For The End\n[09] Blackout\n[10] Wretches And Kings\n[11] Wisdom, Justice, And Love\n[12] Iridescent\n[13] Fallout\n[14] The Catalyst\n[15] The Messenger\n\nCD Play Time - 00h:47m:49s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 324mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
