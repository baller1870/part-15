Despite the large body of emerging market finance literature, their underlying dynamics and interactions with other economies remain challenging and mysterious because standard financial models measure them imprecisely.\nDescribing the linkages between emerging and developed markets, this collection systematically explores several crucial issues in asset valuation and risk management. Contributors present new theoretical constructions and empirical methods for handling cross-country volatility and sudden regime shifts. Usually attractive for investors because of the superior growth they can deliver, emerging markets can have a low correlation with developed markets. This collection advances your knowledge about their inherent characteristics.\n-    Concentrates on post-crisis roles of emerging markets in the global economy\n-    Reports on key theoretical and technical developments in emerging financial markets\n-    Forecasts future developments in linkages among developed and emerging economies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77e2355a2736de58ae3c898aa8174334d6b59b10","amp;dn":"Emerging+Markets+and+the+Global+Economy+-+A+Handbook+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77e2355a2736de58ae3c898aa8174334d6b59b10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,226,53,90,39,54,222,88,174,60,137,138,168,23,67,52,214,181,155,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
