Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot; politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\nGuest: Gavin McInnes\r\n\r\nEpisode 310: We start a brand new TACS week with a recap of Super Bowl and the goings on with Cam Newton, Anthony dispels rumors that he is fact wearing lipstick, gets into the Super Bowl commercials, comic book movies, and an uncomfortable movie called â€œLamb.â€ TACS celebrates the Chinese New Year with a special correspondent explaining the year of the monkey, we look into the awkward republican candidate entrances, Jebâ€™s mommy, Bernie versus Hillary, Larry David on SNL, and we see a video of the latest crane collapse. North Korea is back in the news (as if it ever left), Ant chats some more about Super Bowl and the halftime show, the guys go ass versus ass, Gavin McInnes joins Ant to discuss man rape, rape jokes, a female motocross fail, and question why people even want men and women to be the same. After Anthony preaches free speech, we check in on Casey Anthonyâ€™s tits, see an 8-year-old robber, talk about law abiding gun owners, parentâ€™s naughty items, dicks and New Zealand politics, BeyoncÃ©, Black Panthers, and Bruno Mars. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01f47fa339408ae6a87b9a7b4f6ca5492f4aa66f","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2016-02-08+Gavin+McInnes+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01f47fa339408ae6a87b9a7b4f6ca5492f4aa66f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,244,127,163,57,64,138,230,168,123,154,123,79,108,165,73,47,74,166,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
