What can I tell you about this series? Well, it's four issues, in black and white, published by Eclipse in 1992 as part of their 'F/X' line. Also, it's about vampires.\n\nThat's all I got. Need to work on my salespitch, no?\n\nREGARDLESS, this torrent has all four issues. Thanks be to the creative teams and the scanners! Get it, seed it!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a5c9a6acf812ec347c85d2a088f765e86ed952c","amp;dn":"Blood+is+the+Harvest+%28Eclipse%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a5c9a6acf812ec347c85d2a088f765e86ed952c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,92,154,106,207,129,46,195,71,200,93,42,8,143,118,94,134,237,149,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
