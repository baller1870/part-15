Bob HallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Armed and Dangerous draws on influences from Mickey Spillane to Quentin Tarantino movies to give us the comics equivalent of Pulp Fiction. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s harsh and visceral, but hard to put down.\n\n Armed &amp; Dangerous focuses around Eddy Donovan, a fifteen-year-old kid whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been raised in a boarding school after his parents died. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been called down to New York City by his Uncle Mitch and is discovering that life in the Big Apple is hard for a kid on his own. One day, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sent to deliver a strangely heavy pizza box to his Uncle Mitch in room 41 of a seedy hotel. When he gets there, he discovers a room stained with blood, a body on a bed, and that the Ã¢â‚¬Å“pizza boxÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was full of tools Mitch needed to dismember the body. In short, Eddy Donovan had just discovered the family businessÃ¢â‚¬â€and it was already too late to decide whether or not he wanted to join it. \n\n Enjoy and Seed ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89586f7a866895c37d1c52a1d97fc5ec7f11db7f","amp;dn":"Armed+and+Dangerous+%281996%29+Bob+Hall+Acclaim+Comics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89586f7a866895c37d1c52a1d97fc5ec7f11db7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,88,111,122,134,104,149,195,125,28,82,161,217,127,197,236,127,17,219,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
