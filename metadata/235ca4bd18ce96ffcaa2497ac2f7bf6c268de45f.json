To prove he is who he claims to be, he confesses to three unsolved murders and recalls in great detail an adventuresome life in America and Mexico among cowboys and peasants, in back alleys and docks. \n\nHe is consumed by &quot;the morbid impulse to convince,&quot; but no one believes him. This is a harrowing account--part Kafka, part Camus--of the power of self-deception and the freedom that ultimately lies in self-acceptance. Simultaneously haunting and humorous, I'm Not Stiller has come to be recognized as &quot;one of the major post-war works of fiction&quot; and a masterpiece of German literature.\n\nGenre: Fiction | classics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:235ca4bd18ce96ffcaa2497ac2f7bf6c268de45f","amp;dn":"I%27m+Not+Stiller+by+Max+Frisch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"235ca4bd18ce96ffcaa2497ac2f7bf6c268de45f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,92,164,189,24,206,150,255,202,162,73,122,194,247,191,108,38,141,228,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
