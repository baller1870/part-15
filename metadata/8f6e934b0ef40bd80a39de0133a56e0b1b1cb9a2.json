It was released in December 1980 through Dischord Records (No. 1). Comprising eight songs, Minor Disturbance referenced a number of issues pertinent to the band, from being turned away at local concerts due to their age (&quot;Too Young to Rock&quot;) to what they felt was the increasing complacency of many first wave punk bands (&quot;Fleeting Fury&quot;). Upon its release, Minor Disturbance, Dischord Records' first release, received positive reviews from local fanzines and gained airplay on local radio stations.\n\n01. Teen Idles\n02. Sneakers\n03.
