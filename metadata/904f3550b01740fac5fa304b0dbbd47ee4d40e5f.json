A long time ago, back before the age of computers, we used to play games with little square cardboard counters on big rectangular boards.\n\nThis was the biggie -- it was 32 square feet of board space.  This is the game completely scanned including counters.\n\nIt&amp;#039;s a great game, excellently detailed, and takes about 100 hours to play the campaign.  Get some coffee.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:904f3550b01740fac5fa304b0dbbd47ee4d40e5f","amp;dn":"Avalon+Hill+--+The+Longest+Day+Board+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"904f3550b01740fac5fa304b0dbbd47ee4d40e5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,79,53,80,176,23,64,250,197,250,48,75,13,187,212,126,228,212,14,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
