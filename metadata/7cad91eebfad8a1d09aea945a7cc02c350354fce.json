Ten nationalities of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most skilled riders line a grid armed with cutting-edge motorcycle technology with prototype machinery fielded by three manufacturers; Ducati, Yamaha and Honda.\nEstablished as a World Championship by the FIM (FÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©ration Internationale de Motocyclisme) in 1949, MotoGPÃ¢â€žÂ¢ is now into its 65th year. It is the oldest motorsports championship in the world and the premier class of three racing classes that take to the track on a typical Grand Prix weekend. Formerly labelled Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ500ccÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, the championship underwent a change in 2002 with new technical regulations permitting the introduction of four-stroke machinery and increasing the engine capacity to 990cc, thus becoming MotoGPÃ¢â€žÂ¢. From 2007 the rules were altered, limiting engine capacity to 800cc, and once again from 2012, setting the maximum engine displacement at 1000cc. MotoGPÃ¢â€žÂ¢ has been administrated by commercial rights owners Dorna Sports under the supervision of the FIM since 1992.\nMotoGPÃ¢â€žÂ¢ has a rich history with Grand Prix events having taken place in every corner of the world throughout the last 64 years. More than 2.2 million people came through the gates of the circuits to watch MotoGPÃ¢â€žÂ¢ in 2012. Italy, Great Britain, Spain, the USA and Australia are just some of the nationalities that have all totalled high numbers in terms of race victories and world titles, the details of which can be found in the Results &amp; Statistics section.\nAs well as the premier class there are also two ultra-competitive World Championship Grand Prix categories, which form part of Ã¢â‚¬ËœMotoGPÃ¢â€žÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â„¢. The Moto3Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (formerly 125cc) and Moto2Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (formerly 250cc) World Championships have their own races at each Grand Prix, meaning that by the end of the season three champions are crowned.\n\nguyz pls seed as much as u can \n\nThnx GuyZ..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cad91eebfad8a1d09aea945a7cc02c350354fce","amp;dn":"Moto+GP+URT+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cad91eebfad8a1d09aea945a7cc02c350354fce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,173,145,238,191,173,138,29,9,174,169,69,167,204,2,195,80,53,79,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
