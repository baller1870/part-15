For Sweet, the melodic sensibilities, adventurous arrangements, and production values of '60s and '70s pop have remained long-lost Holy Grails to be passionately sought. Closing out what he's termed rock's &quot;dry decade&quot; (for its production values, if not content), In Reverse hearkens back to Phil Spector's wall of sound and Brian Wilson's mid-'60s studio prime with a vengeance. (The great bassist of choice during those epochal recordings, Carol Kaye, is a key player here.) Epic in scope and harmonically intoxicating (if occasionally overwrought), this is an album by an artist measuring the distance between his reach and his grasp, his good sense and self-indulgence, his confidence growing with every back-to-the future track. --Jerry McCulley \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/05/01/the-thorns/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:603e832167b4d7e3585ae72e6230fc3da7a2c115","amp;dn":"Matthew+Sweet...In+Reverse%281999%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"603e832167b4d7e3585ae72e6230fc3da7a2c115","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,62,131,33,103,180,215,227,88,90,231,46,98,48,252,61,167,162,193,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
