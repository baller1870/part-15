He's won two International Thriller Awards and four Bram Stoker Awards, as well as having been nominated for the Edgar, the World Fantasy Award, the Macavity, and Le Grand Prix de l'Imaginaire.\n\nTerrier Rand series:\nThe Last Kind Words (#1): Raised in a clan of small-time thieves and grifters, Terrier Rand decided to cut free from them and go straight after his older brother, Collie, went on a killing spree that left an entire family and several others dead. Five years later, only days before his scheduled execution, Collie contacts Terry and asks him to return home. He claims he wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t responsible for one of the murdersÃ¢â‚¬â€and insists that the real killer is still on the loose.\n\nUncertain whether his brother is telling the truth, and dogged by his own regrets, Terry is drawn back into the activities of his family: His father, Pinsch, who once made a living as a cat burglar but retired after the heartbreak caused by his two sons. His cardsharp uncles, Mal and Grey, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve recently incurred the anger of the local mob. His grandfather, Old Shep, who has AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s but is still a first-rate pickpocket. His teenage sister, Dale, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flirting with the lure of the criminal world. And Kimmy, the fiancÃƒÂ©e he abandoned, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s now raising a child with his former best friend.\nAs Terry starts to investigate what really happened on the day of CollieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crime spree, will the truth he uncovers about their secrets tear the Rands apart?\n\nThe Last Whisper in the Dark (#2): Professional thief Terrier Rand hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t gotten caught yet. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only his conscience chasing at his heels.\n\nIn the follow-up to Tom PiccirilliÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s acclaimed novel The Last Kind Words, prodigal thief Terrier Rand has come home to the family that has lawbreaking in its blood. With generations of Rands keeping secrets from the outside worldÃ¢â‚¬â€not to mention from one anotherÃ¢â‚¬â€Terry is sure of one thing: He owes it to the woman he loved and lost to make sure her husband stays alive.\n\nKimmyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s husband, TerryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s old friend Chub, hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been seen since he supplied a getaway car for a heist that went wrong. When Terry investigates the ominous disappearance, he discovers that Chub was involved with a strange, violent gang of heavy hittersÃ¢â‚¬â€guys who donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take kindly to Terry asking questions. But before Terry can find his friend, a curvaceous divorcÃƒÂ©e takes him for a walk on the wild side, estranged relatives pull him into their horror movie empire, his sister Dale sets her sights on Hollywood after scoring a hit viral video, and his own uncle recruits Terry to rip off his partner.\n\nIn a world of larceny, grift, and fraud, no amount of loyaltyÃ¢â‚¬â€to friends, wives, or loversÃ¢â‚¬â€can compete with the Rand family drama. Terry just wants to bring Chub home to his wife and child. Instead, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dodging mobsters, moguls, and murderers . . . and the truth about one crime of his own.\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre Reader ready.
