What we see when we look at a scenic view is the result of the interplay of the forces that shape the earthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surface.\nThese operate on many different timescales and involve geological as well as climatic forces. Adrian Harvey introduces the varying geomorphological forces and differing timescales which thus combine: from the global, which shape continents and mountain ranges; through the regional, producing hills and river basins; to the local, forming beaches, glaciers and slopes; to those micro scale forces which weather rock faces and produce sediment. Finally, he considers the effect that humans have had on the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s topography. Introducing Geomorphology provides a structured and easily accessible introduction to the science of geomorphology for those with an adult curiosity about the landscape and for those contemplating a course of formal study in physical geography, geology or environmental studies. \nAs with sister volumes, technical terms are kept to a minimum and a glossary is provided. \n\nIntroducing Geomorphology:\nA Guide to Landforms and Processes\nBy: Adrian Harvey\nLanguage: EN\nFormat: PDF\nPages: 110\nISBN13: 9781903544433\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a44cd4b52185a9fe1042217937c22b799a38eb42","amp;dn":"Introducing+Geomorphology+by+Adrian+Harvey+%28Perseu%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a44cd4b52185a9fe1042217937c22b799a38eb42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,76,212,181,33,133,169,254,16,66,33,121,55,194,43,121,154,56,235,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
