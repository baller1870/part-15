Though her death is ruled a suicide, veteran investigative journalist Scott McGrath suspects otherwise. As he probes the strange circumstances surrounding AshleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and death, McGrath comes face-to-face with the legacy of her father: the legendary, reclusive cult-horror-film director Stanislas CordovaÃ¢â‚¬â€a man who hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been seen in public for more than thirty years.\n\nFor McGrath, another death connected to this seemingly cursed family dynasty seems more than just a coincidence. Though much has been written about CordovaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dark and unsettling films, very little is known about the man himself.\n\nDriven by revenge, curiosity, and a need for the truth, McGrath, with the aid of two strangers, is drawn deeper and deeper into CordovaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eerie, hypnotic world.\n\nThe last time he got close to exposing the director, McGrath lost his marriage and his career. This time he might lose even more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43d70a0e2ca654af091a94875fced73d750deb5b","amp;dn":"Marisha_Pessl-Night_Film.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43d70a0e2ca654af091a94875fced73d750deb5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,215,10,14,44,166,84,175,9,26,148,135,95,206,215,61,117,13,235,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
