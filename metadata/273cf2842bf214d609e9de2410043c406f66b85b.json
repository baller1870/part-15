In six unforgettable stories, Chris Crutcher captures the real world of teenagers facing tough situations and doing their bestÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½no matter what. Meet Lionel, a great swimmer who lost his parents in a boating accident; Angus Bethune, the fat kid who can dance the pants off anyone; Johnny, whose abusive father makes him do ten push-ups every time he hears a word he doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t like; and Petey, who ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œvolunteersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to wrestle the toughest girl around. Their stories are sometimes tragic, sometimes funny, and always entertaining. An ALA Best Book for Young Adults and a School Library Journal Best Book of the Year, Athletic Shorts is rooted solidly in Chris CrutcherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s experience as a child and family therapist. It tackles some of the grittiest issues facing teenagers todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½racism, underage drinking, AIDSÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½with superb sensitivity and humor.\n\n  Awards - ALSC Notable Recording","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:273cf2842bf214d609e9de2410043c406f66b85b","amp;dn":"ATHLETIC+SHORTS+-+Chris+Crutcher.+Read+Frank+Muller+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"273cf2842bf214d609e9de2410043c406f66b85b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,60,242,132,43,242,20,214,9,233,222,36,16,4,60,64,111,102,184,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
