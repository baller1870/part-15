Many years prior to this incident, a group of eminent scientists led by Dr. Jeremy Stone advocated for the construction of a secure laboratory facility that would serve as a base in the event an alien biological life form was returned to Earth from a space mission. Stone and his team - Drs. Dutton, Leavitt and Hall - go to the facility, known as Wildfire and try to first isolate the life form and to determine why two people from Piedmont, an old wino and a months old baby, survived. The scientists methodically study the alien life form unaware that it has already mutated and presents a far greater danger in the lab, which is equipped with a nuclear self-destruct device should it manage to escape.\n\nCast:\n\nArthur Hill\t... \tDr. Jeremy Stone\nDavid Wayne\t... \tDr. Charles Dutton\nJames Olson\t... \tDr. Mark Hall\nKate Reid\t... \tDr. Ruth Leavitt\nPaula Kelly\t... \tKaren Anson\n\nWritten by: Michael Crichton (novel) &amp; Nelson Gidding (screenplay)\nDirected by: Robert Wise\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEnjoy and don't forget to seed! ;)\n\nBy:\n\nREFLECTIONS\n\n=========================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:290085f8d741426c245b3fe1c167e05920f899d7","amp;dn":"The.Andromeda.Strain.1971.HDTVRip.720p.REFLECTIONS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"290085f8d741426c245b3fe1c167e05920f899d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,0,133,248,215,65,66,108,36,91,63,225,193,103,224,89,32,248,153,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
