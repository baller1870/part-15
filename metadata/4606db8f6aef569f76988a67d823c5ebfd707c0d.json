Ante Genesem (before Genesis)\n\nJack Stanton is the sole survivor of an expedition gone horribly wrong. Against all odds, he has returned with proof of a monolith, 1,500 feet tall, built 20,000 feet above sea level. Inside this monolith is proof that an advanced civilization walked the Earth before man. A civilization of immense power, and incredible evil. As he prepares to promote his new book about the monolith, Jack is haunted by visions and attacked by religious zealots warning of the danger of his findings. Before Jack has time to assess his situation, a supertanker runs aground in New York. This catastrophe somehow causes Jack to be stranded in another dimension. Could this dimension actually be Hell? And if Jack is in Hell, what forces are now free on Earth? Ante Genesem is a must read for fans of the supernatural and the surreal. \n\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4606db8f6aef569f76988a67d823c5ebfd707c0d","amp;dn":"Prophet+%282002%29cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4606db8f6aef569f76988a67d823c5ebfd707c0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,6,219,143,106,239,86,159,118,152,138,103,216,35,197,235,253,112,124,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
