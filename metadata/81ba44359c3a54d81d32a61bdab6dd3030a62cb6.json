These Ã¢â‚¬Å“night peopleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are haunted by secrets and needs that draw them together more powerfully than the differing circumstances that might keep them apart, and it soon becomes clear that EriÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s slumberÃ¢â‚¬â€mysteriously tied to the businessman plagued by the mark of his crimeÃ¢â‚¬â€will either restore or annihilate her.\n\nAfter Dark moves from mesmerizing drama to metaphysical speculation, interweaving time and space as well as memory and perspective into a seamless exploration of human agencyÃ¢â‚¬â€the interplay between self-expression and empathy, between the power of observation and the scope of compassion and love. MurakamiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trademark humor, psychological insight, and grasp of spirit and morality are here distilled with an extraordinary, harmonious mastery.\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                              Published - May 8th 2007\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81ba44359c3a54d81d32a61bdab6dd3030a62cb6","amp;dn":"After+Dark+by+Haruki+Murakami+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81ba44359c3a54d81d32a61bdab6dd3030a62cb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,186,68,53,156,58,84,216,29,50,166,27,218,182,221,48,48,166,44,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
