Even many Democrats were glad to see them go. Yet within just a few years Bill had secured a new reputation as a global humanitarian and Democratic Party elder statesman, and Hillary was running for president. Despite her 2008 loss to Barack Obama, Hillary bounced back to become one of the most powerful and respected figures in his cabinet. Along the way, she and Bill have gone from being virtually penniless to millionaires many times over.\n\nToday the Clintons are among the most popular politicians in AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â€respected and feared by Republicans and Democrats alike. Their transformation has been so complete that it takes an effort to recall just how low their fortunes were a decade ago. Hillary is already the presumptive frontrunner for 2016, while Bill jets around the world dispensing advice, making deals and collecting huge fees. Meanwhile, Chelsea Clinton has emerged as a formidable public figure in her own right.\n\nNone of this happened by accident. Behind the Clintons' remarkable comeback is an untold story of strategic calculation, backroom deals, reckless gambles, and an unquenchable thirst for wealth and power.\n\nIn Clinton, Inc., Weekly Standard reporter Daniel Halper compiles a wealth of research, exclusive documents, and candid interviews with former Clinton administration officials, senators, congressmen, friends, allies, and former enemies of the Clintons to reveal how they rebuilt their reputations, reconstructed their political machine, and positioned themselves for even greater success. Clinton, Inc. describes in intimate detail how the Bill and Hillary partnership works: they are, in effect, dual CEOs of a single enterprise, often playing both sides of the street, sometimes at odds with each other, but always focused on the ultimate goal of reclaiming political power.\n\nHalper provides new insights into their deals with Barack Obama and the inner workings of their surprising friendship with the Bush family; how the Clintons managed to pacify their once most bitter enemies; how Bill and Hillary are laying the groundwork for Hillary's upcoming presidential campaign; and how Vice President Biden and other Democrats are trying to maneuver around her. He reveals the Clintons' plans for Chelsea's future and the lengths to which they will go to protect her carefully cultivated image. Halper also reveals the secrets of the Clintons' skillful media management, the survival of the Clintons' marriage, as well as the Clintons' financial backers and hidden corporate enterprises. The book also discusses a comprehensive Republican effort to bring their ambitions to a halt.\n\nCompulsively readable and filled with juicy scoops and inside information, Clinton, Inc. is the key to understanding America's most powerful political couple.\n\nDaniel Halper is the online editor of the Weekly Standard, where he covers elections, foreign policy, the White House, the State Department, and numerous other political topics. His writing has been featured in Politico, the Jerusalem Post, and the Putnam County Courier. He is a graduate of Tufts University","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c9b7331d6c8108eef19ba252ad960703d197ca4","amp;dn":"Daniel+Halper+-+Clinton%2C+Inc.-+Audacious+Rebuilding+of+a+Politic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c9b7331d6c8108eef19ba252ad960703d197ca4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,155,115,49,214,200,16,142,239,25,186,37,42,217,96,112,61,25,124,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
