Walking in the Air, which Ashkenazy has chosen as the title track of the disc is arranged here for solo piano (and available as an e-single). The song was composed by Blake as the centrepiece of his score for the childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic animated film The Snowman, and exemplifies the composerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s warmly accessible style.\n\n\n Ashkenazy performs no fewer than nine world premiere recordings from BlakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s repertoire and the album features music from BlakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s other film scores, including Ridley ScottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe DuellistsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and horror classic Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe ChangelingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and the Prelude for Vova Op.640, written after Ashkenazy asked Blake to Ã¢â‚¬Å“make a piece out of my initials A.S.H. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ like Liszt did with B.A.C.H.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nHoward BlakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illustrious career has spanned over 50 years in which he has composed more than 650 works, both classical and popular. He has written scores for numerous films, beginning in the 1970s, but it was in 1982, with his orchestral score for The Snowman that Blake achieved widespread acclaim. While he is best known for the Christmas classic, he has written a wide range of music, including a piano concerto for the 30th birthday of Princess Diana.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“His piano music is extremely well written and pianistic, due, of course, to the fact that he is a very good pianist himself,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ explains Ashkenazy, Ã¢â‚¬Å“and so it is truly a joy to playÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Walking In The Air (Excerpt 'Lifecycle'), Op.310\n 02 - Music Box Theme (from 'The Changeling'), Op.274\n 03 - Lara's Theme (from 'The Duellists'), Op.247\n 04 - Prelude For Vova, Op.640\n 05 - Speech After Long Silence, Op.610\n 06 - Twelve Piano Pieces, Op.177 - 1.
