Having recently lost his job and girlfriend, Tom has a rather unsure sense of his own identity. But when he inherits a mysterious box of belongings from a great aunt that he never met, he starts investigating his family lineage and uncovers a whole world of unusual stories and characters and a growing sense of who he is and who his real family are.\n\nFamily Tree is a single-camera, improvisational, mockumentary comedy, a style that Christopher Guest's films have pioneered in the past.\n\n BBC commissioner Janice Hadlow says: &quot;I am delighted to welcome Christopher Guest to BBC Television. It will be his first television series for British audiences and one I am proud to have here on the BBC. It has a stellar cast led by the fantastic Chris O'Dowd and is an exciting collaboration with NBCU International and HBO. Family Tree will form a key part of the channel's comedy next year.&quot;\n\n Christopher Guest says: &quot;I am also delighted to welcome myself to BBC Television. I am very lucky to be working with an incredibly talented cast. Chris O'Dowd has been on my radar ever since he was a child actor in Wales.&quot;\n\n Chris O'Dowd adds: &quot;I'm terribly excited and monumentally under-qualified to work on an improvised show with Chris Guest. I call him Chris 'coz we are friends. He calls me George. I don't know why.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n1/8 Tom is surprised when he is bequeathed an old chest of curios by his great-aunt.\n\n2/8 Tom and Pete investigate an unforeseen aspect of Tom's great-grandfather Harry's life.\n\n3/8 Tom suspects his grandfather competed in the 1948 London 'Austerity Games'.\n\n4/8 Tom, Bea, Keith and Luba head to Derbyshire to meet some recently discovered cousins.\n\n5/8 Tom arrives in Los Angeles to stay with his American cousins, Al and Kitty Chadwick. \n \n6/8 Tom investigates his great-great-grandfather's activities in the American Civil War.\n\n7/8 Tom discovers that his and Bea's great-great-grandmother may have been a native American.\n\n8/8 Bea and Pete decide to spend the day at the beach but Monk goes missing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0182jg4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0182jg4&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n============= What's In This Torrent =============\n\n[b]\nFamily Tree - S01 - E01 - The Box\nFamily Tree - S01 - E02 - Treading The Boards\nFamily Tree - S01 - E03 - The Austerity Games\nFamily Tree - S01 - E04 - Country Life\nFamily Tree - S01 - E05 - Welcome To America\nFamily Tree - S01 - E06 - Civil War\nFamily Tree - S01 - E07 - Indians\nFamily Tree - S01 - E08 - Cowboys\n\n\n\n[/b]\n\n===================== General =====================\nComplete name               : Family Tree.avi\nFormat                      : AVI\nFormat info                 : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                   : 350 MB\nDuration (ms)               : 29mn 28s\nOverallBitRate_Mode/String  : Variable\nTotal bitrate               : 1 660 Kbps\nEncoded application         : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nEncoded library             : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\n===================== Video =====================\nId                          : 0\nFormat                      : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile              : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings - BVOP      : 1\nFormat settings - QPel      : No\nFormat settings - GMC       : No warppoints\nFormat settings - Matrix    : Custom\nCodec Id                    : XVID\nCodec                       : XviD\nDuration (ms)               : 29mn 28s\nBitrate                     : 1 544 Kbps\nWidth                       : 720 pixels\nHeight                      : 416 pixels\nAspect ratio                : 1.731\nFramerate                   : 25.000 fps\nColorimetry                 : YUV\nColos space                 : 4:2:0\nBit depth                   : 8 bits\nScan type                   : Progressive\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.206\nStream size                 : 325 MB (93%)\nEncoded library             : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nId                          : 1\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFormat version              : Version 1\nFormat profile              : Layer 3\nFormat settings mode        : Joint stereo\nFormat settings mode extens : MS Stereo\nCodec Id                    : 55\nCodec                       : MP3\nDuration (ms)               : 29mn 28s\nBitrate mode                : Variable\nBitrate                     : 103 Kbps\nBitRate_Nominal/String      : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nSampling rate               : 48.0 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nStream size                 : 21.8 MB (6%)\nAlignement                  : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave duration         : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave preload          : 523 ms\nEncoded library             : LAME3.98r\nEncoded library settings    : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 --abr 128\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1e566db9f132ad0d1f1f0d5b2f4d753d043b214","amp;dn":"Family+Tree+-+Series+01+-+Sitcom+-+Xvid+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1e566db9f132ad0d1f1f0d5b2f4d753d043b214","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,229,102,219,159,19,42,208,209,241,240,213,178,244,215,83,208,67,178,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
