Many of the covers the trio has included on its five albums to date are classics from the bop era, suggesting a revivalist outfit. But that's not how it is. Instead, the trio use evergreens as familiar as Miles Davis' &quot;So What&quot; or Johnny Mercer's &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; as launching pads for searching explorations into the inner architecture of the compositions, and for imaginative reconstructions of them. Revisionist perhaps; revivalist not.\nAll three players present strong and mature musical personalities. Pianist Helge Lien has a lyrical and understated touch, and a refined sense of humor. Bassist Frode Berg is more extrovert. Drummer Knut AalefjÃƒÂ¦r is creative and distinctive. (AllAboutJazz)\n\nTrack list:\n1. Fall\n2. Trust\n3. Solar\n4. Hymne\n5. So What\n6. What Are You Doing For The Rest Of Your Life\n\nPersonnel:\nHelge Lien: piano\nFrode Berg: bass\nKnut AaleflÃƒÂ¦t: drums\n\nEnjoy and share!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dcd625c83454626915cd6ff8b3e660c6d20e9ec","amp;dn":"Helge+Lien+-+2001+-+What+Are+You+Doing+for+the+Rest+of+Your+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dcd625c83454626915cd6ff8b3e660c6d20e9ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,205,98,92,131,69,70,38,145,92,214,255,139,62,102,12,109,32,233,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
