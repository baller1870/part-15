The interdisciplinary entries in this handbook are organized around the principle of &quot;molecular psychology,&quot; which unites cutting-edge research from such wide-ranging disciplines as clinical neuroscience and genetics, psychology, behavioral neuroscience, and neuroethology. \r\n\r\nFor the first time in a single volume, leaders in diverse research areas use molecular approaches to investigate social behavior, psychopathology, emotion, cognition and stress in healthy volunteers, patient populations, and an array of non-human species including rodents, insects, fish, and non-human primates. Chapters draw on molecular methods covering candidate genes, genome-wide association studies, copy number variations, gene expression studies, and epigenetics while addressing the ethical, legal, and social issues to emerge from this new and exciting research approach","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf28a18938d42b7e1c398d979c155ecbb770d95d","amp;dn":"The+Oxford+Handbook+of+Molecular+Psychology+%5B2015%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf28a18938d42b7e1c398d979c155ecbb770d95d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,40,161,137,56,212,43,126,28,57,141,151,156,21,94,203,183,112,217,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
