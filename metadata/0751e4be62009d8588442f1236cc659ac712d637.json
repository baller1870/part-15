It was one of the first games to run only in Pentium or superior range of processors (for the PC version) but did not have a GPU requirement. Critically, it was hailed as one of the best games of 1997, and sold accordingly. The game soundtrack, composed by Tommy Tallarico, was also released, with moderate success.\n\nThe game tells the story of its protagonist, Kurt Hectic and his attempts to rescue Earth from an alien invasion of gigantic strip mining city-vehicles named 'Minecrawlers', which are not only removing all of earth's natural resources but are also flattening any people and cities that get in their way. The game combined fast action with fully 3D rendered, state-of-the art (for the time) graphics and a warped sense of humour. It featured a never before seen &quot;sniper mode&quot; that allowed the player to zoom in on an enemy and target them with astonishing accuracy.\n\nWorks in DOS, Windows 95/98/XP &amp; Vista!\n\nRipped: Nothing\n\nExtra's: MDK Original Game Soundtrack, The Manual,\nWalkthroughs, The Bonus FMV sequence encoded to wmv\n(Billy Ze Kick - Non Non Rien N'a Change) &amp; DOSBox\n\nInstall: Unzip to any location and play :)\n\nNote: All patches are installed &amp; DOSBox is preconfigured.\n\nMDK.EXE = DOSBox version (emulates the DOS version in Windows)\nMDK3DFX.EXE = Glide native 3D card version\nMDK95.EXE = Win95 version\nMDK95FF.EXE = Win95 Force Feedback version\nMDKD3D.EXE = Direct 3D version\nMDKD3DFF.EXE = Direct 3D Force Feedback version\nMDKDOS.EXE = DOS version\nMDKPVR.EXE = PowerVR 3D card version\nMDKRED.EXE = Rendition Redline 3D card version\n\nAll executables are NoCD-Fixed!\n\n\nADHDerby","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0751e4be62009d8588442f1236cc659ac712d637","amp;dn":"MDK+Full+Rip+%2B+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0751e4be62009d8588442f1236cc659ac712d637","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,81,228,190,98,0,157,133,136,68,47,18,54,204,101,154,199,18,214,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
