After some substitutions the band got to its current lineup: Arash Sobhani (guitars and vocals), Anoush Khazeni (backing vocals and guitars), Babak Khiavchi (guitars), Ali Kamali (bass), Ardalan Payvar (keyboards), Shahrouz Molaei (drums), and Mardjan K (backing vocals). The main trait of Kiosk is using slangy, informal, and humorous language for their lyrics, which are mostly written by band mastermind Sobhani based on daily experiences and sociopolitical observations.\n\n\nArtist: Kiosk\nAlbum: Outcome of Negotiation\nReleased: Dec 01, 2011\nGenre: World, Jazz\nLanguage: Persian, English\nFormat: MP3\nBit Rate: VBR ~250 kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b5044f061d15c2e23161998b7041bd40cf01645","amp;dn":"Kiosk+-+Outcome+of+Negotiation+-+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b5044f061d15c2e23161998b7041bd40cf01645","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,80,68,240,97,209,92,46,35,22,25,152,183,4,27,212,12,240,22,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
