Again I found this to be an adult CD requiring a serious attempt at listening to be fully rewarded, again the result is a unique, ambitious and soulful interpretation of some contemporary blues and soulful songs with the trademark Wilson touch.  For those serious enough to step outside the square, this is for you .. and in spades as well!!!\nThe talent is again that *voice* and the interpretative touches she puts onto songs by Van Morrison, Joni Mitchell and Robert Johnson, as well as others, including her own compositions Redbone and Blue Light Til Dawn.  She is a maverick of the most interesting kind.  I could see the street lights flickering, the cats squelling the sirens sounding, the rubbish cans rattling, as I staggered home in the pre dawn hours .  . and that husky smoke laden delivery in my mind.  Come On In My Kitchen and Hellhound on My Trail are provocative .  . if you don't get a kick at listening to these .  . check your pulse  .  .  . you may be dead!!!!\n\nI think her interpretaion of I Can't Stand the Rain is excellent.  This song lends itself to a Wilson interpretation, more interesting than the commerically exploited version of Eruption in the disco laden 70's and the interesting treatment given to it by Ronnie Wood on one of his albums years later.  \n\nAs with the Miles Davis tribute, I found the muscianship excellent, with Ms Wilson showing her up front approach to a sparse and percussive accompaniment.  This truely is an excellent album, that requires to be given a number of listens before the true talent can be appreciated.  This will grow on you, and be played periodically from your collection, when the other commerically and talent limited divas have disappeared.  Turn off the lights, late at night and listen .  .  . you will be drifting between midnight and dawn .  . a classic sound from the evolving and maturing Ms Wilson.  4 1/2 to 5 stars, a worthy addition to your collection.  ~ Lance G .  Rigley\n\nRepeatedly unexpected.  Spare, care-ful arrangements, each specifically formulated for each song, each matching her rich, dark alto.  First and foremost, serious jazz, but also something entirely different, reflecting an eclectic song choice (e. g., Robert Johnson, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, Ann Peebles, herself).  Sometimes a primal awareness, but mainly a remarkable artistic sensibility.  She DEMANDS attention, completely remaking even old favorites into something totally new.  S: tr 2-Come on in my kitchen; tr 4-Children of the night, tr 5-Hellhound on my trail; tr 7-Sankofa; tr 10-Tupelo honey.  ~ Frank Camm\n\nPersonnel:\nCyro Baptista - percussion, jews harp\nCassandra Wilson - vocals\nKevin Johnson\nKenny Davis\nLonnie Plaxico - bass\nGib Wharton - pedal steel guitar\nCharlie Burnham - violin, mandocello\nTony Cedras - accordion\nJeff Haynes\nBill McClellan\nBrandon Ross\nLance Carter\nDon Byron\nOlu Dara\nChris Whitley\nVinx \n\nCassandra Wilson - Blue Light Till Dawn Tracks\n01  You Don't Know What Love Is\n02  Come On In My Kitchen\n03  Tell Me You'll Wait For Me\n04  Children Of The Night\n05  Hellhound On My Trail\n06  Black Crow\n07  Sankofa\n08  Estrellas\n09  Redbone\n10  Tupelo Honey\n11  Blue Light 'Til Dawn\n12  I Can't Stand The Rain","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75ae324a821879adf283350de596bfcd65bf3f99","amp;dn":"Cassandra+Wilson+-+Blue+Light+Till+Dawn+%281993%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75ae324a821879adf283350de596bfcd65bf3f99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,174,50,74,130,24,121,173,242,131,53,13,229,150,191,205,101,191,63,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
