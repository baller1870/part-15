Jeffords is a cattle baron who built his ranch, the Furies, from scratch. He borrows from banks, pays hired hands with his own script (&quot;T.C.'s&quot;), and carries on low-level warfare with the Mexicans who settled the land but are now considered squatters. He has enemies, including Rip Darrow, a saloon owner who's father T.C. took land from. His headstrong daughter, Vance, has a life-long friend in one of the Mexicans, her heart set on Rip, and dad's promise she'll run the Furies someday. Her hopes are smashed by Rip's revenge, a gold-digger who turns T.C.'s head, and T.C.'s own murderous imperialism. Is Vance to be cursed by fury and hatred?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54f329334f6e1645cdaa9eab031cba8381a9072c","amp;dn":"The+Furies++%28Western+1950%29++Barbara+Stanwyck%2C+Wendell+Corey+%26amp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54f329334f6e1645cdaa9eab031cba8381a9072c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,243,41,51,79,110,22,69,205,170,158,171,3,28,186,131,129,169,7,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
