As the always clear and direct Stein explains here, &quot;This is not a book of theory. It is a book of usable solutions--how to fix writing that is flawed, how to improve writing that is good, how to create interesting writing in the first place.&quot; With examples from bestsellers as well as from students' drafts, Stein offers detailed sections on characterization, dialogue, pacing, flashbacks, trimming away flabby wording, the so-called &quot;triage&quot; method of revision, using the techniques of fiction to enliven nonfiction, and more.\n\n\nAudiobook\nEncoding:  MP3\nQuality:   64kbit/s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81af1c6635742e5ba09c1ea230164e7cacf3c7eb","amp;dn":"Stein+on+Writing+-+Sol+Stein+%28Audiobook+-+MP3%2C+64kbit%2Fs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81af1c6635742e5ba09c1ea230164e7cacf3c7eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,175,28,102,53,116,46,91,160,156,30,162,48,22,78,124,172,243,199,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
