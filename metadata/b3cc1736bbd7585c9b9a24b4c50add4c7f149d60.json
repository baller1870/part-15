Although Lovecraft\nnever had a book published commercially in his lifetime, his stories\ndid feature in lurid magazines devoted to fantastic fiction that were\nprinted in the United States in the 1020s and 30s, such as &amp;#039;Weird Tales&amp;#039;\nof this biography&amp;#039;s title.  Geoff Ward, professor of literature at\nDundee University and presenter of this programme, argues a strong case\nfor Lovecraft as a writer who brought something very different to the\nhorror genre, both in his stylised writing and his desire to leave the\nreader in a dark place from scary start to frightening finish.  Other\ncontemporary fantasy writers, like Neil Garmain, back Ward up, with\nexquisite examples of how deliberately peculiar the author&amp;#039;s choice of\nadjectives was - &amp;#039;gibbous&amp;#039; being a particular favourite for a nearly\nfull moon.  But the most fascinating insights into his work come from\nthe realisation that it was the horrors in Lovecraft&amp;#039;s home life and a\nhellish upbringing that helped shape his fiction.\n\n3 MP3 files, 45m in total","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3cc1736bbd7585c9b9a24b4c50add4c7f149d60","amp;dn":"Weird+Tales+-+The+Strange+Life+Of+HP+Lovecraft+%28Documentary%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3cc1736bbd7585c9b9a24b4c50add4c7f149d60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,204,23,54,187,215,88,92,155,154,36,180,197,10,221,76,127,20,157,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
