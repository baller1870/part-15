Their remarkable reign saw England emerge from the Dark Ages to become a highly organised kingdom that spanned a vast expanse of Europe. Plantagenet rule saw the establishment of laws and creation of artworks, monuments and tombs which survive to this day, and continue to speak of their sophistication, brutality and secrets.\n\nDan Jones brings you a new vision of this battle-scarred history. From the Crusades, to King JohnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s humbling over Magna Carta and the tragic reign of the last Plantagenet, Richard II Ã¢â‚¬â€œ this is a blow-by-blow account of EnglandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most thrilling age.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Plantagenets-Kings-England-ebook/dp/B006I1CBUM/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373361429&amp;sr=8-1-fkmr1&amp;keywords=the+plantagenets+the+kings+who+made+england&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Plantagenets-Kings-England-ebook/dp/B006I1CBUM/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373361429&amp;sr=8-1-fkmr1&amp;keywords=the+plantagenets+the+kings+who+made+england&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b826026f77fa3739f071e6c3d1e03e1ecbf975a7","amp;dn":"The+Plantagenets%3A+The+Kings+Who+Made+England","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b826026f77fa3739f071e6c3d1e03e1ecbf975a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,38,2,111,119,250,55,57,240,113,230,195,209,224,62,30,203,249,117,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
