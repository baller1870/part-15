Watch a sample video and you'll see that Steven Tomlinson is one of our very best professors, and that his ability to make economics clear and relevant will make sure you're ready for tomorrow's Econ class at school. It's an amazing study aid, and because it's available night or day for one fixed price, it's better than a tutor.\n\nMost colleges offer microeconomics and macroeconomics as one-semester courses. Some colleges present economics as a survey course covering microeconomics and macroeconomics topics but lasting only one semester. At least one semester in economics is recommended for a college-prep curriculum.\n\nOur complete Economics package includes:\n- Printed Notes (optional) are the Economics course notes from the Online Subscription, but in a printed, on-the-go format\n- CD Set (optional) contains all of the video lessons so that you can watch them when you're away from the internet.\n\nFeatures:\n- More than 180 educational video lessons (see sample)\n- 1000+ interactive macroeconomics exercises with immediate feedback allow you to track your progress (see sample)\n- Printable illustrated notes for each topic\n- Glossary of more than 200 macroeconomics terms\n\nASIN: 1605380091\nPlatform:      Windows, Mac, Linux, Unix\nMedia: Software\nSource:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thinkwell.com/student/product/economics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thinkwell.com/student/product/economics&lt;/a&gt;\n\nadd those trackers to your torrent client to speed downloading: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=J2nhfYPb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=J2nhfYPb&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1c1213d2a9dcc63075e41d60665dd183e1639cf","amp;dn":"Thinkwell+Economics+%5BRiddleR.TK%5D+%28eLearning%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1c1213d2a9dcc63075e41d60665dd183e1639cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,193,33,61,42,157,204,99,7,94,65,214,6,101,221,24,62,22,57,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
