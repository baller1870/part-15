Success is a big thing that you can never plan for, because it affects everybody differently. I don't want to blame myself or \n\nanyone else in the band - it's just that the band didn't work any more. Rather than continuing on and making shitty records and having it \n\nall fall apart , I thought 'Let's just end it on a high point'&quot;.\n\nWhite Zombie was a Grammy Award-nominated American heavy metal band. Based in New York City, White Zombie was originally a noise rock \n\nband. White Zombie are better-known for their later heavy metal-oriented sound. The group officially disbanded in 1998.
