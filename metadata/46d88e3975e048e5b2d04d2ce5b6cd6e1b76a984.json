It received supreme critical acclaim for the screenplay by Arthur Hopcraft, the star Alex Guinness and the camerawork of Tony Pierce-Roberts.\n\nIn Alex Guinness&amp;#039;s first major TV role he plays George Smiley, a retired agent who is secretly brought into &quot;the Circus&quot; (the code name for British Secret Intelligent Service) to root out a top-level mole. Gradually piecing together the story, the weary but determined Smiley trawls through the murky waters of Cold War espionage and his own past.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46d88e3975e048e5b2d04d2ce5b6cd6e1b76a984","amp;dn":"LE_CARRE_TINKER_TAYLOR_SOLDIER_SPY_DISC2_DVD5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46d88e3975e048e5b2d04d2ce5b6cd6e1b76a984","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,216,142,57,117,224,72,229,178,208,77,44,229,182,205,110,27,118,169,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
