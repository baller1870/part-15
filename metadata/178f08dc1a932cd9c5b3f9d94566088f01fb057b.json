The album reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and number three on the Billboard 200 chart. Despite some criticisms towards the track listing by fans, and by Axl Rose and ex-Guns N' Roses members, who filed a joint lawsuit to try to prevent the release of the album, the album has proven a popular seller, selling 5 million copies in the United States to date. Greatest Hits became Guns N' Roses' second-longest charting album in their homeland (after Appetite for Destruction), finally dropping out of the chart in November 2006 following a 138-week stay but re-entered at 132 on the Billboard 200 chart on December 4, 2009. \n\nPlease SEED for others to Enjoy!\nCheers, Bubanee\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                    Guns N Roses - Greatest Hits\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Guns N Roses\nAlbum................: Greatest Hits\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2004\nRipper...............: dBpoweramp\nCodec................: LAME 3.98.4\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 260kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: ID3 v2.3\nInformation..........: \n\nRipped by............: Bubanee\nPosted by............: \nNews Server..........: \nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: NFO - Cov - CD\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
