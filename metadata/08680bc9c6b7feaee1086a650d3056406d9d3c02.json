Beyond simply obeying laws, this book focuses on leading an aggressively dynamic life, giving examples of proper and improper attitudes, conduct, and characteristics in succinct, penetrating ways. A proverb can be thought of as ''a short sentence from long experience''; it is easy to remember, yet it condenses much wisdom into a small space. \r\n\r\n''All Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable'' in four ways: for doctrine - whats right; for reproof - whats not right; for correction - how to get right; and for instruction in righteousness - how to stay right (2 Timothy 3:16). This book touches on all four of these. \r\n\r\nThis study contains 8 hours of verse by verse teachings","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08680bc9c6b7feaee1086a650d3056406d9d3c02","amp;dn":"The+Bible+Series+-+Chuck+Missler+-+The+Book+of+Proverbs+%287%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08680bc9c6b7feaee1086a650d3056406d9d3c02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,104,11,201,198,183,254,174,225,8,106,101,13,48,86,64,109,157,60,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
