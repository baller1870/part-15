It takes an unflinching and revealing look at what it\nactually took to be a jazz diva during a turbulent time in AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s social\nhistory Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a time when battle lines were being constantly drawn around issues\nof race, gender and popular culture.\n\nThe documentary tracks the jazz divaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s difficult progress as she emerges from\nthe tough, testosterone-fuelled world of the Big Bands of the Thirties and\nForties, to fill nightclubs and saloons across the US in the Fifties and early\nSixties as a force in her own right. Looking at the lives and careers of\nsix singers - Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, Sarah Vaughan,\nNina Simone and Annie Ross - the film talks to those who knew and worked with\nthese Queens of Jazz. It also hears from contemporary singers who sit on the\nshoulders of these trailblazing talents without having to endure the pain and\nhardship it took for them to make their highly individual voices heard above\nthe prejudice of mid-century America.\n\nThis is a documentary about how these women triumphed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ always at some personal\ncost Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to become some of the greatest artists of the 20th century, women who\nchose singing above life itself because singing was their life.\n\nContributors to the programme include singers Annie Ross, Lisa Stansfield,\nMelody Gardot, Diana Krall, Madeleine Peroux, Claire Martin, Barb Jungr,\nCarleen Anderson, Tina May, Gregory Porter; Big Band veterans Bucky Pizzarelli,\nBob Dorough; critics Gary Giddins, Dave Gelly, Alvin Hall, Loren Schoenberg,\nHolly Foster Wells, George Wein and Michael Bourne.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgbox.com/tmTIS3uH&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgbox.com/tmTIS3uH&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFORMAT:.......................: MP4/MPEG-4\nFULLSIZE:.....................: 493 MiB\nRESOLUTION:...................: 720*398=16:9\nFRAME RATE:...................: 25.000 fps\nAUDIO AAC:....................: 128 Kbps\nCHANNELS:.....................: 2[Stereo]\nLANGUAGE:.....................: English\nSUBTITLES:....................: NONE\nRUNTIME:......................: 59mn 37s\nENCODER:......................: oneanight\n\n\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eeb8488959d81f121d1d7073aae1d348d2748829","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Queens+of+Jazz+-+Jazz+Divas+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eeb8488959d81f121d1d7073aae1d348d2748829","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,184,72,137,89,216,31,18,29,29,112,115,170,225,211,72,210,116,136,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
