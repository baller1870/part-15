Showing how the hospice experience can profoundly touch the lives of the incarcerated, both those nearing death, and those who may find a measure of redemption in caring for inmate patients.In 2005, the Iowa State Penitentiary created a hospice program funded by private donations and prisoner contributions. Two infirmary rooms were set aside for terminally ill prisoners and set up by six inmate volunteers, all serving life sentences, who were specially trained to care for the dying. Director of nursing Marilyn Sales calls the hospice unit Ã¢â‚¬Å“a labor of loveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for inmate volunteers, who work five days a week, ten hours a day caring for patients.Filmed with unrestricted access over the course of six months, PRISON TERMINAL follows Jack Hall and the hospice volunteers who care for him. One prisoner volunteer says he feels good helping others, noting, Ã¢â‚¬Å“For once, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m somebody that nobody thought I could be.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Likewise, the experience can have a deep impact on the ill prisoner. Don Skinner, HallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s once-estranged son, visits him in prison throughout the final days of his life and believes the prison caregivers have changed his father. Ã¢â‚¬Å“It's you guys that have shown the compassion to my dad,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Skinner says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“And my dad ain't the guy he used to be\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s29.postimg.org/9brkji6yv/documentary_su_HBO_Prison_Terminal_The_Last_Days.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s29.postimg.org/9brkji6yv/documentary_su_HBO_Prison_Terminal_The_Last_Days.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c1e2bf9b6c644841c1dbd8c94dcbe6e19b80594","amp;dn":"HBO+Prison+Terminal-The+Last+Days+of+Private+Jack+Hall","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c1e2bf9b6c644841c1dbd8c94dcbe6e19b80594","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,30,43,249,182,198,68,132,28,29,189,140,148,220,190,110,25,184,5,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
