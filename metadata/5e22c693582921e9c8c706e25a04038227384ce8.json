Miles felt an affinity toward\nJohnson; not only because Miles himself boxed, but because of\nthe racial issues of being a Black man in America both men\nfaced. Director William Clayton made a documentary movie\nabout Johnson's life. A Tribute To Jack Johnson is the\nsoundtrack to the film. The album was released in the summer\nof 1971.\n\nA Tribute To Jack Johnson was a continuation of Miles' musical\ndirection away from more traditional jazz forms. The densely\nlayered music of Bitches Brew, recorded in August of 1969, was\nstripped down and became funkier and more groove oriented.\nThe music also incorporated more elements of rock with the\nguitar work of John McLaughlin. For listeners whose only Miles\nDavis recording is Kind Of Blue and want to hear some &quot;electric\nMiles,&quot; The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions may be the\nstarting point to work your way backward, as well as forward,\nthrough the Miles Davis catalog.\n\nDisc One: February-March 1970\n\n\nDisc One begins with five takes of the song &quot;Willie Nelson,&quot;\nwhich was released on the Directions album. The song is\nnamed after the country singer. Miles loved Willie's singing; he\nthought that his behind-the-beat phrasing resembled the way\nthat he played trumpet. Although the various takes of &quot;Willie\nNelson&quot; have differences in tempo and the amount of time Miles\nand the other soloists play, the real evolution of the piece is\nshown in Jack DeJohnette's drumming. He continuously\nincreases the complexity of his patterns. What started out as\nsimple timekeeping on the early takes later becomes highly\nsyncopated and intensely propulsive with constant rhythmic\nvariations.\n\nThe unedited takes also reveal guitarist Sonny Sharrock's\npresence on the sessions. His appearance along with John\nMcLaughlin marks the first time that Miles used two guitar\nplayers. Pianist Chick Corea uses an Echoplex (a tape driven\ndelay) on his electric piano, and Sharrock uses one on his\nguitar as well. At times it is difficult to distinguish between the\ntwo of them. This may have factored in SharrockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s playing on\nthe track being questioned at one time.\n\nAlong with Jack Johnson, the box set contains a series of tracks\nthat are named after other boxers. The first is &quot;Johnny Bratton.&quot;\nThe first take has shades of the Lifetime version of\nMcLaughlin's &quot;One Word&quot; (from Turn It Over ), in part due to\nMcLaughlin's chord voicings and DeJohnette sounding [a little]\nlike Tony Williams. The second take sounds like a band of\nteenagers practicing in the basement on Saturday morning.\nMiles at the end of the take says, &quot;I couldn't even play on that\ndeal.&quot; The third take has a slower tempo and a funkier feel,\nwhich gives Miles something to sink his teeth into. However, the\nrepetitive pattern starts to wear after awhile.\n\nThe last track, named after boxer Archie Moore, is an\nunexpected surprise featuring John McLaughlin playing a\nstraight-up blues! McLaughlin may play bluesy sometimes, but\nit's rare that you hear him play like this. The take has no horns:\njust guitar, bass, and drums. John is on this one like white on\nrice. This is a real treat for McLaughlin fans!\n\nPERSONNEL\n\nMiles Davis - Trumpet; John McLaughlin, Sonny Sharrock -\nGuitar; Michael Henderson, Dave Holland, Ron Carter, Gene\nPerla - Bass; Billy Cobham, Jack DeJohnette - Drums; Chick\nCorea, Keith Jarrett, Herbie Hancock - Keyboards; Steve\nGrossman, Wayne Shorter - Saxophone; Bennie Maupin - Bass\nClarinet; Airto- Percussion; Hermeto Pascoal - Vocals\n\n\n\n   1.
