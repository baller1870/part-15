Providing a comprehensive synthesis and review of the latest research findings in the biology of aging, it is intended as a summary for researchers, and is also suitable as a high level textbook for graduate and upper level undergraduate courses.  The 7th edition is organized into two main sections, first covering the basic aging processes and then the medical physiology of aging.  This puts less emphasis on research germane only to specific species and more emphasis on the mechanisms that affect aging across species, and what this means medically for the aging of humans.  This volume allows basic researchers to keep abreast of basic research outside their subdiscipline as well as recent clinical  findings, while allowing medical, behavioral, and social gerontologists to understand what basic scientists and clinicians are discovering.\n\nCoverage of basic aging processes includes the effects of dietary restriction, somatotropic axis, free radicals, apoptosis, adipose tissue, stem cells, leukocyte telomere dynamics, genetics, sirtuins, inflammation, and protein homeostasis on aging.  Coverage of the medical physiology of aging includes several chapters on aging effects on the human brain including changes in brain myelination, cerebral microvasculature, and cerebral vascular dysfunction.    Additional chapters include research on aging pulmonary function, insulin secretion, thermoreception and thermoregulation, calorie restriction, frailty &amp; mortality, and sex differences in longevity and aging.  This more clinically-oriented section advances our understanding  of what to expect, how to prevent, and how to treat common medical effects of aging.\n\nThe Handbook of the Biology of Aging, 7e is part of the Handbooks of Aging series, including Handbook of the Psychology of Aging and Handbook of Aging and the Social Sciences, also in their 7th editions.\n\n\n    * Contains basic aging processes as determined by animal research as well as medical physiology of aging as known in humans\n\n    * Covers hot areas of research, like stem cells, integrated with longstanding areas of interest in aging like telomeres, mitochondrial function, etc.\n\n    * Edited by one of the fathers of gerontology (Masoro) and contributors represent top scholars in gerintology\n\n\n\n\n# Paperback: 520 pages\n# Publisher: Academic Press; 7 edition (November 30, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 012378638X\n# ISBN-13: 978-0123786388","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3011c1e0a63dbf9430d6457ca38dc8b1de3a3ae1","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+the+Biology+of+Aging+7th+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3011c1e0a63dbf9430d6457ca38dc8b1de3a3ae1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,17,193,224,166,61,191,148,48,214,69,124,163,141,200,177,222,58,58,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
