When terminal is processing the video, you can start another\nYou can repair many video in same time. Depending of the file size, it can take all resources so your computer specifications.\n\nWarning:\n\nyou have only 1 or 2 mins to perform the drop after creating the log. Afterwards it expires and you have to do  again the scan.\n\nImprovements:\n\n- the script can be process in background for better fluidity(I'm not too good to do that)\n\n- logfile expires minutes after its creations. I could find where but there must be a line to define the duration.\n\nBut the best solution \n\n-  video tool repair creates a simple line useful to repair the video. If we can understand how the key is created, we can throw away this software, that is only an interface, and only work the &quot; movdump&quot;, the actual software that fixes the video.\n\nAnyone keen to accept this job\n\nI&quot;ll be grateful \n\n\n\nEnjoy !!!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc49d4f9d32b90a710a046d2fad69979525f2ac1","amp;dn":"videorepair+%2B+script","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc49d4f9d32b90a710a046d2fad69979525f2ac1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,73,212,249,211,43,144,167,16,160,70,210,250,214,153,121,82,95,42,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
