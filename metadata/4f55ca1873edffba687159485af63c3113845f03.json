S. Lewis, first published in book form in 1942. The story takes the form of a series of letters from a senior demon, Screwtape, to his nephew, a junior tempter named Wormwood, so as to advise him on methods of securing the damnation of a British man, known only as &quot;the Patient&quot;.\n\nLewis dedicated The Screwtape Letters to his friend J. R. R. Tolkien.\n\nIn The Screwtape Letters, C.S. Lewis provides a series of lessons in the importance of taking a deliberate role in living out Christian faith by portraying a typical human life, with all its temptations and failings, as seen from devils' viewpoints. Screwtape holds an administrative post in the bureaucracy (&quot;Lowerarchy&quot;) of Hell, and acts as a mentor to Wormwood, the inexperienced tempter. In the body of the thirty-one letters which make up the book, Screwtape gives Wormwood detailed advice on various methods of undermining faith and promoting sin in the Patient, interspersed with observations on human nature and Christian doctrine. Wormwood and Screwtape live in a peculiarly morally reversed world, where individual benefit and greed are seen as the greatest good, and neither demon is capable of comprehending or acknowledging true human virtue when he sees it.\n\nVersions of the letters were originally published in The Guardian, and the standard edition contains an introduction explaining how the author chose to write his story.\n\nThe Screwtape Letters is one of Lewis' most popular works, although Lewis claimed that it was &quot;not fun&quot; to write, and &quot;resolved never to write another 'Letter'.&quot; (See his Preface to Screwtape Proposes a Toast.) However, in 1959 he wrote the sequel, Screwtape Proposes a Toast.\n\nBoth The Screwtape Letters and Screwtape Proposes a Toast have been released on both audio cassette and CD, with narration by John Cleese and Joss Ackland.\n\nMore About The Book\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Screwtape_Letters&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Screwtape_Letters\n\nAbout The Author\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis\n\nTorrent also inclused .txt file of the book, neither check, nor made by me.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f55ca1873edffba687159485af63c3113845f03","amp;dn":"Audio+Book+%3A+C.+S.+Lewis+-+Screwtape+Letters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f55ca1873edffba687159485af63c3113845f03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,85,202,24,115,237,255,186,104,113,89,72,90,246,60,49,19,132,95,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
