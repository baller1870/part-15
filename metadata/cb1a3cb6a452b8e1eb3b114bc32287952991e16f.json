This season features the best animation (drawing) quality of all.\n At some points you may just want to hit pause and look at the picture.\n A pity we won't see anything like this again - Season 7 will have simplyfied art.\n\n Thanks to:\n   MaMaDx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb1a3cb6a452b8e1eb3b114bc32287952991e16f","amp;dn":"TMNT_2003_Season_01_x264_AAC_DVDRip_by_LRN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb1a3cb6a452b8e1eb3b114bc32287952991e16f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,26,60,182,164,82,184,225,235,59,17,75,195,34,135,149,41,145,225,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
