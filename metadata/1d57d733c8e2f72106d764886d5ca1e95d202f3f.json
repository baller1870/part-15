Emma Edmonds cut off her hair and assumed the identity of a man to enlist as a Union private, witnessing the bloodiest battles of the Civil War. The beautiful widow, Rose OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Neale Greenhow, engaged in affairs with powerful Northern politicians to gather intelligence for the Confederacy, and used her young daughter to send information to Southern generals. Elizabeth Van Lew, a wealthy Richmond abolitionist, hid behind her proper Southern manners as she orchestrated a far-reaching espionage ring, right under the noses of suspicious rebel detectives.\n\nUsing a wealth of primary source material and interviews with the spiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ descendants, Abbott seamlessly weaves the adventures of these four heroines throughout the tumultuous years of the war. With a cast of real-life characters including Walt Whitman, Nathaniel Hawthorne, General Stonewall Jackson, detective Allan Pinkerton, Abraham and Mary Todd Lincoln, and Emperor Napoleon III, Liar, Temptress, Soldier, Spy draws you into the war as these daring women lived it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d57d733c8e2f72106d764886d5ca1e95d202f3f","amp;dn":"Liar%2C+Temptress%2C+Soldier%2C+Spy+-+Karen+Abbott","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d57d733c8e2f72106d764886d5ca1e95d202f3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,87,215,51,200,226,247,33,6,215,100,136,109,92,161,233,93,32,47,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
