Python &amp; XML provides you with a solid foundation for using these two languages together. Loaded with practical examples, the book highlights common application tasks, so that you can learn by doing. The book starts with the basics then quickly progresses to complex topics, like transforming XML with XSLT, querying XML with XPath, and working with XML dialects and validation. It also covers the more advanced issues, such as SOAP and distributed web services, and explores the use of Python to create scalable XML streams between distributed applications. If you are a Python programmer who wants to incorporate XML into your skill set, this is the book for you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:493c76b2b8c5cabb3ee1d61909f2d8d05484381a","amp;dn":"Python+%26+XML","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"493c76b2b8c5cabb3ee1d61909f2d8d05484381a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,60,118,178,184,197,202,187,62,225,214,25,9,242,216,208,84,132,56,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
