A formidable boogie and blues pianist with a lovable growl of a voice, his most enduring achievements have fused New Orleans R&amp;B, rock, and Mardi Gras craziness to come up with his own brand of &quot;voodoo&quot; music. He's also quite accomplished and enjoyable when sticking to purely traditional forms of blues and R&amp;B. On record, he veers between the two approaches, making for an inconsistent and frequently frustrating legacy that often makes the listener feel as if the &quot;Night Tripper&quot; (as he's nicknamed himself) has been underachieving. ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:wifwxqe5ldhe~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:wifwxqe5ldhe~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAlbum Review:\n\nHaving cut an album of standards on his first Warner Brothers album, In a Sentimental Mood (1989), Dr. John turned for its follow-up to a collection of New Orleans standards. On an album he described in the liner notes as &quot;a little history of New Orleans music,&quot; Dr. John returned to his hometown and set up shop at local Ultrasonic Studios, inviting in such local musicians as Pete Fountain, Al Hirt, and the Neville Brothers and addressing the music and styles of such local legends as Jelly Roll Morton, Huey &quot;Piano&quot; Smith, Fats Domino, James Booker, and Professor Longhair. The geography may have been circumscribed, but the stylistic range was extensive, from jazz and blues to folk and rock. And it was all played with festive conviction -- Dr. John is the perfect archivist for the music, being one of its primary proponents, yet he had never addressed it quite as directly as he did here.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:avfrxqr5ldte&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:avfrxqr5ldte&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
