The music from the Coen brothers' Depression-era film taps into the source from which the purest strains of country, blues, bluegrass, folk, and gospel music flow. Producer T Bone Burnett enlists the voices of Alison Krauss, Gillian Welch, Emmylou Harris, Ralph Stanley, and kindred spirits for performances of traditional material, in arrangements that are either a cappella or feature bare-bones accompaniment. Highlights range from the aching purity of Krauss's &quot;Down to the River to Pray&quot; to the plainspoken faith of the Whites' &quot;Keep on the Sunny Side&quot; to Stanley's chillingly plaintive &quot;O Death.&quot; The album's spiritual centerpiece finds Krauss, Welch, and Harris harmonizing on &quot;Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby,&quot; a gospel lullaby that sounds like a chorus of Appalachian angels.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfbcc10c1110dac262a00c169a6ac05a41b3d2ca","amp;dn":"%5B2000%5D+O+Brother%2C+Where+Art+Thou%3F+%5BOST%5D+-+%7BCDRip+-+flac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfbcc10c1110dac262a00c169a6ac05a41b3d2ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,188,193,12,17,16,218,194,98,160,12,22,154,106,192,90,65,179,210,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
