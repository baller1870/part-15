But Dr. Seuss' stories are more than just catchy poems; they often wrestle with serious philosophical and moral dilemmas, whether it is Horton discovering the very essence of life or the Lorax teaching us about morality. Dr. Seuss and Philosophy explores philosophical concepts such as the nature of the good life in Oh, the Places You'll Go!, the nature of knowledge in McElligot's Pool, postmodernity in On Beyond Zebra, business and the environment in The Lorax, and moral character in How the Grinch Stole Christmas!, among many others. Anyone who loves Dr. Seuss or is interested in philosophy will find this book to be intriguing and enlightening","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c039273768346a699ebecabe4e69b69fda1c1a5d","amp;dn":"Dr.+Seuss+and+Philosophy+-+Jacob+M.Held","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c039273768346a699ebecabe4e69b69fda1c1a5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,57,39,55,104,52,106,105,158,190,202,190,78,105,182,159,218,28,26,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
