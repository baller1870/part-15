The book is an\ninsider's behind-the-scenes look at the arcane, fascinating\nworld of theoretical and experimental particle physics\nleading up to the recent discovery of a new boson. If the\nnew boson is indeed the Higgs particle, its discovery\nrepresents an important milestone in the history of particle\nphysics. However, despite the pressure to award Nobel Prizes\nto physicists associated with the Higgs boson, John Moffat\nargues that there still remain important data analyses to be\nperformed before uncorking the champagne.\n\nCracking the Particle Code of the Universe\nby John Moffat\nPages: 628\nFormat: EPUB\nLanguage:EN","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4cee7305e568dd9a50176baa617c7489dff1465","amp;dn":"Cracking+the+Particle+Code+of+the+Universe+by+John+Moffat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4cee7305e568dd9a50176baa617c7489dff1465","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,206,231,48,94,86,141,217,165,1,118,186,166,23,199,72,157,255,20,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
