Run the office.exe file\n2. A black command panel will popup, leave it for at-least 15 minutes if not less\n3. The office setup window will launch and THEN CLOSE (THIS IS NORMAL!)\n4. The command panel will dissappear once installation is complete (no serial required!) and Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise\n   is now installed, check Start&gt;All Programs&gt;Microsoft Office (the whole suite is installed)\n5. ENJOY!\n\nTHERE IS NO NEED FOR A SERIAL NUMBER AND THERE NEVER WILL BE! UPDATE FOR AS LONG AS YOU WANT!\n\nNOTE: this is a silent installer, as in there is NO progression feedback of installation. Just be patient and it will install in the background and terminate once finished\n\nPlease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:094c68d980a52dea01bc39883f519fc06ce738e1","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Office+2007+Enterprise+by+Lee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"094c68d980a52dea01bc39883f519fc06ce738e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,76,104,217,128,165,45,234,1,188,57,136,63,81,159,192,108,231,56,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
