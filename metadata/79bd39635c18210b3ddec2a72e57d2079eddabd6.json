They have also described the range of simulation options and the contexts for their most effective use.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Gloria F. Donnelly, PhD, RN, FAAN, FCPP, Dean and Professor\n\nCollege of Nursing and Health Professions, Drexel University\n\nHealth professionals embarking on a career teaching simulation are embracing a world of innovation in which both teacher and student can develop their healthcare skills more rapidly and promote better patient outcomes. This is the first practice manual to assist healthcare simulation educators in the United States and internationally in preparing for certification in this rapidly emerging field. The authors, noted experts in simulation and education, have carefully analyzed the CHSE blueprint to ascertain what material is most likely to be covered. They present this information in a user-friendly, pithy outline format.\n\nThis review manual provides numerous features that help students to critically analyze test content, including end-of-chapter review questions, test-taking strategies, and a comprehensive practice test with answers and rationales. It features current evidence-based teaching practices and incorporates case studies to connect simulation Ã¢â‚¬Å“situationsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to simulation education with healthcare students and includes information about advanced certification and recertification.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Comprises the first review book for the CHSE exam\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Follows the CHSE test blueprint\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fosters optimal learning and retention through use of a pithy outline format\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Provides Teaching Tips feature for best simulation practice\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Includes Evidence-Based Simulation Practice boxes that focus on current research\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Incorporates case studies, 230+ test questions, end-of-chapter practice questions, and test-taking strategies\n\nThe Certified Healthcare Simulation Educator and CHSE marks are trademarks of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare.\n\nThis manual is an independent publication and is not endorsed, sponsored, or otherwise approved by the Society","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79bd39635c18210b3ddec2a72e57d2079eddabd6","amp;dn":"Review+Manual+for+the+CHSE+Exam%2C+Wilson+%5BPDF%5D%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79bd39635c18210b3ddec2a72e57d2079eddabd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,189,57,99,92,24,33,11,61,222,194,167,46,87,210,7,158,221,171,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
