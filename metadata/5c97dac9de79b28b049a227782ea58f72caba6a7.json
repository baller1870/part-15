Michael Clark uncovers an array of conundrums, such as Achilles and the Tortoise, Theseus' Ship, and the Prisoner's Dilemma, taking in subjects as diverse as knowledge, science, art and politics. Clark discusses each paradox in non-technical terms, considering its significance and looking at likely solutions. \n\nThis third edition is revised throughout, and adds nine new paradoxes that have important bearings in areas such as law, logic, ethics and probability. Paradoxes from A to Z, Third edition is an ideal starting point for those interested not just in philosophical puzzles and conundrums, but anyone seeking to hone their thinking skills.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://books.google.com/books?isbn=0415538572&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://books.google.com/books?isbn=0415538572&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/677862.Paradoxes_from_A_to_Z&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/677862.Paradoxes_from_A_to_Z&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c97dac9de79b28b049a227782ea58f72caba6a7","amp;dn":"Paradoxes+from+A+to+Z+%283e%29+-+Michael+Clark.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c97dac9de79b28b049a227782ea58f72caba6a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,151,218,201,222,121,178,139,4,154,34,119,130,234,88,247,44,171,166,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
