It's a bit of a mixed bag, but all the disparate ingredients for a satisfying whole. There are simple, catchy rock tunes like &quot;Wind Up Workin' in a Gas Station,&quot; &quot;Ms. Pinky,&quot; a synth-led ode to a sexual toy, and &quot;Disco Boy,&quot; which foreshadowed Zappa's hit &quot;Dancing Fool.&quot; The lovely instrumental &quot;Black Napkins&quot; is among the prettiest compositions in Zappa's canon, highlighting his guitar work in an uncharacteristically restrained mode. The arguable centerpiece of the album is the epic-length &quot;The Torture Never Stops.&quot; Sung by Zappa in his deepest, dirtiest, most ominous voice, the song recounts the tale of an evil monarch who does unspeakable things in the depths of his castle. Full of Zappa's bluesy guitar interjections, its one of the most deliciously unsavory things FZ ever committed to tape.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
