While all of us are very different from each other, one could surely say that in some senses, we're fairly similar too. Three Seasons is a mash-up of our thoughts, minds and bodies, together forming sounds possibly reminding of bands and musicians such as Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, Black Sabbath, Free, Gov't Mule, Mountain and Santana.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38440a06812bf09a73f81d4d1efab0cd17963585","amp;dn":"Three+Seasons+-+Life%5C%27s+Road+%282011%29+%5Bmp3%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38440a06812bf09a73f81d4d1efab0cd17963585","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,68,10,6,129,43,240,154,115,248,29,77,30,250,176,205,23,150,53,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
