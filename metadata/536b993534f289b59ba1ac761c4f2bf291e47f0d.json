But every four years, a strange madness compels the town's teenagers to commit terrible crimes. Four years ago, Skylar's sister, Piper, led her classmates on a midnight death march into a watery grave. Now Piper is gone. And to get her back, Skylar must find a way to end Gardnerville's murderous cycle.\n\nFrom Kate Karyus Quinn, author of Another Little Piece, comes a mesmerizing and suspenseful novel that will thrill fans of Maggie Stiefvater's The Raven Boys and Brenna Yovanoff's The Replacement.\n\n\n\nFrom School Library Journal\n\nGr 8 UpÃ¢â‚¬â€Skylar lives in a purple haze. Ever since her beloved older sister, Piper, led a group of local teenagers to their death, she's been trying to forget her life by swallowing pills. Skylar lives in Gardnerville, a creepy town where no one gets sick and everyone lives well into their second century. Well, almost everyone. Teenagers between the ages of 14 and 18 are susceptible to violence and when they snap, they're punished in the reformatory. That's what happened to Piper and that's what Skylar fears will happen to her. But Skylar is not like other Gardnerville teens. She has an inexplicable power; a power so strong that she could destroy the town, the reformatory, even herself, anything to find her sister. Readers expecting a fast-paced plot won't necessarily find it here. Rather, they'll need to take their time following Skylar's drug-induced narration in order to see how all the pieces come together. Even though readers are inside her head, it's hard to know what truly drives Skylar other than her obsession with finding out what happened to Piper. Fans of Nova Ren Suma's Imaginary Girls (Dutton, 2011) will enjoy this dark and magical surrealism.Ã¢â‚¬â€Kimberly Garnick Giarratano, Rockaway Township Public Library, NJ\n\nFrom Booklist\n\nSkylar lives in Gardnerville, a paradise where people age slowly, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get sick, and rarely die. Every fourth year, however, tragedy strikes in townÃ¢â‚¬â€tragedies that are usually sparked by any intense emotions in the teens of the city. Four years ago, SkylarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s older sister, Piper, led half the teens in the city through town in the middle of the night to jump off a trestle bridge into the river below. Many teens drowned that night. The ones that didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, including Piper, were hauled off to the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Reformatory, a home for troubled children. Leaping back and forth in time, Skylar narrates chilling discoveries, sometimes speaking directly to her missing sister. When Skylar isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t searching for ways to help Piper escape the Reformatory, she takes drugs to forget about her townÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tragedies and her familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s role in them. QuinnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s newest mystery is a complicated thriller with lots of twists, turns, and a large dose of fantasy. This title would appeal to fans of stories with odd time lines or a menacing tone","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:536b993534f289b59ba1ac761c4f2bf291e47f0d","amp;dn":"Don%27t+You+Forget+About+Me+-+Kate+Karyus+Quinn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"536b993534f289b59ba1ac761c4f2bf291e47f0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,107,153,53,52,242,137,181,155,161,172,118,28,79,43,242,145,228,127,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
