Ã¢â‚¬Å“When the buffalo went away the hearts of my people fell to the ground,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“and they could not lift them up again. After this nothing happened.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ It is precisely this pointÃ¢â‚¬â€that of a people faced with the end of their way of lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€that prompts the philosophical and ethical inquiry pursued in Radical Hope. In Jonathan LearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s view, Plenty CoupsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ story raises a profound ethical question that transcends his time and challenges us all: how should one face the possibility that oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s culture might collapse?\nThis is a vulnerability that affects us allÃ¢â‚¬â€insofar as we are all inhabitants of a civilization, and civilizations are themselves vulnerable to historical forces. How should we live with this vulnerability? Can we make any sense of facing up to such a challenge courageously? Using the available anthropology and history of the Indian tribes during their confinement to reservations, and drawing on philosophy and psychoanalytic theory, Lear explores the story of the Crow Nation at an impasse as it bears upon these questionsÃ¢â‚¬â€and these questions as they bear upon our own place in the world. His book is a deeply revealing, and deeply moving, philosophical inquiry into a peculiar vulnerability that goes to the heart of the human condition.\n\n===================================================================================\nEditorial Reviews\nFrom Publishers Weekly\nScholar and author Lear (Therapeutic Action: An Earnest Plea for Irony) decodes the courage and wisdom of the last great chief of the Crow peoples, Plenty Coups (1848-1932), in this &quot;philosophical anthropology&quot; which seeks to pin down the way societies-and the individuals who lead them-carry on in the face of &quot;cultural catastrophe.&quot; As a jumping-off point, Lear uses a quote from Plenty Coups's oral history, given to Frank B. Linderman shortly before the chief's death: &quot;But when the buffalo went away the hearts of my people fell to the ground... After this nothing happened.&quot; The first part of the book explores the meaning of &quot;nothing happened,&quot; explicating the idea that history itself comes to an end when the concepts a culture uses to define its world-in this case, concepts tied to hunting, battle, and honor-become obsolete. The second part tackles &quot;Ethics at the Horizon,&quot; the possibilities for &quot;radical hope&quot; in the face of inconceivable cultural change through courage, wisdom and flexibility, on both a personal and cultural level. The third part discusses the ramifications of &quot;radical hope,&quot; both practically and philosophically. Lear's study is probably too rigorous rhetorically to appeal to a wide audience, and his insistence that &quot;we live at a time of a heightened sense that civilizations are themselves vulnerable&quot; could have been supported with some explicit contemporary parallels, but for those interested in the final years of the Crow nation or the ethical challenges faced by victims of cultural destruction, this book will prove enlightening.\n\nFrom Booklist\nLear, a psychoanalyst and professor of philosophy, delves into what he calls the &quot;blind spot&quot; of any culture: the inability to conceive of its own devastation. He molds his thoughts around a poignant historical model, the decimated nation of Crow Indians in the early decades of the twentieth century. The last Crow chief, Plenty Coups, told his white friend and biographer, Frank B. Linderman, about what happened to his people &quot;when the buffalo went away.&quot; They were despondent, and in Plenty Coups' words, &quot;After this nothing happened.&quot; Lear dissects this phenomenon, and the Crows' struggle for continued survival, in a highly esoteric discussion drawing on the writings of Aristotle, Plato, and other philosophers. What makes this discussion relevant to mainstream readers is his application of the blind-spot hypothesis to the present, in which the twenty-first century was ushered in by terrorist attacks, social upheavals, and natural catastrophes, leaving us with &quot;an uncanny sense of menace&quot; and a heightened perception of how vulnerable our civilizations are to destruction, as was the Crow's. Deborah Donovan\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\nIn this very engaging book, Lear examines the cultural collapse of the tribe of Native Americans known as the Crow Nation. He describes his analysis as a form of philosophical anthropology, as he focuses on the tribe's thinking and how its members attempted to live when their values and lifestyle were being threatened. He begins by examining the importance of bravery, courage, and honor within the tribe's culture and how these values were tested when the Crow were forced to abandon their warrior lifestyle and move onto a reservation. Their chief, Plenty Coups, inspired the Crow to use what Lear describes as &quot;imaginative excellence&quot; by trying to imagine what ethical values would be needed in their new lifestyle. Plenty Coups did this with a combination of such traditional sources as dream interpretation and past ethical values, which gave the Crow an opportunity to overcome their despair and lead a meaningful life. In his analysis, Lear creatively uses philosophical ideas to explain what it must have been like for the Crow to make this radical change. (Scott Duimstra Library Journal 2006-07-01)\n\nFor those interested in the final years of the Crow nation or the ethical challenges faced by victims of cultural destruction, this book will prove enlightening. (Publishers Weekly 2006-09-11)\n\nLear, a psychoanalyst and professor of philosophy, delves into what he calls the &quot;blind spot&quot; of any culture: the inability to conceive of its own devastation. He molds his thoughts around a poignant historical model, the decimated nation of Crow Indians in the early decades of the twentieth century...What makes this discussion relevant to mainstream readers is his application of the blind spot hypothesis to the present, in which the twenty-first century was ushered in by terrorist attacks, social upheavals, and natural catastrophes, leaving us with &quot;an uncanny sense of menace&quot; and a heightened perception of how vulnerable our civilizations are to destruction, as were the Crow. (Deborah Donovan Booklist 2006-08-01)\n\nThere is so much to learn here; Lear parses the differences between mere optimism and radical hope, as it is manifest in Plenty Coups' &quot;fidelity to his prophetic dream.&quot; It's one of those books you want to put in the hands of leaders the world over. (Susan Salter Reynolds Los Angeles Times Book Review 2006-10-01)\n\nA sustained meditation on cultural collapse, a brilliant, moving discussion of what it means to lose sense of one's existence without losing hope that existence makes sense. Lear's meditation centers on Plenty Coups, the last great chief of the Crow Nation, who watched, and in many ways directed, the transition from a nomadic hunting culture to one confined to reservations. Lear argues that he exhibited a special version of courage, an ironic and transcendental courage in the form of radical hope. His account opens up meaning for anyone, anywhere, who lives in and thinks about his or her world. (Mark Kingwell Globe and Mail 2006-11-25)\n\nJonathan Lear's latest book, Radical Hope: Ethics in the Face of Cultural Devastation consists in an inquiry, properly characterized as a form of philosophical anthropology, into &quot;a peculiar form of vulnerability&quot; that is arguably part of the human condition...The general problem, however, that he deals with has to do with what he calls the &quot;blind spot&quot; of any culture: the inability to conceive of its own destruction and possible extinction...I can only add my comments of well-deserved praise to an already long list of similar comments by illustrious commentators...Lear's book is not only a masterfully crafted and deeply moving narrative, but it also offers us a timely philosophical reflection that is highly relevant to our current condition at this juncture of history. Needless to say, we live in an age of deep and profound angst that the world itself, as we know it, is vulnerable and could break down...Lear may be right when he says that &quot;if we could give a name to our shared sense of vulnerability, perhaps we could find better ways to live with it.&quot; But, being naturally more pessimistically inclined, and therefore arguably more realistic, I sincerely doubt if this will suffice. (Nader N. Chokr Metapsychology 2007-01-16)\n\nLear's book breaks new ground, in an extremely interesting way...What do I take away from this short, illuminating book? My own version of radical hope, applied to very different circumstances...This is what makes Lear's well-written and philosophically sophisticated book so valuable. As a story of courage and moral imagination, it is very powerful and moving. But it also offers the kind of insights that would-be builders of 'new world order' desperately need. (Charles Taylor New York Review of Books 2007-04-26)\n\nA luminous book. (Michael Ignatieff New Republic 2007-10-08)\n\n[LearÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs] book exemplifies the best features of recent breakthrough works in philosophy: it is analytically rigorous, yet grounded in both history and anthropology, and open to world-views other than those safely ensconced in the Western academy...LearÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs account of cultural devastation serves as an important rejoinder to those constructions of society based on the beliefs of liberal individualism. (Luke Gibbons Field Day Review 2008-06-01)\n\nRadical Hope is a very rich and complicated repast that a reader can savor over and over again, discovering new insights with each reading. My review, in short, cannot do LearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book justice. (Ryan LaMothe Psychologist-Psychoanalyst 2007-09-01)\n\nThought-provoking and highly-recommended...As Lear points out, with the onset of reservation life it became increasingly problematic to define what a warrior was and there was no longer a clear sense of what it was to be outstanding as a chief. In a very real sense, LearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s observation holds true today. The tribal water quality specialist may do excellent work and the recipient of a tribal scholarship may be a top-notch student. They may also be aware of the tribeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history; participate in tribal ceremonies, and understand the importance of place in tribal culture. But neither understands how to constitute themselves as persons who need to internalize the ideals associated with those social roles for the benefit of the tribe...An examination of LearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book is an excellent starting point for those planning tribal workforce development programs. (Mervyn Tano International Institute for Indigenous Resource Management)\n\nDon't be alarmed by its grimly academic title; [Radical Hope: Ethics in the Face of Cultural Devastation] is one of the most profound and elegantly written books to come out in decades. The book discusses a Crow Indian leader named Plenty Coups, who led his people through their brutal transition from a nomadic hunting culture to confinement on a government reservation. This is not a work of history or anthropology, however, but an inquiry into how an entire society can radically transform itself in order to survive. Lear's book is visionary and--if you take its message to heart--transformative. He has done one of those rare things: produced a work that applies to literally every person on the planet. (Sebastian Junger Time 2010-07-12)\n\nHow does a nation come to life-and-death decisions at a time of crisis when it can no longer live according to its founding values? The strategic brilliance of Jonathan Lear's response to this deeply important question lies in focusing our attention on the exemplary history of the Crow people, and deploying the insights of psychoanalysis to interpret their struggle for survival. With admirable lucidity, in the most clear-cut language, he shows us that besides the glamorous alternatives of freedom or death there is a third way, less grand yet demanding just as much courage: the way of creative adaptation.
