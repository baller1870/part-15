The next thing he knows, a spa in Florida is reminding him of his appointment, and his credit cards are maxed out. With his identity stolen, Sandy leaves his wife, kids and job to literally bring the thief to justice in Colorado. But keeping tabs on the other Sandy (Melissa McCarthy) and run-ins with bounty hunters, is harder than he was expecting, and ultimately the cross-country trip is going to find both Sandys learning life tips from one another. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024432/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024432/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre: Comedy | Crime\niMDB Rating: 5,7/10 from 19 476 users\nDirector: Seth Gordon\nStarring: Jason Bateman, Melissa McCarthy, Amanda Peet\n\nSource Used: Identity Thief 2013 UNRATED 720p WEB-DL H264-PublicHD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2768afa0794d979d63cd88efebe53078602744d5","amp;dn":"Identity+Thief+2013+UNRATED+720p+WEBRip+x264-PLAYNOW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2768afa0794d979d63cd88efebe53078602744d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,104,175,160,121,77,151,157,99,205,136,239,235,229,48,120,96,39,68,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
