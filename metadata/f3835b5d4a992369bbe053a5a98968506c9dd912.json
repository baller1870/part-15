Hailed by the New York Times as Ã¢â‚¬Å“single-handedly responsible for whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been called the cocktail renaissance,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he earned this reputation during his twelve years at the fashionable Promenade Bar in New York CityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rainbow Room. It was there in 1987 that he not only reintroduced the cocktail menu to the country but also began mixing drinks from scratch, using impeccably fresh ingredients instead of the widespread mixes used at the time. Known especially for crafting unique cocktails, reviving classics, and coaxing superior flavor from his ingredients, DeGroff has selected his 100 essential drinks and 100 of their best variationsÃ¢â‚¬â€including many of his signature cocktailsÃ¢â‚¬â€for this premier mixology guide.\nThe Essential Cocktail features only those drinks that stand out for their flavor, interesting formula, or distinctive technique. These are the very ones every amateur and professional bartender must know, the martinis, sours, highballs, tropicals, punches, sweets, and classics, both old and new, that form the core of a connoisseurÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s repertoire. Throughout the book are DeGroffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal twists, such as a tangy Grapefruit Julep or a refreshing Yuzu Gimlet.\nTo complement the tantalizing photographs of each essential cocktail, DeGroff also regales readers with the fascinating lore behind a drinkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s genesis and instructs us on using the right ingredients, techniques, glasses, and garnishes. As Julia ChildÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mastering the Art of French Cooking was the classic compendium for home chefs and gourmands, so The Essential Cocktail will be the go-to book for serious mixologists and cocktail enthusiasts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3835b5d4a992369bbe053a5a98968506c9dd912","amp;dn":"The+Essential+Cocktail+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3835b5d4a992369bbe053a5a98968506c9dd912","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,131,91,93,74,153,35,105,187,224,83,165,169,137,104,80,108,157,217,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
