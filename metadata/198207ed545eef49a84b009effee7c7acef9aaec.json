Or a kite that lets you fly.\nEvery enemy has a weak spot you can hit, and enemies differ in their behavior. For example there is an enemy that will teleport every time you hit it, or enemy that leaves bombs that home on you, but you can shoot those bombs to push them onto your foes.&quot;\n\nIf you like the game, support the developer, buy it! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/307090/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/307090/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:198207ed545eef49a84b009effee7c7acef9aaec","amp;dn":"Fancy+Skulls+v0.7.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"198207ed545eef49a84b009effee7c7acef9aaec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,130,7,237,84,94,239,73,168,75,0,158,255,238,124,122,206,249,170,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
