Del finds himself designated as the courier between Holland and Britain.\nNo sooner has Del enlisted a reluctant Rodders, he hears his old foil Chief Inspector Slater is eyeing Boycie and Abdul as drug dealers. Del decides to hide undetected in the back of Denzil&amp;#039;s van.\nDenzil then getting in and driving them to Hull (pursued by Rodney) was not part of the plan. Thinking quickly, they hire a boat, and let Uncle Albert guide them to Amsterdam.\nOvercoming counterfeit cash, Albert&amp;#039;s amnesia, it&amp;#039;s only the arrival of Slater that scuppers them. Despite this, it&amp;#039;s Del who has the last laugh.\n\nEnjoy Please Seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb99a118283cfb358578130173dcde74a8cc977f","amp;dn":"Only+Fools+And+Horses-To+Hull+And+Back.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb99a118283cfb358578130173dcde74a8cc977f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,153,161,24,40,60,251,53,133,120,19,1,115,220,222,116,168,204,151,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
