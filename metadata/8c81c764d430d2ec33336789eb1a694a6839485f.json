Zombies and Bio-Organic Weapons (B.O.W's) add to the mix as players not only compete against an opposing squad but also tackle this third unpredictable element, creating a brand new style of gameplay and breaking the conventions of traditional team based shooters.\n\nIt is September 1998 and the action centers once more on the ill-fated Raccoon City and the horrific consequences of the deadly T-virus outbreak from the Umbrella facility. With a cover up required, Umbrella orders an elite team into Raccoon City to destroy all evidence of the outbreak and eliminate any survivors. Hearing of this plan, the US Government dispatches its own special forces to uncover any evidence that exposes the cause of the viral infection and Umbrella's actions. Players take on the role of an Umbrella Security Services soldier (U.S.S.), competing alone or in four player co-op in a battle against all the competing forces at play in Raccoon City.\n\n--------------------------------FEATURES-----------------------------------\n\nTeam - based shooter set in the dark and sinister Resident Evil universe.\nTriple - threat battle as zombies and B.O.WÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s add to the action.\nCompete - alone in Campaign mode as an Umbrella Security Service member or in a four player co-op team battle.\nRewrite - the history of the Raccoon City outbreak.
