The fictional band's music was recorded by session musicians featuring Ron Dante on vocals and released as a series of singles and albums. Their most successful song, &quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot;, became one of the biggest hits of the bubblegum pop genre that flourished from 1968 to 1972. \nRead More On: &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Archies&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Archies&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&quot;EVERYTHING'S ARCHIE&quot;\nThe Archies' first album, on which &quot;Sugar Sugar&quot; does light up the top of side two, so new then that Debbie Sherwood fails to mention it in her liner notes. Even apart from that classic, the Archies' crew -- spearheaded by producer Jeff Barry, singer Ron Dante, and puppetmaster Don Kirshner -- rushed out of the gate with 12 ingots of pure pop, tight construction enlivened with supple and spontaneous-sounding harmonies, knowing production tricks (&quot;Melody Hill&quot;'s outer-space jingle bells and &quot;cuckoo, cuckoo&quot; counterpoint), plus a little-appreciated underpinning of soul music. &quot;Inside out-Upside Down&quot;'s call and response flirts with childishness in its glee, but Dante's hearty &quot;pour a little sugar on it baby!&quot; and &quot;put some mustard on my roll&quot; from &quot;Hot Dog&quot; expose the earthy side of this so-called kiddie act. The girl's name in &quot;Feelin' So Good&quot; turns out to be &quot;S.K.O.O.B.Y.-D.O.O.&quot;; you suppose Mr. Hanna or Mr. Barbera's ears pricked up? ~ Andrew Hamlin, All Music Guide\n\n&quot;SUGAR, SUGAR&quot;\n&quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot; is a pop song written by Jeff Barry and Andy Kim. It was a four-week 1969 number-one hit single by fictional characters The Archies. Produced by Jeff Barry, the song was originally released on the album Everything's Archie. The album is the product of a group of studio musicians managed by Don Kirshner. Ron Dante's lead vocals were accompanied by those of Toni Wine (who sang the line &quot;I'm gonna make your life so sweet&quot;), Andy Kim, and Ellie Greenwich. Together, they provided the voices of the various Archies using multitracking. Ray Stevens, the comic singer, provided the hand claps to the song. \nThe ArchieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot; was the 1969 number one single of the year. According to Billboard magazine, this is a feat yet to be duplicated by any other fictional band. It spent four weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 from September 20, 1969 and eight weeks at the top of the UK singles chart. The song lists at #63 on Billboard's Greatest Songs of All Time.On February 5, 2006, &quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot; was inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame, as co-writer Andy Kim is originally from Montreal, Quebec.\n&quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot; is considered the canonical example of the bubblegum pop musical genre. Rumors have circulated that the song was earlier offered to and recorded by The Monkees with Davy Jones providing all the vocals, but never released. Don Kirshner himself says in an interview on &quot;Popular Song: Soundtrack of the Century episode Modern Pop&quot;, that Mike Nesmith put his fist through the wall of the Beverley Hills hotel refusing to do &quot;Sugar,Sugar&quot;.However, when asked Jones confirmed that Kirshner had offered it to them, but stated he never recorded it.\nRead More On: &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar,_Sugar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar,_Sugar&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTracklist:\n01.
