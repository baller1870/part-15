The group was the latest venture of David Bowie, inspired by sessions with guitarist Reeves Gabrels. Drummer Hunt Sales and bassist Tony Sales formed the rest of the band, with &quot;fifth member&quot; Kevin Armstrong providing rhythm guitar.\nThe project was intended as a back-to-basics album by Bowie, with a hard rock sound and simple production, as opposed to his past two solo albums. Unlike previous Bowie bands (such as The Spiders from Mars), Tin Machine acted as a democratic unit.\n\n\nCountry: UK\nGenre: Rock\nQuality: FLAC/tracks+.cue\n\nTracklist:\n1. HEAVEN'S IN HERE\n2.
