Some songs is quite common, others quite rare. I know some bands might be more &quot;pure&quot; melodic-black/death metal and others not, but we can argue about that somewhere else, wether they should be labeled as something else etc..\n\nSome of the mp3 are ripped by me, and others not. But all of them are top notch quality.\n\nVarious - Best Of Swedish Melodic-Black/Death Metal [Vol I]\nMP3/2007/73.8mb\n\n01 - MÃƒÂ¶rk Gryning - Tusen Ãƒâ€¦r Har GÃƒÂ¥tt.mp3 [192kbps] [03:33] [4.9mb]\n02 - Sacramentum - Far Away From The Sun.mp3 [128kbps] [05:13] [4.79mb]\n03 - Dawn - Falcula.mp3 [128kbps] [10:12] [9.34mb]\n04 - Dissection - The Somberlain.mp3 [320kbps] [07:06] [11.5mb]\n05 - Naglfar - Emerging From Her Weepings.mp3 [192kbps] [06:41] [9.19mb]\n06 - Cardinal Sin - Probe With A Quest.mp3 [128kbps] [05:35] [5.13mb]\n07 - Withered Beauty - Immortality Is Mine.mp3 [160kbps] [05:41] [6.51mb]\n08 - Zahrim - Birth Of Zahrim.mp3 [192kbps] [02:58] [4.09mb]\n09 - Embraced - Nightfall.mp3 [320kbps] [05:32] [10.7mb]\n10 - Vinterland - A Castle So Crystal Clear.mp3 [192kbps] [05:28] [7.52mb]\n\nAll the bitrates, lenght and size is a extension to the file name.\nAll tracks include some facts where they came from and they also include lyrics.\n\nIf anyone is interested I can seed the things these bands released, just PM.\nAnd if anyone is interested there is other bands in this genre to, which could make an volume 2.\n\nHopefully you will enjoy this release, and this is my first one, so if something doesn&amp;#039;t as its suppose to do please notifiy me.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8b3e2549551de4591247dec5391df98bc8e5b57","amp;dn":"VA+%5B2007%5D+Best+Of+Swedish+Melodic-Black%2FDeath+Metal+%5BVol+I%5D%2C+MP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8b3e2549551de4591247dec5391df98bc8e5b57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,179,226,84,149,81,222,69,145,36,125,236,83,145,223,152,188,142,91,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
