Then we watch as dotty artist Margaret Rutherford purchases a \n\ncopy of the Mona Lisa. Next we see British officer Jimmy Edwards go off on a \n\ntoot in a Parisian bistro. The next vignette involves impressionable Claire \n\nBloom, who is swept off her feet by a local rake (the human variety, not the \n\ngarden implement).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e309379bf57abb3504b1095582ef93a63341fad9","amp;dn":"Innocents+in+Paris+%281953+Alastair+Sim%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e309379bf57abb3504b1095582ef93a63341fad9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,9,55,155,245,122,187,53,4,177,9,85,130,239,147,166,51,65,250,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
