He was known for his travels and explorations within Asia, Africa and the Americas, as well as his extraordinary knowledge of languages and cultures. According to one count, he spoke 29 European, Asian and African languages.\n\nBurton's best-known achievements include traveling in disguise to Mecca, an unexpurgated translation of One Thousand and One Nights (commonly called The Arabian Nights in English after early translations of Antoine Galland's French version), bringing the Kama Sutra to publication in English, and journeying with John Hanning Speke as the first Europeans to visit the Great Lakes of Africa in search of the source of the Nile. Burton's works and letters extensively criticized colonial policies of the British Empire, to the detriment of his career. He was a prolific and erudite author and wrote numerous books and scholarly articles about subjects including human behaviour, travel, falconry, fencing, sexual practices and ethnography. A characteristic feature of his books is the copious footnotes and appendices containing remarkable observations and information.\n\nHe was a captain in the army of the East India Company, serving in India (and later, briefly, in the Crimean War). Following this, he was engaged by the Royal Geographical Society to explore the east coast of Africa and led an expedition guided by the locals and was the first European to see Lake Tanganyika. In later life, he served as British consul in Fernando Po, Santos, Damascus and, finally, Trieste. He was a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and was awarded a knighthood (KCMG) in 1886. \n\nThe Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night (1885), subtitled A Plain and Literal Translation of the Arabian Nights Entertainments, is a celebrated English language translation of One Thousand and One Nights (the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Arabian NightsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) -- a collection of Middle Eastern and South Asian stories and folk tales compiled in Arabic during the Islamic Golden Age (8th -13th centuries) -- by the British explorer and Arabist Richard Francis Burton (1821Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1890). It stood as the only complete translation of the Macnaghten or Calcutta II edition (Egyptian recension) of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Arabian NightsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ until the Malcolm C. and Ursula Lyons translation in 2008.\n\nBurtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s translation was one of two unabridged and unexpurgated English translations done in the 1880s; the first was by John Payne, under the title The Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night (1882Ã¢â‚¬â€œ84, nine volumes). BurtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ten volume version was published almost immediately afterward with a slightly different title. This, along with the fact that Burton closely advised Payne and partially based his books on PayneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, led later to charges of plagiarism. Owing to the sexual imagery in the source texts (which Burton made a special study of, adding extensive footnotes and appendices on Ã¢â‚¬Å“OrientalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sexual mores) and to the strict Victorian laws on obscene material, both translations were printed as private editions for subscribers only, rather than being published in the usual manner. Burton's original ten volumes were followed by a further six entitled The Supplemental Nights to the Thousand Nights and a Night (1886Ã¢â‚¬â€œ88). BurtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 16 volumes, while boasting many prominent admirers, have been criticized for their &quot;archaic language and extravagant idiom&quot; and &quot;obsessive focus on sexuality&quot;; they have even been called an &quot;eccentric ego-trip&quot; and a &quot;highly personal reworking of the text&quot;. His voluminous and obscurely detailed notes and appendices have been characterized as Ã¢â‚¬Å“obtrusive, kinky and highly personalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nIn 1982, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) began naming features on Saturn's moon Enceladus after characters and places in Burton's translation because Ã¢â‚¬Å“its surface is so strange and mysterious that it was given the Arabian Nights as a name bank, linking fantasy landscape with a literary fantasyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nREAD ME!!!\n==========\nIn order to view these epub documents, you need to install either \n(1) Epub Reader Free Full Setup (if you don't have internet)\n(2) Cool Reader Free Full Setup (if you don't have internet)\nor \n(3) Adobe digital editions (1-time permanent activation over internet).\n\n\nENJOY READING! \n\n\n\n[HYPERDRIVE25]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:659ab20c4c210838e3262bc291ae874c7d3c2aac","amp;dn":"The+Book+Of+A+1001+Nights+R.F+BURTON+%5BHyperdrive25%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"659ab20c4c210838e3262bc291ae874c7d3c2aac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,154,178,12,76,33,8,56,227,38,43,194,145,174,135,76,125,60,42,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
