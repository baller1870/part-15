After a terrifying mid-air disaster and subsequent crash, these three are the sole survivors, stranded together on a deserted tropical island. Or so they think. Semi, Miranda, and Arnie stumble into the hands of Dr. Franklin, a mad scientist whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been waiting for them, eager to use them as specimens for his experiments in genetic engineering.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b13d1d4979c9fdcbf1ed4a1b5c4a592b72b94879","amp;dn":"Dr+Franklin%27s+Island+by+Ann+Halam+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b13d1d4979c9fdcbf1ed4a1b5c4a592b72b94879","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,61,29,73,121,201,253,203,241,237,74,27,92,74,89,43,114,185,72,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
