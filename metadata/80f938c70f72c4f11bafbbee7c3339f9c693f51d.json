What started out as a simple illustrated card soon grew into a full-fledged comic book: a collection of short strips chronicling the often absurd process of getting married. A loose, cartoony departure from Tomine's previous work, Scenes from an Impending Marriage is a sweet-natured, laugh out-loud skewering of the modern marriage process, including hiring a DJ, location scouting, trips to the salon, suit fittings, dance lessons, registering for gifts, and managing familial demands. The most personal and autobiographical work of Tomine's career, Scenes from an Impending Marriage is a charming, delightful token of love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80f938c70f72c4f11bafbbee7c3339f9c693f51d","amp;dn":"Adrian+Tomine+-+Scenes+From+an+Impending+Marriage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80f938c70f72c4f11bafbbee7c3339f9c693f51d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,249,56,199,15,114,196,241,27,175,187,238,124,51,57,249,198,147,245,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
