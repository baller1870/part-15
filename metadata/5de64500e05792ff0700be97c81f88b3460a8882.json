That was nearly twenty years ago, and today, she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t imagine life without them.\n\nJourney with this rebellious angel medium as she goes kicking and screaming to her destiny and discovers the surprising relationship between humans and the benevolent hosts of heaven. From pre-life planning and birth through the traumas, losses, and joys of life to the moment a soul returns to heaven, archangels walk with us every step of the way.\n\nOur older siblings in spirit, these heavenly guardians are entrusted to teach and guide us. And while theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not here to do our work for us, we can find peace in day-to-day living and fulfill our purpose for this lifetime when we learn to embrace the archangels.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5de64500e05792ff0700be97c81f88b3460a8882","amp;dn":"Angelic+Pathways+-+Chantel+Lysette+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5de64500e05792ff0700be97c81f88b3460a8882","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,230,69,0,224,87,146,255,7,0,190,151,200,31,136,179,70,10,136,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
