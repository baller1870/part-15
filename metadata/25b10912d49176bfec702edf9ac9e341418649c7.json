In The Silk Tapestry, an impoverished elderly woman's only hope against a life of hardship lies in the completion of a magical tapestry. It is said to be the key to a paradise. Already living in squalor, how much more of herself is she willing sacrifice to see her dream come to fruition? In Sausage-Boy and his Magic Brush, a young boy's remarkable talent for paintings that come to life attracts a greedy woman. In The Creation Myth of Pan Gu a lonely but wild spirit sculpts the Earth from a cosmic egg in hopes it brings others like him to keep him company.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25b10912d49176bfec702edf9ac9e341418649c7","amp;dn":"Silk+Tapestry+and+Other+Chinese+Folk+Tales","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25b10912d49176bfec702edf9ac9e341418649c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,177,9,18,212,145,118,191,236,112,46,223,154,201,227,65,65,134,73,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
