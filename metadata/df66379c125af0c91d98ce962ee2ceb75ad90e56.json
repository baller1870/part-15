Embryo\n\n\nAfter dark side of the moon was recorded in 1973, the floyd was lured to another record company away from capital records for bigger money. They've been with capital for all their early works. Capital records, still owning the rights on all music dark side and earlier, decided to cash in on Floyd's new found fame by releasing a compilation. Works was done without Pink Floyd's input, nor did any band members receive any dividends from sale. It is strictly a Capital Records investment. And to many diehard floydians, it's blasphemy because not only did Capital do it on their own, they remixed many of the tracks, such as Brain Damage. \nAnyway, the good side is that here you can find some great and hard to find tracks, as the two first Floyd singles Arnold Layne and See Emily Play.\n\n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 50\nArtist: Pink Floyd\nAlbum: Works\nYear: 1983\nGenre: Rock\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df66379c125af0c91d98ce962ee2ceb75ad90e56","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+Works+%5BFLAC-1983%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df66379c125af0c91d98ce962ee2ceb75ad90e56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,102,55,156,18,90,240,201,29,152,206,150,46,226,206,183,90,217,14,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
