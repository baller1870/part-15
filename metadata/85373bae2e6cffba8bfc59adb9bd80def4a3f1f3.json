Later Ivan Jay and the Jaymen) by Alvin Lee and Leo Lyons, Ivan Jay lead vocals (late 1960 to 1962) joined by Ric Lee in August 1965, replacing original drummer Dave Quickmire, who had joined the band in 1962). In 1966 The Jaybirds moved to London, where Chick Churchill joined the group. That November the quartet signed a manager, Chris Wright, and then they decided to change their name to Blues Trip, Blues Yard (under it they played a show at the legendary Marquee Club, supporting Bonzo Dog Band), and finally Ten Years After in November 1966. They became the first bands of the soon-to-be Chrysalis Agency. They secured a residency at the Marquee, and received an invitation to play at the renowned Windsor Jazz Festival in 1967. That performance led to a contract with Deram, a subsidiary company of Decca ? the first band so signed without a hit single. In October, 1967 self-titled debut album was released.\n\nIn 1968, after touring Scandinavia and the United States, Ten Years After released the second album, live Undead, which brought their first classic, &quot;I&amp;#039;m Going Home&quot;. This was followed in February, 1969 by studio issue, Stonedhenge, a British hit, that included another classic, &quot;Hear Me Calling&quot; (it was released also as a single, covered in 1972 by British glam rock rising stars, Slade). In July, 1969 they appeared at the Newport Jazz Festival, in the first event to which rock bands were invited. In August, Ten Years After performed a breakthrough American appearance at Woodstock; their furious-to-slow-to-furious rendition of &quot;I&amp;#039;m Going Home&quot; was featured in both the subsequent film and soundtrack album and catapulted them to star status.\n\n01.
