That said, the intensity and anger of Fafara seem to have increased to a higher level in this album. Beast is full of extreme, harsh lyrics. Fafara, who says he was going through a dark time when he wrote this record, also had to move in with friends for a few weeks due to wildfires and attributes these as other factors in the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s angrier works.&quot; and &quot;Overall, this album is a major step forward for DevilDriver and they should enjoy even more success than they did with 2009ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s Pray For Villains. And that record was pretty badass! Beast pounds your brain from beginning to end and there is no slowing this locomotive down. The added brutality should bring DevilDriver even more death metal fans as the Beast is truly unleashed upon the eager souls of millions of fans. And the restÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦well, I guess they are just grinfucked! Beast is a masterpiece of death metal brutality!&quot;\n\n\nALBUM: BEAST\n\nTRACK LIST!\n\n1.
