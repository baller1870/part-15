The video has some slight camera movement here and there as well as different crop positioins. So we cropped to the widest frame position. Deinterlaced, denoised, colors, sharpness, etc. Tried to deblock the best we could, but it's still blocky in some scenes. The audio was pretty nice, wasn't labeled as cam or TS but sounds like  direct more so than cam (could be wrong and sorry if we are). Ran it through an EQ to try and give it a little more bass and fix a few things. Once again we are late, but had other stuff going on.
