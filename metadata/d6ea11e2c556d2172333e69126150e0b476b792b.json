Thompson was a wise (perhaps too wise) teenager in Louisville - and takes us through 1967, when the publication of &quot;Hell's Angels&quot; made the author an international celebrity (and nearly resulted in his death). In the intervening years, Thompson's prolific and often profound correspondence gives us an unforgettable vista of the America of the Eisenhower and Kennedy years as well as an authoritative introduction to the cultural revolution of the sixties. With a vicious eye for detail, a rude wit, and a brutal take on any and all pretenders, Thompson's missiles pierce pomposity and rattle the soul. Whether written to his mother, Virginia, or to such luminaries as Charles Kuralt, Philip Graham, Norman Mailer, Tom Wolfe, Carey McWilliams, Lyndon Johnson, and Joan Baez, the letters represent the evolution of an American original, a singular voice defying an era of banality\n\n\n\nVolume 2 \nFrom the king of Ã¢â‚¬Å“GonzoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ journalism and bestselling author who brought you Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas comes another astonishing volume of letters by Hunter S. Thompson.\n\nBrazen, incisive, and outrageous as ever, this second volume of ThompsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s private correspondence is the highly anticipated follow-up to The Proud Highway. When that first book of letters appeared in 1997, Time pronounced it &quot;deliriously entertaining&quot;; Rolling Stone called it &quot;brilliant beyond description&quot;; and The New York Times celebrated its &quot;wicked humor and bracing political conviction.&quot;\n\nSpanning the years between 1968 and 1976, these never-before-published letters show Thompson building his legend: running for sheriff in Aspen, Colorado; creating the seminal road book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas; twisting political reporting to new heights for Rolling Stone; and making sense of it all in the landmark Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72. To read Thompson's dispatches from these yearsÃ¢â‚¬â€addressed to the author's friends, enemies, editors, and creditors, and such notables as Jimmy Carter, Tom Wolfe, and Kurt VonnegutÃ¢â‚¬â€is to read a raw, revolutionary eyewitness account of one of the most exciting and pivotal eras in American history.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6ea11e2c556d2172333e69126150e0b476b792b","amp;dn":"Hunter+S+Thompson-+The+Gonzo+Letters+a.k.a.+The+Fear+and+Loathin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6ea11e2c556d2172333e69126150e0b476b792b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,234,17,226,197,86,210,23,35,51,230,145,38,21,14,11,71,107,121,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
