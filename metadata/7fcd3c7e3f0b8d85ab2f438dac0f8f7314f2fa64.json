However, astronomical CCD cameras are still very expensive, and technology has now progressed so that digital cameras ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the kind you use on holiday ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ are more than capable of photographing the brighter astronomical objects, notably the Moon and major planets.\n\nTony Buick has worked for two years on the techniques involved, and has written this illustrated step-by-step manual for anyone who has a telescope (of any size) and a digital camera. The color images he has produced ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ there are over 300 of them in the book ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ are of breathtaking quality.\n\nHis book is more than a manual of techniques (including details of how to make a low-cost DIY camera mount) and examples; it also provides a concise photographic atlas of the whole of the nearside of the Moon ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ with every image made using a standard digital camera ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and describes the various lunar features, including the sites of manned and robotic landings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fcd3c7e3f0b8d85ab2f438dac0f8f7314f2fa64","amp;dn":"How+to+Photograph+the+Moon+and+Planets+with+Your+Digital+Camera+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fcd3c7e3f0b8d85ab2f438dac0f8f7314f2fa64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,205,60,126,63,11,141,133,171,47,67,141,172,15,143,115,20,242,250,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
