However, the band are now taking a more structured\napproach to song writing, with the addition of Charlotte James contributing to the\nwriting process.\n\nThe duo are considered pioneers of the electronic genre, and have produced four studio\nalbums, all garnering critical acclaim. They are known for their cinematic approach to\ntheir production, specifically with the use of orchestral sounds, which is particularly\nnotable on their debut album Wide Angle when they collaborated with the Russian Federal\nOrchestra. Also over their seventeen-year career, they have produced over 100 remixes\nfor over 40 artists.\n\n________________________________\n\n\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications\n\nAudio File Formats: FLAC Lossless and MP3\nCodec Version [FLAC]: libFLAC 1.2.1\nCodec Version [MP3]: LAME 3.99r\nEncoding Compression Level [FLAC]: Level 8\nEncoding Bit Rate [MP3]: 320 kbps (Constant Bit Rate)\nNumber of Audio Channels [FLAC Lossless and MP3]: 2 (Stereo)\nAudio Quality [FLAC Lossless and MP3]: 16 bit / 44100 kHz\nAudio File ID Tags: VorbisComment\nIncluded Artwork: Scans (Plus Embedded Artwork Within FLAC / MP3 Files)\nTag / Artwork Editor: Mp3tag v2.58\nAdditional Files: LOG, CUE Sheets, MD5, FFP, SFV and M3U\nNumber Of Tracks [FLAC]: 237\nNumber Of Tracks [MP3]: 315\nRunning Time [FLAC]: 19 Hours 54 Minutes and 28 Seconds\nRunning Time [MP3]: 1 Day 25 minutes and 13 Seconds\nTotal File Size: 11.0 GB GB\nEncoder and Ripper: BSW\n\n________________________________\n\n\nAlbum List [FLAC + MP3 Formats]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/79682089381094024894.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/79682089381094024894.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n01.
