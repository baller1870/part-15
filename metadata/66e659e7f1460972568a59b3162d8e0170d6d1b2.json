A good rule of thumb is to upload at least as much as you've downloaded (1 to 1 ratio)...thanks!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCRF encoding maintains a constant quality across episodes by adjusting the required file size (bit-rate) to maintain the desired quality. Some scenes/episodes need a higher bit-rate than others. CRF...file sizes never too little and never too much...constant high quality across the board.\nThe high profile x264 settings provide greater compression, while maintaining the crf-18.5. i.e. CRF-18.5 at lower x264 settings would have the same quality, but would result in larger files.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n~NO: 350mb/700mb no matter what quality files, x-vid video, mp3 audio.\n~Always: Untouched ac3 or dts audio, full resolution video, high-profile x264 settings, Larger files (only) when needed.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66e659e7f1460972568a59b3162d8e0170d6d1b2","amp;dn":"The.X-Files.Fight.The.Future.1998.x264.DTS.5.1-MCH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66e659e7f1460972568a59b3162d8e0170d6d1b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,230,89,231,241,70,9,114,86,138,89,179,22,45,142,1,112,214,209,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
