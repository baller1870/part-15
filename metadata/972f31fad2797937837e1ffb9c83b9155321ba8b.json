His adversary is a man known only to the reader as the Saracen. As a young boy, the Saracen barely sees his dissident father beheaded in a Saudi Arabian public square. But the event marks him for life and creates a burning desire to destroy the special relationship between the US and the Kingdom. Everything in the SaracenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life from this moment forward will be in service to jihad.\n\nAt the novelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s opening, we find ourselves in a seedy hotel near Ground Zero. A woman lies face down in a pool of acid, features melted off her face, teeth missing, fingerprints gone. The room has been sprayed down with DNA-eradicating antiseptic spray. All the techniques are pulled directly from Pilgrim's book, a cult classic of forensic science written under a pen name.\n\nIn offering the NYPD some casual assistance with the case, Pilgrim gets pulled back into the intelligence underground. What follows is a thriller that jockeys between astonishingly detailed character study and breakneck globetrotting. The author shifts effortlessly from PilgrimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hidden life of leisure in Paris to the SaracenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s squalid warrior life in Afghanistan, from the hallways of an exclusive Swiss bank to the laboratories of a nefarious biotech facility in Syria.\n\nThe inevitable encounter between Pilgrim and the Saracen will come in Turkey, around the murder of a wealthy American, in a thrilling, twisting, beautifully orchestrated finale.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:972f31fad2797937837e1ffb9c83b9155321ba8b","amp;dn":"Terry+Hayes+-+I+Am+Pilgrim+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"972f31fad2797937837e1ffb9c83b9155321ba8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,47,49,250,210,121,121,55,131,126,31,251,156,131,185,21,83,33,186,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
