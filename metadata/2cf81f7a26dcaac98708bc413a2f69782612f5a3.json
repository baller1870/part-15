The reactor for the missile was to be developed by the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, with the ramjet being built by Marquadt. Ling-Temco-Vought was awarded the contract to develop the airframe for the missile itself, which was known as SLAM (Supersonic Low-Altitude Missile).\n\nThe mission profile called for SLAM to be launched from hardened silos, propelled by solid rocket boosters up to ramjet ignition speed. SLAM would then cruise at high altitude (35,000ft/10,700m) at Mach 4, where it&amp;#039;s range was estimated to be more than 10,000km. This meant the missile could &amp;#039;loiter&amp;#039; at a fail safe point until it was ordered to either continue to it&amp;#039;s target or abort its mission. Over enemy territory it would descend to low level, using TERCOM (Terrain Contour Matching) to find its way to multiple targets. \n\n\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: hof-pp.mpg\nFilesize.....: 462 MB (or 473,284 KB or 484,642,816 bytes)\nRuntime......: 39:18.625\nVideo Codec..: MPEG2\nVideo Bitrate: 2114\nAudio Codec..: MPEG-1 Layer 2\nAudio Bitrate: 192 CBR\nFrame Size...: 480 x 480\nLanguage.....: English\n\n\nVisit Conspiracy Central for reseed requests, more info and other downloads.\nTracker: http://conspiracycentral.net:6969\nForums: http://conspiracycentral.info\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cf81f7a26dcaac98708bc413a2f69782612f5a3","amp;dn":"Discovery+Channel+-+History+of+Flight+-+Project+Pluto+%281997%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cf81f7a26dcaac98708bc413a2f69782612f5a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,248,31,122,38,220,170,201,135,8,188,65,58,47,105,120,38,18,245,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
