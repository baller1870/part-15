But today it is widely dismissed, especially by progressives.  Liberalism is the often unexamined basis of much ethical thinking in the Western world.  Yet, it often struggles to put forward clear ethical content.  Is it possible to marry the two systems?\n\nReview\n\n&quot;Wolfe's writing is often spirited, consistently incisive, and unfailingly clear. He does not stoop to caricature, is uninterested in partisan wrangling, and confines his argument to the most important issues and problems of the day. Like the interlocutors he criticizes, Wolfe is primarily interested in the future health of liberalism, and he treats those with whome he disagrees with the kind of carefulness and seriousness that bespeaks genuine respect. Although he often expresses appreciation for thir efforts and the concerns that underlie them, he does not dilute his criticisms and is frank in pointing to their failures. The result is a bracing engagement that is refreshingly direct without being combative.&quot; - Aristide Tessitore, Furman University Perspectives on Politics\n\n&quot;This book is a necessary beginning for conversation over 'natural law liberalism.'&quot; -Choice\n\nBook Description\n\nLiberal political philosophy and natural law theory are not contradictory, but -- properly understood -- mutually reinforcing. A careful analysis of the history of liberalism, identifying its core principles, and a similar examination of classical natural law theory (as represented by Thomas Aquinas and his intellectual descendents), show that a natural law liberalism is possible and desirable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8efdd55155d18d081ca8163d59b74251681b334c","amp;dn":"Natural+Law+Liberalism","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8efdd55155d18d081ca8163d59b74251681b334c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,253,213,81,85,209,141,8,28,168,22,61,89,183,66,81,104,27,51,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
