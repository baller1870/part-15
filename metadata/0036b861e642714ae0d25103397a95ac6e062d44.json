This makes the third time, with previous Treasures releases already exploring Mickey Mouse cartoon shorts of color and black &amp; white varieties. Mickey Mouse in Living Color, Volume Two picks up where the first color volume left off.\n\nThe earliest material here is from 1939, a time when Disney had already found success in feature films with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. With Pinocchio and other feature films already in progress and characters like Donald and Goofy growing in popularity, Disney was making fewer cartoon shorts starring the adventuresome mouse.\n\nNonetheless, Mickey Mouse remained one of the staples of the Walt Disney studio. This first disc of this set contains 18 animated shorts spanning through 1953, as well as segments from two feature film appearances.\n\nThe Mickey Mouse short is a distinct creature, heavy on comedic gags, and often short on plot. The cartoons in this collection display Mickey in a variety of comic adventures that define and redefine the personality of perhaps the most beloved animated character. Though not as groundbreaking or historic as previous Mickey Mouse releases, the shorts here are consistently entertaining and Mickey fans will undoubtedly be pleased. Many may find the inclusion of the three Mickey shorts from more recent years on Disc 2 to be a particular highlight.\n\nAll the shorts display a pleasingly sharp and clean video transfer, reflecting a significant amount of effort that paints this set and all the other Treasures sets. Even if some of this material appears on other DVDs, it is nice to have it all compiled together on these two discs. Most won't need my clear recommendation on this set, but those who have shied away from other cartoon short Treasures due to the age may be surprised to find the films on both discs more approachable. In the way of supplemental material, two terrific new featurettes shine, and are accompanied by some nice little treats.\n\nAnyone with an interest in Disney animation is bound to find something they like in this highly entertaining and wide-reaching collection of Mickey Mouse's later films.\n\n\n01.Society.Dog.Show.1939\n02.The.Pointer.1939\n03.Tugboat.Mickey.1940\n04.Plutos.Dream.House.1940\n05.Mr.Mouse.Takes.a.Trip.1940\n06.The.Little.Whirlwind.1941\n07.The.Nifty.Nineties.1941\n08.Orphans.Benefit.1941\n09.Mickeys.Birthday.Party.1942\n10.Symphony.Hour.1942\n11.Mickeys.Delayed.Date.1947\n12.Mickey.Down.Under.1948\n13.Mickey.and.the.Seal.1948\n14.Plutopia.1951\n15.RCoon.Dawg.1951\n16.Plutos.Party.1952\n17.Plutos.Christmas.Tree.1952\n18.The.Simple.Things.1953\n19.Mickeys.Christmas.Carol.1983\n20.The.Prince.and.the.Pauper.1990\n21.Runaway.Brain.1995\n22.Mickey and the Beanstalk.1947\n23.The Sorcerer's Apprentice.1940\n24.Deleted Animation from The Sorcerer's Apprentice.1940 \n\n\n\nFormat                                     : AVI\nAudio                                        : MPEG@128 Kbps.English 2 channels\nCodec                                        : XVID\nBit rate                                      : from 550 Kbps to 1 800 Kbps\nWidth                                        : 480 pixels\nHeight                                       : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                  : 4:3\nInfo                                         : http://www.ultimatedisney.com/mmlivingcolor2.html[/SIZE][/QUOTE]\n\n\n[URL=http://leetleech.org/][IMG]http://leetleech.org/images/75309562554706685596.jpeg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=http://leetleech.org/][IMG]http://leetleech.org/images/30546914973240294620.jpeg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=http://leetleech.org/][IMG]http://leetleech.org/images/82143848346066474166.jpeg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=http://leetleech.org/][IMG]http://leetleech.org/images/93690623819027494858.jpeg[/IMG][/URL][/CENTER]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0036b861e642714ae0d25103397a95ac6e062d44","amp;dn":"Mickey+Mouse+in+Living+Color+Volume+Two+DVDRip+-+Team+MJY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0036b861e642714ae0d25103397a95ac6e062d44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,54,184,97,230,66,113,74,224,210,81,3,57,122,149,172,110,6,45,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
