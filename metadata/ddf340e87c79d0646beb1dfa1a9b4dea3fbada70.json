You can preview your surround mixes on\nany sound card that has a DirectSound multichannel driver, and export the mix as a single 5.1 WMA\nfile, one interleaved 6-channel WAV file, or 6 individual mono wave files.\n\nWMA 9 support\nCool Edit Pro&amp;#039;s WMA 9 features includes support for the format&amp;#039;s new capabilities, including encoding\nto either constant bitrate or variable bitrate, support for sample rates up to 96kHz and bit depths to 24-\nbit, data rates up to 440 kbps, lossless compression, and multichannel files.\n\nGreatly improved Noise Reduction\nThe new Spectral Decay option makes possible much larger reductions in noise without adding\nunwanted artifacts.\n\nAdditional hardware controller support\nCool Edit Pro now supports the Mackie Control, Tascam US-224, and Event EZbus. Hardware\nmanufacturers can also write support for new controllers with the new Cool Edit Pro controller SDK.\n\nEnhanced SMPTE/MTC master and slave accuracy\n\nCool Edit Pro&amp;#039;s sync to external SMPTE/MTC sources is even more accurate than before. It will now\nchase a source with better than Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ frame accuracy.\n\nAbility to move tracks in multitrack by right clicking and dragging on track controls\nJust right click in the track controls and drag up and down to reposition entire tracks in the multitrack\nview.\n\nFaster response in VU meters and Frequency and Phase Analysis windows\nAll three of these analysis tools have much smoother updates in real time.\n\nSpin mode for Phase Analysis.\nThe Spin mode in Phase Analysis provides a new way to look at the phase relationships between\nchannels.\n\nIntelligent default sound card selection\nCool Edit Pro now selects its default sound card more intelligently, allowing you to get up and running even faster than before. \n\nMultichannel WAV import and export \nYou can now import WAV files with more than 2 channels as a series of mono WAVs. This enables\nyou to open a WAV file that contains a 5.1 surround mix, edit each of the wave files, and re-save the\ntracks as a multichannel wave file using the multichannel encoder.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddf340e87c79d0646beb1dfa1a9b4dea3fbada70","amp;dn":"Portable+CoolEdit+Pro+v2.1+-+THINSTALL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddf340e87c79d0646beb1dfa1a9b4dea3fbada70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,243,64,232,124,121,208,100,107,235,29,250,26,155,77,234,63,186,218,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
