Their mixed repertory of classical and popular fare clearly places them in the crossover genre, and their global popularity makes them a formidable alternative to the Three Tenors, the Three Irish Tenors, or other such male vocal groups. The quartet consists of three tenors -- American David Miller, Swiss Urs BÃƒÂ¼hler, and Frenchman SÃƒÂ©bastien Izambard -- and a baritone, Spanish opera singer Carlos MarÃƒÂ­n. Il Divo have appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show, Live with Regis and Kelly, American Idol, and other major television shows in Europe, and have performed in concert with Barbra Streisand and Toni Braxton and at major sporting and charity events. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.83% CDDA &amp; 98.15% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tSyco/Sony\nCatalog:\t\t88765421572\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.My Heart Will Go On (Il Mio Cuore Va)\n02.I Will Always Love You (Siempre Te Amare)\n03.Can't Help Falling In Love\n04.Alone (Solo)\n05.Unchained Melody (Senza Catene)\n06.Amazing Grace\n07.Heroe\n08.Unbreak My Heart (Regresa A Mi)\n09.Somewhere\n10.Passera\n11.All By Myself (Solo Otra Vez)\n12.Mama\n13.Adagio\n14.Without You\n15.Caruso\n16.You Raise Me Up (Por Ti Sere)\n17.My Way (A Mi Manera)\n18.Time To Say Goodbye (Con Te Partiro)\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Nights In White Satin (Notte Di Luce)\n02.Nella Fantasia\n03.Ave Maria\n04.La Vida Sin Amor\n05.Everytime I Look At You\n06.The Power Of Love (La Fuerza Mayor)\n07.You Raise Me Up (Por Ti Sere)\n08.Crying (Llorando)\n09.She\n10.Hallelujah (Aleluya)\n11.Pour Que Tu M'aimes Encore\n12.The Impossible Dream (Live)\n13.O Holy Night\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b91023fc804d63ebcce60ec32822c0ac05a35bc3","amp;dn":"Il+Divo+-+The+Greatest+Hits+%7B2CD+Deluxe%7D+2012+FLAC+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b91023fc804d63ebcce60ec32822c0ac05a35bc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,16,35,252,128,77,99,235,204,230,14,195,40,34,192,172,5,163,91,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
