Interference of waves and beats of sound are also demonstrated, followed by an explanation of shock waves and sonic booms. Segment length: 32 minutes\n\n    Vibrations and Sound II: The reflection, refraction, and speed of sound waves are explained. A discussion of forced vibrations and resonance culminates with exciting historical footage of the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in 1940. Segment length: 43 minutes\n\n    Radioactivity: The differences between alpha, beta, and gamma radiation are discussed, with emphasis on balancing nuclear equations. Radioactive half-life and techniques for radioactive dating are also explained. Segment length: 40 minutes\n\n    Fission and Fusion: Fission and fusion are distinguished and compared. Energy release from nuclear reactions is explained in terms of the resulting mass defects. Muon-induced cold fusion is briefly discussed. Segment length: 36 minutes\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42a638a09f1d60767a56f69bee386bf0c253204a","amp;dn":"Conceptual+Physics+Alive++-+Volume+8%3A+Vibration%2C+Sound%2C+Fission+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42a638a09f1d60767a56f69bee386bf0c253204a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,166,56,160,159,29,96,118,122,86,246,155,238,56,107,240,194,83,32,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
