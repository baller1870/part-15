But who, or what, is/are, Abraham . . . really? Abraham is a name. A symbol. A feeling. Abraham is a Non-Physical entity Ã¢â‚¬â€ whom Esther calls &quot;infinite intelligence&quot; and Jerry stated, &quot;the purest form of love I've ever encountered.&quot;\n\n\nThe Teachings of Abraham are based on a universal principle called the Law of Attraction and on the key role our emotions play, and they illuminate and inform every aspect of our experience.
