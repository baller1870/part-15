Freewheelin' contained just two covers, the traditional tune &quot;Corrina, Corrina&quot;, and &quot;Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which Dylan re-wrote extensively.[1] All the other songs were Dylan originals and the Freewheelin' album showcased for the first time Dylan's song-writing talent.[2] The album kicked off with &quot;Blowin' in the Wind&quot;, which would become one of Dylan's most celebrated songs. In July 1963, the song became an international hit for folk trio Peter, Paul &amp; Mary\n\nThe Freewheelin' Bob Dylan reached number 22 in the US (eventually going platinum), and later became a number 1 hit in the UK in 1965. It was one of 50 recordings chosen in 2002 by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry.\n\nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 97 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9016e87d77662a58ebf6b838fbbc4b7d21c5f6c","amp;dn":"Freewheeling+-+Bob+Dylan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9016e87d77662a58ebf6b838fbbc4b7d21c5f6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,1,110,135,215,118,98,165,142,191,107,131,143,187,196,183,210,28,95,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
