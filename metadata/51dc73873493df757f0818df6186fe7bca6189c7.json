These classics after all have helped define a generation. Jazz vocalists face this when they interpret the songs of Cole Porter and George Gershwin, along with many others that make up the great American Song Book. Cuban music has a significant canon as well. Songs which are not just memorable to Cubans, but well known favorites that resonate throughout Latin America.\n\n People are familiar with Cuban rhythms, but they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know the songs or the composers,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said Laugart, who came to New York City in 1998 from Havana. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what I wanted to do, introduce these songs to a new generation.\n\n Lagrimas y Rumba is a fine introduction to the singer-songwriterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s driven trova style from the city of Santiago and features works by two extremely influential composers of that era, Maria Teresa Vera and Miguel Matamoros. Laugart grew up listening and singing these tunes with her father, who encouraged her to sing starting at the age of five. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We heard these songs on the radio and everybody listened to the radio then,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she said of her Havana childhood.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Las Perlas\n 02 - Sabor Una Tumba\n 03 - Sitieria\n 04 - Viente Anos\n 05 - Nadie Se Salva\n 06 - Reclamo Mistico\n 07 - Juramento\n 08 - La Mujer De Antonio\n 09 - Y Tu Que Haz Hecho\n 10 - Ausencia\n 11 - Descarga Xiomara\n 12 - Reclamo Mistico Alt\n\n Produced by: David Chesky, Xiomara Laugart, and Axel Tosca Laugart.\n Executive Producer: Norman Chesky.\n Recorded, edited, and mastered by Nicholas Prout.\n Recorded January 31 st 2014 at The Hirsch Center for Performing Arts, Brooklyn, New York.\n Recorded Using: B &amp; K Binaural head, MSB A/D Converter, and Crystal microphone cable","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51dc73873493df757f0818df6186fe7bca6189c7","amp;dn":"Xiomara+Laugart+-+Tears+And+Rumba+%282015%29+24bit%2F192khz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51dc73873493df757f0818df6186fe7bca6189c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,220,115,135,52,147,223,117,127,8,24,223,97,134,254,123,202,97,137,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
