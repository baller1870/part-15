In an abrasive and brilliant three-hour cinematic essay, he wants us to know that the history, locations, and social makeup of Los Angeles bears little resemblance to how it has been depicted on screen over the years. According to Andersen, &quot;Los Angeles is where reality and representation get muddled,&quot; he says. The public conception of Los Angeles (he despises calling it LA) he says is of discontinuity, nonexistent addresses, phony telephone numbers, rich and corrupt individuals who live in modernist houses in the hills, and ethnic minorities who live next to oil refineries if they live at all.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgclik.com/viewer.php?file=21771137103657661352.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgclik.com/viewer.php?file=21771137103657661352.jpeg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea00da13aeb6cbed89ec3d6ff1e847f485cd3fe6","amp;dn":"Los+Angeles+Plays+Itself+%282003%29Thom+Andersen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea00da13aeb6cbed89ec3d6ff1e847f485cd3fe6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,0,218,19,174,182,203,237,137,236,61,111,241,232,71,244,133,205,63,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
