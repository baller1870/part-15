Series\n\nHKFlix Says:  \t3 Stars\nNot a bad film, and it&amp;#039;s fun to see Gordon Liu looking so young (and Eric Tsang, if you can spot him!). But there wasn&amp;#039;t enough action, and the whole Pao competition just didn&amp;#039;t work for us.\n\nAvg. Rating: \t\n  3.9 / 5 (based on 12 ratings). What did you think of it?\n\nPlot:\tA young Wong Fei Hung must train, train, and train some more to avenge the evils being done by a rival kung fu school.\n\nOverview:\tAfter Lui Chia-Liang&amp;#039;s (AKA Lau Kar Leung) first film as director, &quot;The Spiritual Boxer&quot;, was a huge hit, Liang decided to make the greatest tale of Wong and his &quot;sifu&quot; (teacher) ever filmed. He made a star of his adoptive brother, Gordon Liu, in the leading role, and filled the cast with family members, friends, students, and the best Shaws had to offer. He even played the villain himself. The result was more Liang magic, with an honorable message of righteousness that rings true through the decades.\n\nCast: \tChen Kuan Tai  ||  Gordon Liu (Chia Hui)  ||  Wong Yu  ||  Lily Li Li-Li  ||  Kong Do  ||  Kong Yeung (Chiang Yang)  ||  Lau Kar Wing  ||  Liu Chia Liang  ||  Johnny Wang (Lung Wei)  ||  Ricky Hui (Goon Ying)  ||  Eric Tsang Chi-Wai  ||  Wilson Tong (Wai Shing)  ||  John Cheung (Ng Long)\n\nRunning Time:\t92 mins.
