It was made completely of clips found on the web. Music by Clark (warp.net/records/clark) \n\nWarning - This film contains scenes that some viewers may find disturbing.\n\n\nNo IMDB\n\nAlso vailable at:or http://studiocanoe.com/index.php?/films/documentaries/\n\n                \nSee Also: Blind Spot \n\nPlease repost\n\nshunster","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e3566a0e795f0faae375bd01798385cd3dbd084","amp;dn":"OBEY++2013+++Vimeo++studiocanoe+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e3566a0e795f0faae375bd01798385cd3dbd084","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,53,102,160,231,149,240,250,174,55,91,208,23,152,56,92,211,219,208,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
