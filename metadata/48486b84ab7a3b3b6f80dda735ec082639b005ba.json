Unlike existing JavaScript-for-mobile approaches, React Native actually renders natively, giving you the speed, look, and feel of a native mobile application.\n\nWith this practical book, web developers and frontend software engineers will learn how to use native UI elements, platform APIs (such as geolocation and local storage), and platform-specific design patterns to build high-quality mobile applications. This book focuses on iOS-based examples, but youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll leave armed with the principles necessary to use React Native effectively on all mobile platforms.\n\n    Write high-quality, native mobile applications with React Native\n    Build UIs using the platformÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s UI library, styling with Flexbox, and inline styles\n    Learn how to workflow and debugging work effectively in React Native\n    Deploy your React Native apps to the App Store\n\n\nPaperback: 200 pages\nPublisher: O'Reilly Media; 1 edition (December 25, 2015)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1491929006\nISBN-13: 978-1491929001","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48486b84ab7a3b3b6f80dda735ec082639b005ba","amp;dn":"Learning+React+Native%3A+Early+Release+Raw+%26amp%3B+Unedited+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48486b84ab7a3b3b6f80dda735ec082639b005ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,72,107,132,171,122,59,59,111,128,221,167,53,236,8,38,57,176,5,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
