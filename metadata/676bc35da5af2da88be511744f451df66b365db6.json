This album marked the beginning of the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s international success and was their first album released on the British Virgin records label. It achieved a six-figure sale in the UK, reaching No.15 in the charts in a 15-week run, with virtually no air play, only by strong word-of-mouth. It also earned the group a gold disc in Australia, and yet amazingly in their native Germany it sold barely 6,000 units. Alpha Centauri outsold it by nearly four-to-one.1\n\nThe title track was originally based on an improvisation that happened to be recorded in the studio, and unintentionally exhibits one of the limitations of the analog equipment used at the time. As the equipment warmed up, some of the oscillators began to detune (they were highly temperature-sensitive), which was responsible for some of the changes in the music towards the end of the piece.\n\nThe title track and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMovements of a VisionaryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ rely on Christopher FrankeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s use of the Moog analog sequencer as a substitute for bass guitar. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMysterious Semblance at the Strand of NightmaresÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ features Edgar Froese soloing on a Mellotron which is treated to slowly sweeping filter effects. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSequent CÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a short but memorable piece by Peter Baumann on flute, with tape echo.\n\nPhaedra is listed in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:676bc35da5af2da88be511744f451df66b365db6","amp;dn":"Tangerine+Dream+-+Phaedra+%281985%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"676bc35da5af2da88be511744f451df66b365db6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,107,195,93,165,175,45,168,139,229,17,116,79,69,29,246,107,54,93,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
