Just a year-and-a-half after Thousand Foot Krutch landed their second consecutive Hard Rock #1 and Billboard Top 10 album with the understated experiment Oxygen: Inhale, the adrenaline-doused rockers are back to the aggressive side of the dial with the entirely new companion collection Exhale. Not only is the experience loaded with arena-shaking anthems and bellowing battle cries at every self-assured turn, but the lyrics are some of the boldest and most uncompromising in the group history.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n1.
