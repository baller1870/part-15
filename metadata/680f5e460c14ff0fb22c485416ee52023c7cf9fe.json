They formed in 2007.\n\nMelbourne Australia based Twelve Foot Ninja are independent and self-funded. Their music and lyrics are inspired by a story (written by guitarist Stevic) of a ninjaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mission to restore balance in a world headed toward self-inflicted catastrophe. Sound familiar?\n\nTwelve Foot Ninja describe themselves as a hybrid of genres - metal, dub, yacht rock, funk and world music. The band has embraced the iPod Shuffle mentality and expressed themselves across genres - in the process they push hard on the boundaries of musical styles and credit their audience with the ability to embrace seemingly diverse influences.\n\nTracks include both albums\n\nSmoke Bomb (2010):\n1 Clarion \t\t\t\n2 War \t\t\t\n3 Apocolypstik \t\n4 Child With No Enemy \n5 Manufacture of Consent\n \nNew Dawn (2008):\n1 Beneath The Smiles \n2 Molotov Brother \n3 F.E.A.R \n4 Endless  \t\t\n5 Dark Passenger \n6 Portrait #1 \n\n\nSorry if the torrent isn\\'t perfect, I actually made an account to upload this, so hope it would be appreciated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:680f5e460c14ff0fb22c485416ee52023c7cf9fe","amp;dn":"Twelve+Foot+Ninja","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"680f5e460c14ff0fb22c485416ee52023c7cf9fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,15,94,70,12,20,255,15,178,44,72,84,22,238,82,2,60,124,249,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
