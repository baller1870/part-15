Heavily influenced both by Dizzy Gillespie and the rhythms of Cuba and South America.\n \n The 11-piece group - with original members Chucho ValdÃƒÂ©s on piano, Enrique PlÃƒÂ¡ on drums and Carlos Emilio Morales on guitar - is in top form on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Exuberancia Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Live at Ronnie ScottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Club 1988Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½, solid as ever.\n\n Although many obviously feel that the original version of Irakere, which included Arturo Sandoval and Paquito D'Rivera along with Chucho Valdes, is the best incarnation of the group, there is no denying the incredible power and virtuoso musicianship of this incarnation of the group from the late 80's-early 90's. \n\nThroughout this memorable set, the ensemble work is clean and loose, the percussionists keep the proceedings fiery and the soloists are excellent.\n There is no better setting to hear this incredible group than a live setting.\n \n Exuberant Latin jazz.\n\n\nIrakere\n\n Exuberancia:\n Live at Ronnie ScottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Club\n \n 1988\n\n \n\n CD / 1989 / 320Kbps\n\n\n\n Tracklist:\n\n 01 Xiomara \n\n 02 El Guayo de Catalina \n\n 03 Chango\n\n 04 El Reencuentro \n\n 05 Samba para Enrique \n\n 06 El Guao\n\n 07 Bown Music\n\n 08 Guantanamera \n\n 09 Bown Music (Encore)\n\n \n\n Recorded Live at Ã¢â‚¬ËœRonnie Scott's Jazz ClubÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, London, England in June 1988\n\n\n\nIrakere:\n\n Chucho ValdÃƒÂ©s (piano)\n\n Carlos Emilio Morales (guitar)\n\n Carlos Alvarez (vocals, trombone)\n\n Oscar ValdÃƒÂ©s (vocals, percussion)\n\n Javier Zaiba (flute, clarinet, soprano saxophone, baritone saxophone)\n\n Orlando &quot;Maraca&quot; Valle (flute, keyboards)\n\n Cesar Lopez (soprano saxophone, alto saxophone)\n\n Manuel Machado, Jorge Varona (trumpet)\n\n Miguel &quot;AngÃƒÂ¡&quot; Diaz (congas, percussion)\n\n Enrique PlÃƒÂ¡ (percussion)\n\n\n\nIrakere / Exuberancia: Live at Ronnie ScottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Club / 1988\n\n:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:006249097a4d3959d00625d57c0803ea4b95c915","amp;dn":"Irakere+-+Exuberancia%3A+Live+at+Ronnie+Scott%27s+Jazz+Club+%281988%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"006249097a4d3959d00625d57c0803ea4b95c915","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,98,73,9,122,77,57,89,208,6,37,213,124,8,3,234,75,149,201,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
