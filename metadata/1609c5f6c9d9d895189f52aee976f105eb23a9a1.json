This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nA piece of music that was played 4,000,000,000 throughout the United States in 1981 was not heard on the radio, could not be found in a jukebox, and could not be bought in a record store, but its first chart version is in this countdown.\n\nIn the history of the charts, only 2 groups have ever produced at least 3 members who have hit the top 10 as solo acts. One group was The Beatles. The other group has 2 of its solo-hitting members in this countdown. Casey explains.\n\nA listener wants to know what recording act in the rock era holds the record for debuting at the highest position with their first chart record. Casey says this song debuted at number 23 and eventually went to number one.\n\nIn the 1955, &quot;The Crazy Otto Medley&quot; by Johnny Maddox spent 6 consecutive weeks at number 2. By 1978, when Gerry Rafferty's &quot;Baker Street&quot; did the same, there was a four-way tie for most consecutive weeks at number 2. The song that broke that record is in this countdown.\n\nLW#2: Waiting For A Girl Like You - Foreigner\nLW#1: Physical - Olivia Newton-John\n40: Don't Stop Believin' - Journey\n39: Spirits In The Material World - The Police\n38: Pac-Man Fever - Buckner &amp; Garcia\n37: That Girl - Stevie Wonder\n36: ABACAB - Genesis\n35: Sea Of Love - Del Shannon\n34: It's All Our Tomorrows - Eddie Schwartz\n33: Working For The Weekend - Loverboy\n32: Somewhere Down The Road - Barry Manilow\n31: Key Largo - Bertie Higgins\n30: Love In The First Degree - Alabama\n29: Mirrormirror - Diana Ross\nLDD: You Decorated My Life - Kenny Rogers\n28: Yesterday's Songs - Neil Diamond\n27: I Wouldn't Have Missed It For The World - Ronnie Milsap\n26: Young Turks - Rod Stewart\n25: Through The Years - Kenny Rogers\n24: Love Is Allright Tonight - Rick Springfield\n23: She's Got A Way - Billy Joel\n22: Trouble - Lindsey Buckingham\n21: Open Arms - Journey\n20: You Could Have Been With Me - Sheena Easton\n19: Sweet Dreams - Air Supply\n18: Come Go With Me - Beach Boys\n17: Take It Easy On Me - Little River Band\n16: Leader Of The Band - Dan Fogelberg\n15: Someone Could Lose A Heart Tonight - Eddie Rabbitt\n14: Waiting On A Friend - Rolling Stones\n13: Shake It Up - The Cars\n12: Cool Night - Paul Davis\n11: Comin' In And Out Of Your Life - Barbra Streisand\n10: Hooked On Classics - The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra\n9: The Sweetest Thing - Juice Newton\n8: Let's Groove - Earth, Wind &amp; Fire\n7: Turn Your Love Around - George Benson\n6: Leather &amp; Lace - Stevie Nicks And Don Henley\nLDD: Here I Am - Air Supply\n5: Harden My Heart - Quarterflash\n4: Physical - Olivia Newton-John\n3: Centerfold - The J.
