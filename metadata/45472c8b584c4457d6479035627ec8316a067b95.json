It introduced the features &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; and &quot;Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;, and was a showcase for the science fiction/suspense stories of artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, and for the groundbreaking work of writer-artist Jim Steranko. Two previous, unrelated pulp magazines also bore that title.\n\n[b]After Doctor Strange&amp;#039;s second series was canceled in the 1980s, Strange Tales was relaunched as Vol. 2, #1 (April 1987). A split book once again, it featured 10-page Doctor Strange and Cloak and Dagger stories (the latter continuing from Cloak and Dagger #11). This ended with issue #19 (Oct. 1988), after which new Doctor Strange and Cloak and Dagger series were launched.[/b]\n\nThanks to the scanners and the original sources\n\nPlease seed, Please enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45472c8b584c4457d6479035627ec8316a067b95","amp;dn":"Strange+Tales+v2+%281987.4+-+1988.10%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45472c8b584c4457d6479035627ec8316a067b95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,71,44,139,88,76,68,87,214,71,144,53,98,126,200,49,106,6,123,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
