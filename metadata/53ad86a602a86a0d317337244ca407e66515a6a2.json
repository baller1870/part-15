It gives business executives the knowledge necessary to make informed, educated decisions regarding cloud initiatives.\n\nThe authors first discuss the evolution of computing from a historical perspective, focusing primarily on advances that led to the development of cloud computing. They then survey some of the critical components that are necessary to make the cloud computing paradigm feasible. They also present various standards based on the use and implementation issues surrounding cloud computing and describe the infrastructure management that is maintained by cloud computing service providers. After addressing significant legal and philosophical issues, the book concludes with a hard look at successful cloud computing vendors.\n\nHelping to overcome the lack of understanding currently preventing even faster adoption of cloud computing, this book arms readers with guidance essential to make smart, strategic decisions on cloud initiatives. \n\nMy other torrents:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/insane86&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/insane86&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53ad86a602a86a0d317337244ca407e66515a6a2","amp;dn":"Cloud+Computing+Implementation+Management+and+Security","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53ad86a602a86a0d317337244ca407e66515a6a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,173,134,166,2,168,106,13,49,115,55,36,76,164,7,230,101,21,166,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
