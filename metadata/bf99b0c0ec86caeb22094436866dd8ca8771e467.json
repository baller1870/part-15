I haven't seen the book by that title but I do have a book by Tablo called Pieces of You which was originally published in English then translated into Korean (and seriously enhanced with photos, etc)...  I'll see what I can do about sharing that in the future, too!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf99b0c0ec86caeb22094436866dd8ca8771e467","amp;dn":"Epik+High+Collection+-+More+%28Korean+Hip-Hop%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf99b0c0ec86caeb22094436866dd8ca8771e467","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,153,176,192,236,134,202,235,34,9,68,54,134,109,216,202,135,113,228,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
