An exciting gathering\nof popular electro artists (Covenant, Seabound, Mesh...), along\nwith new signings (Iris, Beborn Beton, This Morn Omina) and fresh\nnewcomers.\n\nContributions consist of mostly exclusive mixes &amp; previously\nunreleased tracks as well as some completely exclusive material -\nin the past this already made the Dependence label compilation\nseries a collector's item in Europe. It also delivers an early\nglimpse in what the label is up to in 2015. Fresh and hot\nindustrial sounds with that touch of club compatibility known\nfrom this premiere Industrial and Electronic Pop label.\n\n[GROUPNOTES]\n\nFWYH : FUCK WHAT YOU HEARD, We're all about Family\nDedication, Quality, Respect &amp; LOVE for the music!\nAs the years pass, all our motives and objectives\nremain,we want to give the best of dark electronic\ngenres,with the quality deserved for the only true\nunderground scene, the Future is these genres!!!!!\n\nTo all the artists that we release, some newcomers\n&amp; other established acts: We are sorry if you dont\nunderstand the promotion we do, of your own work,\nbut if you make quality music, we are pretty sure\nthat a lot of people will spend their own money on\nyour art.
