With Motown's proclivity to recycle and repackage the same material, \nit comes as no surprise that Gold gathers together four previously issued \ngreatest-hits compilations, Greatest Hits, Vol. 1, Vol. 2, and Vol. 3 as well as \nAt Their Best. To their credit, Motown/Universal took great care in selecting \nthe tracks featured on this 40-song opus, including fan favorites and the hits \nthat took the group straight from the streets of Detroit to the top of the \ncharts, without the inclusion of filler and obvious throwaway tracks. Die-hard \nfans of the girl group will most likely own all of these hits as well as the \noutstanding post-Diana Ross'70s Anthology issued in 2002. However, those looking \nfor a solid compilation from one of the cornerstones of the mighty Motown music \nmachine will find this to be an excellent reference point and most likely the \nonly collection they'll really need on their shelves. \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                      IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ (A REQUEST)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt's usual to post comments only to complain about a torrent which doesn't work \nin your configuration.  It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and \nexpecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and \nexpressing this is legitimate.\n\nI've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ \npeople, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading \nand therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, \nbut to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused \ntools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for\nfree.\n\nIF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING \nA LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent \nalive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is\nreached.\n\nThanks\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOther recent uploads...\n\nKiss - Gold (2CD) [EAC-FLAC] [RePoPo]\nBird Up - The Charlie Parker Remix Project [EAC-FLAC] [RePoPo]\nQuincy Jones - From Q With Love [EAC-FLAC] [RePoPo]\nQueen - Queen II [Hollywood Records] [EAC-FLAC] [RePoPo]\nQueen - Queen [Hollywood Records] [EAC-FLAC]\nMike Oldfield - Tubular Bells (The Ultimate Edition 2009 DVD - 2009 5.1 Mix) [ISO] [RePoPo]\nMike Oldfield - Tubular Bells (The Ultimate Edition 2009 3CD) [EAC-FLAC] [RePoPo]\nYuri Nomi - The Cat Returns (Ghibli's Neko No Ongaeshi) [EAC-FLAC] [RePoPo]\nBob Dylan - Dylan (3-CD) [EAC-FLAC] [RePoPo]\nTalk Talk - Asides Besides [EAC-FLAC] [RePoPo]\nThe Everly Brothers - Stories We Could Tell [EAC-FLAC] [RePoPo]\nAlejandro Jodorowsky - Soundtracks [EAC-FLAC] [RePoPo]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:074768b39589c3e2ad4fb3b4dc443d4b9c9d5774","amp;dn":"The+Supremes+-+Gold+%282+CD%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D+%5BRePoPo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"074768b39589c3e2ad4fb3b4dc443d4b9c9d5774","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,71,104,179,149,137,195,226,173,79,179,180,220,68,61,75,156,157,87,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
