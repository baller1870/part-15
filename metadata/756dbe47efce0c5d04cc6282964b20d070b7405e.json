Any that survive are non-representational. He was however one of the most highly regarded composers of his age, and was richly rewarded by his royal sponsors with various benefices. He was the most influential musician of his age, with his works copied in manuscript throughout much of Europe. Inevitably, some that were not his were attributed to him, creating a cottage industry among modern musicologists seeking to separate out the real from the wishful. His mass devoted to his &quot;patron saint,&quot; Anthony of Padua, was stipulated in his will to be performed every year for the supplication of his soul--and this continued through until the cathedral he ran, that of Cambrai, was demolished in 1796.\r\n\r\nBio enclosed, as well as essay in English, French, and German, and Latin texts with English translations.\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nA bio is enclosed, as well as an essay in English, French and German, and Latin texts with English translations.
