Originally called The Tornados, the name was changed to The Golden Earrings when they discovered that the name The Tornados was already in use by another group. The name The Golden Earrings was taken from a song called Golden Earring performed by the British group The Hunters, whom they served as opening and closing act for.The Golden Earrings had their first chart success with their debut single &quot;Please Go&quot;, recorded in 1965. It reached number 9 on the music charts in the Netherlands. Dissatisfied with Dutch recording studios, the band's manager and co-discoverer Fred Haayen arranged for the next single to be recorded at the Pye Records studios in London. The record cut at Pye, &quot;That Day&quot;, reached number two on the Dutch charts, prevented only from reaching the number one position by The Beatles' &quot;Michelle&quot;.\n                 In 1967, Barry Hay joined the band, replacing Krassenburg as frontman for the group. The following year, the band earned their first number one hit in the Netherlands with the song &quot;Dong Dong Diki Digi Dong.&quot;  They achieved worldwide fame with their international hit songs &quot;Radar Love&quot; in 1973, &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; aka When the Bullet Hits the Bone in 1982, and &quot;When the Lady Smiles&quot; in 1984. During their career they had nearly 30 top-ten singles on the Dutch charts; over the years they produced 25 studio albums. Current members of Golden Earring are Barry Hay (vocals, guitar, flute and saxophone, member since 1967), George Kooymans (vocals and guitar, founder of band), Rinus Gerritsen (bass and keyboard, founding member), and Cesar Zuiderwijk (drums and percussion, member since 1970).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da6299ee12bd5079cf74ddca7cd1bad2d88ae0f3","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+544","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da6299ee12bd5079cf74ddca7cd1bad2d88ae0f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,98,153,238,18,189,80,121,207,116,221,202,124,209,186,210,216,138,224,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
