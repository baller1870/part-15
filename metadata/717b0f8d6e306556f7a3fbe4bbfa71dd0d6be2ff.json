Although it was filmed at just three stops, all large outdoor venues, it beautifully captures the spirit of the shows and the hard work that goes into staging a Stones concert. The Stones themselves don't break new ground in personal revelations, but they do live up to expectations. Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman tend to fade into the background, Keith Richards is otherworldly, and Mick Jagger struts and poses. But Ashby wanted to show the vastness of the enterprise, not just the performers. His use of sweeping helicopter shots of the crowds is balanced by equal attention to the small details of the work of the roadies and technicians. The songs are familiar, recorded in stereo surround sound, and performed with the electric intensity expected of the Rolling Stones, arguably the world's greatest band. Ashby also opens things up by including a variety of newsreel footage collected over the 20 years the band has been together, some of which, including burning Buddhist monks in Vietnam, still startles, giving a historical feel to an otherwise fairly straightforward concert film. \n\nTRACKLIST: \n#1-Under My Thumb \n#2-Let's Spend The Night Together \n#3-Shattered \n#4-Neighbors \n#5-Black Limousine \n#6-Just My Imagination \n#7-20 Flight Rock \n#8-Let Me Go \n#9-Time Is On My Side \n#10-Beast Of Burden \n#11-Waiting On A Friend \n#12-Going To A Go-Go \n#13-You Can't Always Get What You Want \n#14-Little T &amp; A \n#15-Tumblin' Dice \n#16-She's So Cold \n#17-All Down The Line \n#18-Hang Fire \n#19-Miss You \n#20-Lean On Me \n#21-Start Me Up \n#22-Honky Tonk Woman \n#23-Brown Sugar \n#24-Jumpin' Jack Flash \n#25-Satisfaction \n\nINFO: \nFormat : MPEG-4\nFormat profile : Base Media\nCodec ID : isom\nFile size : 1.15 GiB\nDuration : 1h 26mn\nOverall bit rate mode : Variable\nOverall bit rate : 1 908 Kbps\nWriting application : Lavf52.104.0\n\nVideo\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP : No\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID : 20\nDuration : 1h 26mn\nBit rate : 1 776 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nOriginal display aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate mode : Constant\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\nStandard : NTSC\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression mode : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.171\nStream size : 1.07 GiB (93%)\nWriting library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID : 2\nFormat : AAC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile : LC\nCodec ID : 40\nDuration : 1h 26mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 79.2 MiB (7%)\n\nSIZE: 1.15GB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:717b0f8d6e306556f7a3fbe4bbfa71dd0d6be2ff","amp;dn":"Rolling+Stones-Let%27s+Spend+the+Night+Together%28dvdripmp4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"717b0f8d6e306556f7a3fbe4bbfa71dd0d6be2ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,123,15,141,110,48,101,86,247,163,251,228,187,250,113,221,13,107,226,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
