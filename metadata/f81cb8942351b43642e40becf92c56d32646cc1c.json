Emerson Lake and Palmer are captured here at the very beginning of a legendary career.\n\nFilmed at the time when the band had only just recorded their ground breaking first album, ELP had to use all of their huge individual creative talents to create a full show. Thats what makes this film so special. Extensive virtuoso playing by Keith Emerson, inventive percussion from Carl Palmer and a bravura performance at the mike by the young Greg Lake make this an essential addition to the collection of any fan of the progressive rock era.\n\nPlease enjoy, share and seed :)\n\nSetlist: \n\n1. the Barbarian\n2. Rondo/Bach imrpovisations\n3. Drum solo\n4. Nutrocker\n5. Take a Pebble\n^. Knife edge\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f81cb8942351b43642e40becf92c56d32646cc1c","amp;dn":"ELP+-+the+Live+Broadcasts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f81cb8942351b43642e40becf92c56d32646cc1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,28,184,148,35,81,180,54,66,228,11,236,249,44,86,211,38,70,204,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
