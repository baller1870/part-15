Dawkins proves to be a solid songwriter and an able singer, although the best moments on the album invariably come when he tears off a casually perfect, deeply soulful, but never showy electric solo. Highlights include the stomping instrumental &quot;Triple Trebles,&quot; featuring an outstanding Dawkins solo over a funky horn-driven rhythm, and the mellow, laid-back opener, &quot;It Serves Me Right to Suffer.&quot; The album was finally reissued on CD in 1998 with a new cover and two fine outtakes from the original sessions, &quot;Sad and Blues&quot; (which features an exceptional extended solo by Dawkins) and &quot;Back Home Blues,&quot; which is a 1969 recording with a new (1998 ) vocal by Dawkins. ~ Stewart Mason\n\nTracklist\n1.
