Please read before agreeing to download.\n\nThis movie is a restored fan edit. There is no dvd, hddvd or blue ray for this. There only exists a very bad quality avi set.\nI have restored this and improved on it massivly using h.264 and external filtters but it aint as good as a h.264 dvd rip. It will never look as good.\nYou will notice faint scaring and distortion from the start ( assuming your using a lcd ) and poor quality in some scenes.\n\nPlease be aware of this before downloading. Thank you.\n\n\nThe Pilot release group proudly presents after many moons of hard work...\n\nTitanic White Star Extended Edition\n\nSource: Fanedit avi extra extended alternate ending version by ADigitalMan\nYear: 1997/2006\nRunning time: 3:47:42\nGenre: Drama/Romance\nLanguage: English\nSubs: None\nFile size: 2gb\nTrackers: Ukb-kvcd / Tpb open tracker\n\nVideo track:\nSource: Demuxed fanedit avi\nVideo format: X264/H.264 AVC, Mpeg-4\nResolution: 720x320\nRatio: 2.35:1\nFrame rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding passes: 3 full pass encode\nAvg bitrate: 1130 kbps\n\nMain audio track:\nSource: Included English mp3 vbr stream\nFormat: Nero AAC LC\nChannels: 2 ( stereo )\nAvg bitrate: 160 kbps\n\nIMDB: Please note there is no official entry in the imdb for this edit. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/\nRating: 7.2/10\nTagline: A womans heart is a deap ocean of secrets\nStory: Fictional romantic tale of a rich girl and poor boy who meet on the ill fated voyage of the &quot;unsinkable&quot; ship the Titanic.\n\nEncoders notes: \nThis file is optimized for playback on standalone, ps3 and xbox 360. The size is kept at under 4 gig for storage on ps3 external fat 32 hdd.\n\nI sourced this for my mum, my mate, his mum, my wife etc...\n\nThis is an unoficial fanedit of the movie produced by ADigitalMan. It runs 31 mns longer than the largest official edit ( special extended edition )\n\nSource was REALY bad. ADigitalMan is an industry standard editor but he cant encode avi to save himself. Huge improvements where made to sharpness, detail and legibility however there are scars all over the place. This was NEVER going to be the quality of an H.264 dvd rip.\n\nSoz to all for the size. It was brought up to 2gig to keep the bitrate above 1000kbps. This is because of the running time. This movie runs as long as 2 movies. I had no chance of improving this at a smaller bitrate.\n\nADigitalMans Origional notes:\n\nThis three disc set restores all 29 deleted scenes to bring the run time to a whopping 3.75 hours. Using the Special Collector&amp;#039;s Edition of James Cameron&amp;#039;s TITANIC as a basis, this extended edition restores all of the deleted scenes in context with the film. \n\nEnjoy this movie. \n\n-==D-L33T3==-\n\nPilot Release Group\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10511e9b0b5bce4c05d186a15afeddc9d09c9138","amp;dn":"Titanic+White+Star+Extended+Edition%5B1997%2C2006%5DRestored+rare+fane","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10511e9b0b5bce4c05d186a15afeddc9d09c9138","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,81,30,155,11,91,206,76,5,209,134,161,90,254,221,201,208,156,145,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
