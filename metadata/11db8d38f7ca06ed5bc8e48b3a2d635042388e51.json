When Reed and Sue decide that the family needs to relax, they take Ben, Johnny and the kids on a little vacation... through all of infinite time and space!\n\n------\n\nThis is an outstanding Marvel NOW relaunch of the classic series that sparked the Marvel Age of Comics 52 years ago. Reed gets bitten by a dinosaur (is that you, Devil Dinosaur?) and realizes his flesh is starting to decay... He takes his family on an educational space-time vacation, all the while hoping to find a cure. Guest-starring Julius Caesar, Blastaar, and at least a dozen Dr. Dooms! Give it a try, if you haven't been following it.  --STF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11db8d38f7ca06ed5bc8e48b3a2d635042388e51","amp;dn":"FANTASTIC+FOUR+%28Marvel+NOW%29+001-009+%28Up-to-date+through+June+19%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11db8d38f7ca06ed5bc8e48b3a2d635042388e51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,219,141,56,247,202,6,237,91,200,228,139,58,45,99,80,66,56,142,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
