This release 2007 as part of the 24bit remastered 'Keepnews Collection'.\n\nReview by Scott Yanow:\nThis CD reissue matches together trumpeter Clark Terry (before he switched to flugelhorn) with tenor saxophonist Johnny Griffin, pianist Wynton Kelly, bassist Paul Chambers and drummer Philly Joe Jones. Most notable about the music is that Terry wrote five of the eight selections (including the colorful title cut which pays tribute to life on the road with Duke Ellington); the other numbers are &quot;Donna Lee,&quot; a pretty version of &quot;Stardust&quot; and a slightly Latinized &quot;That Old Black Magic.&quot; Terry and Griffin were a potent team, making one regret that they did not record together much through the years. This set contains excellent straightahead jazz performed with plenty of spirit. \n\n01. Donna Lee   \n02. Boardwalk    \n03. Boomerang  \n04. Digits   \n05. Serenade To A Bus Seat   \n06.
