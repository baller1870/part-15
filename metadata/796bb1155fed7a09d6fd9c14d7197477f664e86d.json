This compact, clamshell boxset features each album in a mini, vinyl replica card sleeve with original artwork, including replicated original gatefold sleeves for Tres Hombres and Tejas. \n\nMost importantly the original audio tape versions will finally be available, for the first time, on CD for three of the albums: First Album, Rio Grande Mud, and Tejas, and the original masters for Tres Hombres and Fandango will also be included. Much discussion has been had on the quality of the mixes released on CD in the 1980s but now the original audio will be available once and for all in an amazing boxset! \n\nArtwork Included.\n\nTracklist:\n\n\nCD 1 - 1971 - ZZ Top's First Album\n\n01.
