It was the debut \nsingle from Jackson\\&amp;#039;s 2001 album Invincible. The song peaked at #10 in the US (by air \nplay only), his first Top 10 single there in six years, since \\&quot;You Are Not Alone\\&quot;. \nContents \n \nSong information \n \nThe song was primarily written by Michael Jackson[citation needed] with co-writer credits \nalso going to Darkchild (who produced the song), Fred Jerkins III, LaShawn Daniels and Nora \nPayne. \nA comedic spoken-intro was recorded by Chris Tucker and Jackson, which involves Tucker and \nJackson talking about their attraction to a woman, and the two arguing about whether or not \nJackson can \\&quot;pick her up\\&quot;. \nMichael Jackson and Rodney Jerkins played all the instruments in the song, which was recorded \nat Record One studios in Los Angeles in 2001. \nThere is a remix to this song that features rapper Jay-Z. \nIn the UK, the song was held off number one by Kylie Minogue\\&amp;#039;s \\&quot;Can\\&amp;#039;t Get You out of My Head.\\&quot; \n \nMusic video \nThe music video for \\&quot;You Rock My World\\&quot; was premiered worldwide on September 21, 2001. \nThe USA premiere was delayed until September 26 due to the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York. \nLike many of Jackson\\&amp;#039;s music videos, this one takes the form of a short film based on a story written \nby Michael Jackson and Paul Hunter. It follows a story in which Michael Jackson and Chris Tucker \nspot an attractive woman (played by Kishaya Dudley) and follow her into a nightclub (called the \n\\&amp;#039;Waterfront Hotel\\&amp;#039; in reference to the famous film starring Marlon Brando, who plays the club\\&amp;#039;s \nowner in this music video). Obviously, they are not wanted there, because it seems the woman already \nhas a love interest (played by Michael Madsen). However, Jackson is determined to meet this woman. \n \nJackson serenades the woman with a song (\\&quot;You Rock My World\\&quot;), as well as performing his famous \ndance moves. He is then challenged to a fight by one of the regulars at the club (played by Billy \nDrago). When asked by Drago to \\&quot;show me what you got,\\&quot; Jackson (backed by line dancers) pulls off \na dance sequence choreographed by himself, Anthony \\&quot;Tone\\&quot; Talauega and Richmond Talauega. After the \ndance sequence Drago says to Jackson, \\&quot;Is that all you got? You ain\\&amp;#039;t nothin\\&amp;#039;\\&quot;, in response to this \nJackson punches Drago, which elevates to a fire in the building. When he evacuates the building and \nmeets up with the attractive woman of his lust, the two share an intimate moment before driving away \nin Tucker\\&amp;#039;s car. The music video also stars one of Jackson\\&amp;#039;s confidents, Frank Tyson (who only appears \nin one shot). The music video won a NAACP Image Award for Best Music Video in 2001. There is a short \nfilm version and music video version of the video, with the music video version being shorter. There \nis also a longer version of the video featuring more dialogue between Tucker and Jackson, along with \nvarious other changes available on the web. There is no word on whether or not this third version is \nofficial or a homemade edit from outtakes. \n         \nVideo Clip \n--- File Information --- \nZrodlo-Source: DVD \nNazwa pliku - File Name: Michael Jackson - Rock My World [SyNtEr].avi \nWielkosc pliku- File Size (in bytes): 136,462,336 \n--- Container Information --- \nTyp pliku - Base Type: AVI(.AVI), Subtype: OpenDML (AVI v2.0), \nTotal System Bitrate (kbps): 0 \nInterleave (in ms): 40, Preload (in ms): 504 \nNumber of Audio Streams: 1 \nAudio: 19.1 MB (14.72%) \nVideo: 110 MB (84.72%) \n--- Video Information --- \nVideo Codec Type(e.g. \\&quot;DIV3\\&quot;): H264, Video Codec Name: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC \nCzas - Duration (hh:mm:ss): 10:27.640 \nKlatki - Frame Count: 15691 \nObraz Szer x Wys - Size (pixels): 704 x 384 \nStorage Aspect Ratio(\\&quot;SAR\\&quot;)\\&quot;: 1.833 \nPixel Aspect Ratio (\\&quot;PAR\\&quot;): 1.000 \nDisplay Aspect Ratio (\\&quot;DAR\\&quot;): 1.833 \nFrames Per Second: 25.000 \nPics Per Second: 25.000 \nVideo Bitrate (kbps): 1473 \nKodowanie - Type(\\&quot;MPEG-4/B-VOP/QPel/GMC/NVOP/H264): ///// \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame: 0.218\\&quot; \n--- Audio Information --- \nAudio: Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3, Audio alignment: Aligned \nAudio: Sample Rate (Hz): 48000, Bitrate(kbps): 256, Bitrate Type: CBR, Channel Count: 2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e1c2c29883448d271db2c1429f83624493b9d63","amp;dn":"Michael+Jackson+-+You+Rock+My+World+%5BDVDRip-SyNtEr%5D+%5BH264%5D+%5BSubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e1c2c29883448d271db2c1429f83624493b9d63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,28,44,41,136,52,72,210,113,219,44,20,41,248,54,36,73,59,157,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
