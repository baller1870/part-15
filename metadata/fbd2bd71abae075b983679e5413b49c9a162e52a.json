If it doesn't work for you, make sure your system meets the minimum requirements (including Java Runtime Env't 1.3.1 or greater). Also, I've included the two SAS monospace fonts, which you may need to install manually. (And if it still doesn't work, just use R -- &quot;http://www.r-project.org&quot; or &quot;http://www.revolution-computing.com&quot;)\n\n*** If this download works for you, please consider coming back and leaving a comment to let others know--thanks ***\n\nTechnical details: I used ThinApp 4.0.4 (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5157673/) with the &quot;Licenced to...&quot; popup removed as per the instructions at &quot;http://edwinfriesen.nl/content/?p=106&amp;cpage=1#comment-723&quot;.\n\nThe following SAS modules are included in the licence file used to install:\nBase SAS Software\nSAS/ACCESS Interface to DB2 Software\nSAS/ACCESS Interface to ODBC Software\nSAS/ACCESS Interface to OLE DB Software\nSAS/ACCESS Interface to ORACLE Software\nSAS/ACCESS Interface to PC Files Software\nSAS/ACCESS Interface to SYBASE Software\nSAS/AF Software\nSAS/ASSIST Software\nSAS/CONNECT Software\nSAS/EIS Software\nSAS/ETS Software\nSAS/FSP Software\nSAS/GIS Software\nSAS/GRAPH Software\nSAS/IML Software\nSAS/INSIGHT Software\nSAS/LAB Software\nSAS/OR Software\nSAS/QC Software\nSAS/SECURE for Windows Software\nSAS/SHARE Software\nSAS/SPECTRAVIEW Software\nSAS/STAT Software\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbd2bd71abae075b983679e5413b49c9a162e52a","amp;dn":"SAS+v9+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbd2bd71abae075b983679e5413b49c9a162e52a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,210,189,113,171,174,7,91,152,54,121,229,65,59,73,201,161,98,229,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
