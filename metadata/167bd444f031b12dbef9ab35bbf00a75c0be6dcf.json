In a format understandable even by the non-expert, the author investigates the origins ofhuman intelligence , starting with classical Darwinian concepts. Thus, the strengths and beauty of natural selection are presented with many examples taken from natural history. Common criticisms of Darwin, from scientists and non-scientists alike, are confronted and shown to be either inconclusive or outright false.\nThe author then launches into a discussion of human intelligence, the most important feature of human evolution, and how it cannot be fully explained by mutational selection. Modern humans are smarter than what is demanded by our evolutionary experience as hunter-gatherers. The difficulty lies in the inability of natural selection to answer the following question: how can a complex set of genes, controlling expensive traits with little immediate benefit, come into permanent existence within a short time period in every member of a small population (which was dispersed and geographically isolated over a huge planet) which had a low reproductive output and a low mutation rate?\nThe book concludes with a speculative epigenetic theory of intelligence that does not require DNA mutations as a source of evolution. \n\nAlthough the book is comprehensible by anyone with a college education, this last section in particular should intrigue both layman and expert alike.\nContents\nEvolution:\n \nDarwin and Natural Selection\nDarwin Analyzed\nLamarck\nThe Thin Bone Vault: Definition of Intelligence; A Brief History of the Mind\nPopulation\nCulture\nAnimal Intelligence\nEvolutionary Potential: Elementary Genetics\nGene Variability, Examples\nDirected Mutations\nGenetics and Intelligence\nEvolution of Intelligence, an Epigenetic Model\nEpigenetics\nThe Cranial Feedback Mechanism.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:167bd444f031b12dbef9ab35bbf00a75c0be6dcf","amp;dn":"The+Thin+Bone+Vault+-+The+Origin+of+Human+Intelligence+2009+%28Mal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"167bd444f031b12dbef9ab35bbf00a75c0be6dcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,123,212,68,240,49,177,45,190,249,171,53,187,240,10,117,192,190,109,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
