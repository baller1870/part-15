In this eye-opening book he takes on the MMR hoax and misleading cosmetics ads, acupuncture and homeopathy, vitamins and mankindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vexed relationship with all manner of Ã¢â‚¬ËœtoxinsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Along the way, the self-confessed Ã¢â‚¬ËœJohnny Ball cum Witchfinder GeneralÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ performs a successful detox on a Barbie doll, sees his dead cat become a certified nutritionist and probes the supposed medical qualifications of Ã¢â‚¬ËœDrÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Gillian McKeith.\n\nFull spleen and satire, Ben Goldacre takes us on a hilarious, invigorating and ultimately alarming journey through the bad science we are fed daily by hacks and quacks.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d87d95c4ddde5987ae80fe29e9958fcd3630eb9","amp;dn":"Ben+Goldacre+-+Bad+Science+%28Unabridged%29+%5BMp3+-+Eng%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d87d95c4ddde5987ae80fe29e9958fcd3630eb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,135,217,92,77,221,229,152,122,232,15,226,158,153,88,252,211,99,14,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
