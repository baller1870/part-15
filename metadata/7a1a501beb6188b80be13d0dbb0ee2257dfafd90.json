He discovers our sense of time passing and the clocks that drive our bodies. He reveals the forces of time that make and destroy us in a lifetime. He journeys to some of the Earth's most spectacular geological sites to look for clues to the extraordinary depths of time at a planetary level. Finally, he takes us on a cosmic journey in search of the beginning (and the end) of time itself.\n\n\nPart 1: Daytime\n\nTime seems to drive every moment. It's the most inescapable force we feel. But do we experience time from within our minds and bodies or from the outside?\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a1a501beb6188b80be13d0dbb0ee2257dfafd90","amp;dn":"Time++%28BBC+2006+-+Part+1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a1a501beb6188b80be13d0dbb0ee2257dfafd90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,26,80,27,235,97,136,184,11,225,61,13,187,14,226,37,125,250,253,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
