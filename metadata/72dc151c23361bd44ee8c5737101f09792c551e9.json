Haven't tweaked the colours or anything else. The audio was ok but lacked bass so dropped it in goldwave and added some more bass to it,to give it some depth.Once done it was a case of syncing it,which was a bitch to do .....some major jumps in the audio gaps,ranging from 500 - 11700ms.So we did our best and we've scrolled through and didn't see any oos parts,but if there is.....hey sorry.\n\nAnyway retail should be out soon but until then,enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72dc151c23361bd44ee8c5737101f09792c551e9","amp;dn":"How+To+Train+Your+Dragon+2-D+HDTV+720p+RiP+READNFO+XViD+-+IMAGiN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72dc151c23361bd44ee8c5737101f09792c551e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,220,21,28,35,54,27,212,78,232,197,115,113,1,240,151,146,197,81,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
