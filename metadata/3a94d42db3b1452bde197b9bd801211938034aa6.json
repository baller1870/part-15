TPB wasn't allowing me to make an account for a few days. Song names are in the files list. I edited out all of the commercials, and MTV had an annoying habit of adding clicks when going into commercial breaks which cut off some of the fading out of the songs. Also, I included a promo for the show, which aired over Teen Mom 2, which was the show broadcasting prior to the Unplugged performance. Can't forget too that this is public television, so some songs are unfortunately censored (no tones, just silence).\n\nThis is literally exactly the same as my FLAC rip, just converted through DVDVideoSoft's Audio Converter program to be crystal clear, 320 kb/s MP3 files to be played on more modern portable media players.\n\nLet's hope that MTV releases an official CD/DVD/Blu-Ray package (including some songs that weren't aired?)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a94d42db3b1452bde197b9bd801211938034aa6","amp;dn":"Miley+Cyrus+-+MTV+Unplugged+%5BMP3+-+CBR+-+320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a94d42db3b1452bde197b9bd801211938034aa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,148,212,45,179,177,69,43,222,25,123,155,216,1,33,25,56,3,74,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
