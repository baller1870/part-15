The movements described range from well-known traditions such as German expressionism, Italian neorealism, French, British, and Czech new wave, and new Hollywood cinema to those of emerging significance, such as Danish Dogma, postcommunist cinema, Brazilian postÃ¢â‚¬â€œCinema Novo, new Argentine cinema, pre-independence African film traditions, Israeli persecution films, new Iranian cinema, Hindi film songs, Chinese wenyi pian melodrama, Japanese horror, and global found-footage cinema.\n\nThe essays, all written by recognized experts in the field, are jargon free and accessible to both general readers and students. In addition, each chapter is followed by a list of suggested films and readings, offering readers pathways to further viewing and study.\n\nBringing fresh insights to those movements that have provided significant and noteworthy alternatives to Hollywood, this book is an essential introduction to the rich diversity of world cinema.\n\nPublisher: Rutgers University Press (February 15, 2006)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0813538742\nISBN-13: 978-0813538747","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e061900f3b963cf7a8cf3ced66b4bcec5c39b2bc","amp;dn":"%5BLinda+Badley%2C+R.+Barton+Palmer%2C+Steven+Jay+Schneider%5DTraditions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e061900f3b963cf7a8cf3ced66b4bcec5c39b2bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,97,144,15,59,150,60,247,168,207,60,237,102,180,188,236,92,57,178,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
