He has a dark past, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about to come and bite him in the ass. \n\nEva cannot stay with a man whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll keep her in the dark. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the daughter of the man who runs the underground fighting circuit in Vegas, and there is iron in her that none of the Skulls suspects. Backing down from what she wants has never been in her nature, but Tiny is too far gone. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no hope of holding him.\n\nWhen Tiny and his boys are attacked on a drug run, he has no choice but to head to the woman he loves. Tiny doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know which of his men are alive or dead. He only knows his past has finally caught up with him. But how can he go back home without his daughterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s man? \n\nLives will be tested, and lives will be lost. Tiny will be pushed to the breaking point, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to make a choice. Who can he save when all seems lost?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f55d95ef3c2d36338bb4d85219e4be689ee18530","amp;dn":"Tiny+%28The+Skulls+%234%29+by+Sam+Crescent+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f55d95ef3c2d36338bb4d85219e4be689ee18530","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,93,149,239,60,45,54,51,139,180,216,82,25,228,190,104,158,225,133,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
