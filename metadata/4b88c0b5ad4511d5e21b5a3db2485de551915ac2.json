Despite the stripped-down arrangements, the album's sumptuous tone quality reflects Eno's growing virtuosity at handling the recording studio as an instrument in itself (ÃƒÂ  la Brian Wilson). \n\nThere are a few pop songs scattered here and there (&quot;St. Elmo's Fire,&quot; &quot;I'll Come Running,&quot; &quot;Golden Hours&quot;), but most of the album consists of deliberately paced instrumentals that, while often closer to ambient music than pop, are both melodic and rhythmic; many, like &quot;Sky Saw,&quot; &quot;In Dark Trees,&quot; and &quot;Little Fishes,&quot; are highly imagistic, like paintings done in sound that actually resemble their titles.\n\nLyrics are infrequent, but when they do pop up, they follow the free-associative style of albums past; this time, though, the humor seems less bizarre than gently whimsical and addled, fitting perfectly into the dreamlike mood of the rest of the album. \nMost of Another Green World is like experiencing a soothing, dream-filled slumber while awake, and even if some of the pieces have dark or threatening qualities, the moments of unease are temporary, like a passing nightmare whose feeling lingers briefly upon waking but whose content is forgotten. \n\nUnlike some of his later, full-fledged ambient work, Eno's gift for melodicism and tight focus here keep the entirety of the album in the forefront of the listener's consciousness, making it the perfect introduction to his achievements even for those who find ambient music difficult to enjoy.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - Sky Saw\n02 - Over Fire Island\n03 - St. Elmo's Fire\n04 - In Dark Trees\n05 - The Big Ship\n06 - I'll Come Running\n07 - Another Green World\n08 - Sombre Reptiles\n09 - Little Fishes\n10 - Golden Hours\n11 - Becalmed\n12 - Zawinul - Lava\n13 - Everything Merges With The Night\n14 - Spirits Drifting\n\n*2009 Virgin Records | 50999 6 84527 2 8 {2009 Virgin DSD Remaster}\n\n\nPersonnel:\nBrian Eno Ã¢â‚¬â€ guitars, synthesizer, tape, organ, pianos, bass pedals, synthetic &amp; electric percussions, treated rhythm generator, organs, electric elements &amp; unnatural sounds, bass guitar, vocals, producer\n\nwith:\nJohn Cale Ã¢â‚¬â€ viola\nPhil Collins Ã¢â‚¬â€ drums, percussion\nRobert Fripp Ã¢â‚¬â€ guitars\nPercy Jones Ã¢â‚¬â€ Fretless bass\nRod Melvin Ã¢â‚¬â€ Rhodes piano, piano\nPaul Rudolph Ã¢â‚¬â€ AnchoÃÂº bass, bass, snare drum, bass guitar &amp; Castanet guitars, guitar\nBrian Turrington Ã¢â‚¬â€ bass guitar &amp; piano\n\n\n\nSome Brian Eno Albums...\n\n\nBrian Eno - Ambient 1 Music For Airports (1978) [EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11612275/Brian_Eno_-_Ambient_1_Music_For_Airports_%281978%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11612275/Brian_Eno_-_Ambient_1_Music_For_Airports_%281978%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\nRobert Fripp &amp; Brian Eno - No Pussyfooting (1973) [2CD] [EAC-FLAC]:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11589447/Robert_Fripp__amp__Brian_Eno_-_No_Pussyfooting_%281973%29_%5B2CD%5D_%5BEAC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11589447/Robert_Fripp__amp__Brian_Eno_-_No_Pussyfooting_%281973%29_%5B2CD%5D_%5BEAC&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nEnjoy, SEED and SHARING...
