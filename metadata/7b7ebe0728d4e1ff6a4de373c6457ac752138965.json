Over the years, Rankin has built up an imposing portfolio of short stories. Appearing in crime magazines, written for personal appearances, or as one-off radio specials, they all resound with the singular energy and idiosyncratic characterisation of his best full-length novels. A previous collection, A Good Hanging, combined some first-rate tales with more workaday material, but this time round there isn't a single weak link, and the range of stories here is astonishing; this is a panoply of Rankin's approach to crime and mystery writing, and is that rare thing in short story collections: a book in which the tales can be read one after the other with ever-increasing pleasure.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/beggar_s_banquet.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/beggar_s_banquet.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nIan Rankin's Beggar's Banquet - S01 - E01 - Facing the Music, Part 1\nIan Rankin's Beggar's Banquet - S01 - E02 - Facing The Music, Part 2\nIan Rankin's Beggar's Banquet - S01 - E03 - Herbert In Motion, Part 1\nIan Rankin's Beggar's Banquet - S01 - E04 - Herbert In Motion, Part 2\nIan Rankin's Beggar's Banquet - S01 - E05 - The Hanged Man\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration Approx : 13mn 00s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b7ebe0728d4e1ff6a4de373c6457ac752138965","amp;dn":"Ian+Rankin%5C%27s+Beggar%5C%27s+Banquet+-+Audio+Books+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b7ebe0728d4e1ff6a4de373c6457ac752138965","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,126,190,7,40,212,225,255,106,77,227,115,198,69,122,199,82,19,137,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
