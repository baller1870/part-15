In the United States, nine out of every ten adults believe in God, and a recent Gallup poll found that about three out of four Americans believe in some form of telepathy, dÃƒÂ©jÃƒÂ  vu, ghosts, or past lives. Where does such supernatural thinking come from? Are we indoctrinated by our parents, churches, and media, or do such beliefs originate somewhere else? In SuperSense, award-winning cognitive scientist Bruce M. Hood reveals the science behind our beliefs in the supernatural.\n\nSuperstitions are common. Many of us cross our fingers, knock on wood, step around black cats, and avoid walking under ladders. John McEnroe refused to step on the white lines of a tennis court between points. Wade Boggs insisted on eating a chicken dinner before every Boston Red Sox game. President Barack Obama played a game of basketball the morning of his victory in the Iowa primary and continued the tradition on every subsequent election day.\n\nSupernatural thinking includes loftier beliefs as well, such as the sentimental value we place on photos of loved ones, wedding rings, and teddy bears. It also includes spiritual beliefs and the hope for an afterlife. But in this modern, scientific age, why do we hold on to these behaviors and beliefs?\n\nIt turns out that belief in things beyond what is rational or natural is common to humans and appears very early in childhood. In fact, according to Hood, this &quot;super sense&quot; is something we're born with to develop and is essential to the way we learn to understand the world. We couldn't live without it!\n\nOur minds are designed from the very start to think there are unseen patterns, forces, and essences inhabiting the world, and it is unlikely that any effort to get rid of supernatural beliefs, or the superstitious behaviors that accompany them, will be successful. These common beliefs and sacred values are essential in binding us together as a society because they help us to see ourselves connected to each other at a deeper level.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6f219d7591abb071b9abb48434488d22f85de95","amp;dn":"Supersense+-+Bruce+Hood.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6f219d7591abb071b9abb48434488d22f85de95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,242,25,215,89,26,187,7,27,154,187,72,67,68,136,210,47,133,222,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
