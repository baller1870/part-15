The film begins in the Arctic in January of one year and moves southward, concluding in Antarctica in the December of the same year. Along the way, it features the journeys made by three particular speciesÃ¢â‚¬â€the polar bear, African bush elephant and humpback whaleÃ¢â‚¬â€to highlight the threats to their survival in the face of rapid environmental change. A companion piece to the 2006 BBC/Discovery television series Planet Earth, the film uses many of the same sequences, though most are edited differently, and features previously unseen footage.\n\nEarth was co-directed by Alastair Fothergill, the executive producer of the television series, and Mark Linfield, the producer of Planet Earth's &quot;From Pole to Pole&quot; and &quot;Seasonal Forests&quot; episodes. It was co-produced by BBC Natural History Unit and Greenlight Media, with Discovery providing some of the funding. The same organisations collaborated on Fothergill's previous film, Deep Blue (2003), itself a companion to his 2001 television series on the natural history of the world's oceans, The Blue Planet. The British version of Earth was narrated by Patrick Stewart and the US version was narrated by James Earl Jones.\n\nEarth was released in cinemas internationally during the final quarter of 2007 and throughout 2008. In the United States, it became the first film released by the Disneynature label on 22 April 2009, which is Earth Day. With total worldwide box office revenue exceeding $100 million, Earth is the second-highest grossing nature documentary of all time.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14831093cff45dfa6cdf2661cb2b4eabda19a177","amp;dn":"Earth+%282007%29++Spanish+-+English+-+French+-+Portuguese","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14831093cff45dfa6cdf2661cb2b4eabda19a177","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,131,16,147,207,244,93,250,108,223,38,97,203,43,78,171,218,25,161,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
