It was directed and produced by Joel Musch. David Blane was also a producer of the film and starred as Link.\n\nThe Hero of Time Just had its WORLD PREMIERE on June 6th 2009 here in Atlanta.\n\nThe film was shot mainly on weekends over the span of about two years from August ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“04 through January ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“06. Post production started immediately and a rough edit void of any special fx was contrived early in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“07. The lack of visual fx and music help was challenging to the films progress; nevertheless the film printed a final draft in Oct ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“08 thanks to all the additional help from saints like George R. Powell (composer)!\n\nThe film is set in Hyrule where a young boy from the forest (Link) is beckoned by his dreams and the sage of the forest (Deku Tree) to venture to the city of Hyrule and seek princess ZeldaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s council. The evil Lord Ganondorf has plotted to overthrow the kingdom which propels Princess Zelda into hiding. Link endeavors to save them by pulling of the Master Sword in the Temple of Time. Consequently sending him 5 years into the future where Ganon now rules and threatens the future of the kingdom. Link must find a way to not only save his princess but the land heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fervent for.\n\n\nDisclaimer: The Hero of Time is not an official Legend of Zelda movie, and is in no way affiliated with or endorsed by Nintendo. The Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of Time, Link, Zelda, Ganon and related characters belong to Nintendo.\n\nNote: Nintendo had BMB Finishes remove the movie from Dailymotion, where they had posted it for FREE. I love Nintendo, but that was lame.\n\nOn the movie file itself:\nI ripped it from the Dailymotion site in HQ, and re-encoded it to a Divx AVI file.\nDimensions are 720 x 480. The best quality version out there, I think.\n\n\nFeel free to spread this movie as it is completely free, just don't remove my name as I took the time to rip and encode it. Enjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b413ca4d7d45202b57dbd3e616fdbcd2a263a841","amp;dn":"The+Hero+Of+Time+%282009%29+%5BLegend+of+Zelda+Fanmovie%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b413ca4d7d45202b57dbd3e616fdbcd2a263a841","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,19,202,77,125,69,32,43,87,219,211,230,22,253,188,210,162,99,168,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
