Written by Jacqueline Susann; Full-cast dramatisation starring Madeleine Potter, Stuart Milligan, Jamie Glover, Liza Ross and Barbara Barnes; Dramatised by Yvonne Antrobus.\n\nDolls - red or black, capsules or tablets, washed down with vodka or swallowed straight - are showbiz slang for tranquillizers, uppers and sleeping pills. For Anne, Jennifer and Neely, it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t matter how or which, as long as the pill bottle is within easy reach. A model, a singer and an actress become best friends when they are young and struggling at the bottom of their professions. By the time they reach the top, they discover thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no place left to go but down - into the Valley of the Dolls.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:105c8bc3d169af64bcd988830e113985389176d7","amp;dn":"Jacqueline+Susann+-+Valley+of+the+Dolls+%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"105c8bc3d169af64bcd988830e113985389176d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,92,139,195,209,105,175,100,188,217,136,131,14,17,57,133,56,145,118,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
