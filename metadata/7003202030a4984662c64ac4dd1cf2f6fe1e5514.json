It briefly introduces to the theory of continuous-time systems and the design methods for analog filters. Time-discrete systems, the basic structures of digital filters, sampling theorem, and the design of IIR filters are widely discussed. The author devotes important parts to the design of non-recursive filters and the effects of finite register length. The explanation of techniques like oversampling and noise shaping conclude the book. The author has substantially updated all chapters and added some important topics like Allpass filters. With an emphasize put on the practical implementation of theoretical concepts, the book is a reference for advanced students as well as practicing engineers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7003202030a4984662c64ac4dd1cf2f6fe1e5514","amp;dn":"Digital+Filters%3A+Basics+and+Design%2C+2nd+Edition+%5B2011%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7003202030a4984662c64ac4dd1cf2f6fe1e5514","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,3,32,32,48,164,152,70,98,198,74,196,221,28,242,246,254,30,85,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
