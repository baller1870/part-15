During this talk Stan 'predicts' such events such as the breaking up of what was, then, the country of Yugaslavia as well as the regionalisation of the world; for example my country of Australia is &quot;Region 4&quot;, along with South Africa and Israel. If anyone should doubt the reality of the NWO then this rare recording done some 30 years ago will certainly help them to realise that it is a reality and that people such as Stan were educating people as far back as 1977 regarding such things that have either come to pass and/or that is to come. If you are asked for any evidence of the NWO to skeptical friends etc simply ask them to examine their credit or bank card and or their medical cards (if any), they will see that in front of the main numbers follow a bunch of other numbers that begin with their respective 'Region Number', for instance mine shows the number four (see image) Or ask them to look on the back of such products as the DVDs they rent out, they will see their respective region as 'predicted' by Stan way back then. Stan may be out on his dates regarding weather patterns due to solar flares and other variables, however the scenerios he outlines could still be on the way. Stan does not claim to know it all and subjects that are subject to many differing factors etc, but he does speak very clear on things that he does know for certain.\n\nStan also discusses weather warfare and cyclones (hurricanes, such as the one that hit Darwin in the Northern Territory, Australia in 1974), Pine Gap, UFOs, the Club of Rome, physics and the Bible and the possible false 'Alien' visitation that is to come. He also gives his own personal testimony and shares some of his experiences among other things.\n\nAudio quality is poor to average simply because it was recorded on an early mono tape recorder and by the time I found the tape it had deteriorated very badly and thus had to re-case the tape before playing to record to new tapes before digitalising, however it is still listenable.\n\nHope it is of value to your respective research and insights.\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nStan Deyo - The Cosmic Conspiracy (Millenium Edition).pdf\n\nSize: 18.0mb\n\n[img]http://i971.photobucket.com/albums/ae194/geogaddi00/02.jpg[/img]\n\nRecruited by the Illuminati, Stan Deyo was taken secretly to Australia in 1971 to design &quot;flying saucer&quot; propulsion systems with them. Deyo reveals years later why &quot;they&quot; keep the alien/UFO agenda from the public. Many have investigated this huge conspiracy from the outside looking in - BUT, only one has come forward from an insider's perspective. Stan Deyo's The Cosmic Conspiracy is his testimony to you who would know the truth.... \n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSECTION I: Flights of Reasons\nCHAPTER 1 - Sightings and Suspicions\nCHAPTER 2 - Electro-Gravitic Propulsion\nCHAPTER 3 - Constructs of Reality\nCHAPTER 4 - Radiant Genius: Tesla\nCHAPTER 5 - Effecting Weather Warfare\nCHAPTER 6 - The 1982 Alignments\n\nSECTION II: Mysticism and Numerology: Mystery Babylon\nCHAPTER 1 - Centuries Of Darkness\nCHAPTER 2 - Orders of Illuminism\nCHAPTER 3 - Seal of Deception\nCHAPTER 4 - Model For 'Peace'\nCHAPTER 5 - It's All Happening\nCHAPTER 6 - Circles of Illuminati\n\nSECTION III: Not Of Earth: Ichthus\nCHAPTER 1 - In the Beginning\nCHAPTER 2 - Conflicts Bear Witness\nCHAPTER 3 - How to Survive\nCHAPTER 4 - Taken to Safety\nCHAPTER 5 - Horror With Grace\nCHAPTER 6 - Until Sin Dies\nCHAPTER 7 - Spread the Word\n\n'Survival Kit': Reading List For Section III\nAppendix No. 1 - New York Herald Tribune articles\nAppendix No. 2 - Interavia Electro-Gravitics article\nAppendix No. 3 - The Gravitics Situation (Gravity Rand Ltd.)\nAppendix No. 4 - Copies of the Maxfield-Teller letters\nAppendix No. 5 - Einstein's Relativity Error\nAppendix No. 6 - Electrodynamic Propulsion\nAppendix No. 7 - Regionalized and Adaptive Model of the Global World System\n\nMillennium Revision\n\n(excerpts available here: http://web.archive.org/web/20070909114317/http://au.geocities.com/psyberplasmic/index.html )\n\n----------------------\n\nStan Deyo - UFOs Are Here (1977).avi.torrent\n\nA torrent file to download the Australian UFO documentary from 1977 that inspired Stan Deyo to start revealing more information to the public and to eventually write The Cosmic Conspiracy.\n\nYou can stream or download this documentary here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.archive.org/details/StanDeyo-UfosAreHere&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.archive.org/details/StanDeyo-UfosAreHere&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a12a134a47d612ad65abaddaacc743578b57484d","amp;dn":"Stan+Deyo+-+The+Cosmic+Conspiracy+%281977+lecture+and+1997+ebook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a12a134a47d612ad65abaddaacc743578b57484d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,42,19,74,71,214,18,173,101,171,173,218,172,199,67,87,139,87,72,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
