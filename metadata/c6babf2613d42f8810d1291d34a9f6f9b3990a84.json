In death Cash is growing ever \nstronger by the day, and rightfully so.\n\nRocks Off got word today that the ten billionth song to be purchased on iTunes was one of Cash's \ncompositions. The buyer, Georgia grandfather Louie Sulcer, received a phone call from Apple honcho \nSteve Jobs, another from Cash's daughter Roseanne, and a $10,000 gift card for the online music store. \nNo word on what the exact song was, but we hope it was our favorite Cash track, &quot;Man In Black,&quot; \nthe lyrics of which are emblazoned in tattoo ink across our chest.\n\nThis week producer Rick Rubin's influential American label released what he has said is the last \nof the sessions he recorded with Cash close to his death. The new American VI: Ain't No Grave is \na stirring and fitting coda to the work that Rubin and Cash were doing at the time of the singer's \ndeath. Starting with 1994's inaugural American Recordings album, the pair ran through five albums of \nCash doing both traditional songs and covers of songs by such disparate artists as Glenn Danzig, \nSoundgarden, Beck, Neil Diamond and most famously a version of Nine Inch Nails' &quot;Hurt.&quot;\n\n\nThe new Grave features backing work from the Avett Brothers, Smoky Hormel (Beck), and Matt Sweeney \nformerly of the indie band Chavez. This last round of tracks includes a song each from Sheryl Crow \nand Kris Kristofferson. It ends with the sweet Hawaiian lilt of &quot;Aloha Oe,&quot; written by the last \nofficial monarch of the islands, Queen Lili'uokalani.\n\nAs dour and foreboding as Cash's image was at times, he was one hell of a funny guy. In interviews \nhe was always quick to turn a phrase and he was known to be a hellraiser on tours back in his Sun \nRecords heyday. When you partied with people like Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis, you had to up \nyour game just a tad. Up until his death, Cash was a humorous and warm fellow. On some of the tracks \nhe did with Rubin, you can hear him cracking jokes to his backing band before and after songs.\n__________\n\n1. Aint No Grave\n\n2. Redemption Day\n\n3.
