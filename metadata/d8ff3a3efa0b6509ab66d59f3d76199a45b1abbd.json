Mr. Rouquier, an admirer of the great American documentary film maker Robert Flaherty, doesn't attempt to discover drama as he shoots. Instead, he works with nonprofessional performers - in this case, farmers - who act out staged sequences that correspond to events in their own lives.\n\n''Farrebique'' recorded the end of an era as three generations of the Rouquier family debated whether or not to bring electricity to their farm or to use the money to repair the old farmhouse. In the course of four seasons, one son courted his future bride, the old grandfather prepared for death, and life went on in a series of idyllically photographed scenes, some shot in stop-motion, which celebrated the cyclical nature of all existence.\n\n''Biquefarre,'' which includes brief clips from the first film, is less self- consciously poetic and more matter- of-fact in the manner in which it documents the lives of the surviving Rouquiers and their new in-laws and children. The old stone farmhouse is still there but empty. The family has moved nearby to a new, modern house that is, comparatively speaking, a state-of-the-art farmhouse. So is the farm itself, where cows are milked mechanically, the feed is vitamin-enriched and the pesticides may be contaminating the farmers and the landscapes as well the pests.\n\nThe major ''event'' of ''Biquefarre'' is the family's ultimately successful attempt to increase their holdings by the purchase of Biquefarre, an adajcent farm property that will allow them to increase production and survive in the increasingly competitive agricultural market. In one of the film's most effective scenes, Raoul, the old bachelor who is selling Biquefarre and moving to Toulouse, tells a community meeting that all farmland should be owned by the community to insure more equitable opportunities for all farmers. He is shouted down as a possible Marxist.\n\nThe relationships of the characters are not always clear. There also are times when ''Biquefarre'' will seem curiously old-fashioned to audiences now accustomed to the supposedly inobtrusive camera of cinema verite. Yet the very self-consciousness of the nonprofessional actors - we are never for a second led to believe they aren't aware of the camera - as well as the gaps in what passes for a narrative, combine to produce a sense of authenticity that often gets lost in far more slick, contemporary ''fact'' films.\n\n==============================================\n\n--- File Information ---                                                        \nFile Name:                                      Biquefarre.avi                     \nFile Size (in bytes):                           725,104,446                     \n                                                                                \n--- Container Information ---                                                   \nBase Type (e.g &quot;AVI&quot;):                          AVI(.AVI)                 \nSubtype (e.g &quot;OpenDML&quot;):                        AVI v1.0,                   \nTotal System Bitrate (kbps):                    0            \nNumber of Audio Streams:                        1       \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Type(e.g. &quot;DIV3&quot;):                  DX50              \nVideo Codec Name(e.g. &quot;DivX 3, Low-Motion&quot;):    DivX 5.0.5              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):                            1:29:36                \nPixel Aspect Ratio (&quot;PAR&quot;):                     1.000                     \nDisplay Aspect Ratio (&quot;DAR&quot;):                   1.364                     \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):                           970                 \nFrames Per Second:                              25.000          \nMPEG-4 (&quot;MPEG-4&quot; or &quot;&quot;):                        MPEG-4                   \nB-VOP (&quot;B-VOP&quot; or &quot;&quot;):                                        \nQPel (&quot;QPel&quot; or &quot;&quot;):                                          \nGMC (&quot;GMC&quot; or &quot;&quot;):                                             \nNVOP (&quot;NVOP&quot; or &quot;&quot;):                                          \nH264 (&quot;H264&quot; or &quot;&quot;):\t                                            \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:              0.102&quot;                     \n                                                                                \nMPEG-2 (&quot;MPEG-2&quot; or &quot;&quot;):                                           \nInterlaced (&quot;I/L&quot; or &quot;&quot;):                                      \nProgressive (&quot;Prog&quot; or &quot;&quot;):                                   \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec (e.g. &quot;AC3&quot;):                       0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):                         48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):                            96                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):            CBR            \nAudio Channel Count (e.g. &quot;2&quot; for stereo):      2\n\n==============================================\n\nOther related torrents here: http://thepiratebay.se/user/rpessoa","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8ff3a3efa0b6509ab66d59f3d76199a45b1abbd","amp;dn":"Biquefarre+%28Georges+Rouquier%2C+1983%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8ff3a3efa0b6509ab66d59f3d76199a45b1abbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,255,58,62,250,11,101,9,171,102,213,159,61,118,25,154,69,177,171,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
