Waking up after a while, he sees that the world he knew before is gone. Inhabit it now dead, who have only one desire Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to feast on the flesh of those who are still alive. This situation pushes Rick to go in search of their family and to meet new and incomprehensible world, which often preceded by complex moral dilemmas and choices, and to consider, from whom comes the greatest threat Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from the rotting corpses that want your flesh, or from those who, like himself, to survive.\n\nFor Previous Issues Click Here!\nThe Walking Dead #112 [2013]\nPublisher: Image Comics | English | CBR | 28 MB ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe46da20488627d5e325398760823e15c1fa62ee","amp;dn":"The+Walking+Dead+Issue+112+%5B2013%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe46da20488627d5e325398760823e15c1fa62ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,70,218,32,72,134,39,213,227,37,57,135,96,130,62,21,193,250,98,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
