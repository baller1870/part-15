This time Parsons' message concerns the fact that everyone lives in a parasitic society, where it's every man for himself. Those who can't fend for themselves simply won't survive in a world where the kindness of the human spirit is rapidly deteriorating. On this album, though, the songs are weaker and are less effective in bringing out the album's complex idea. As it does have its moments, Vulture Culture lacks in cohesiveness and strength both lyrically and, to a lesser extent, musically. &quot;Let's Talk About Me&quot; addresses the theme in its words, but the choppy rhythm takes away the attractiveness that could have been. The instrumental &quot;Hawkeye&quot; adds life and contrast to the album at just the right time. The most appealing song, &quot;Days Are Numbers (The Traveller)&quot; with vocalist Chris Rainbow at the helm, combines simplicity with a timeless chorus making for a truly beautiful ballad. Even though Parsons' theme is revealed, it's done so with less clarity and doesn't quite hit home. Without the usual balance of absorbing lyrics and well-maintained music, Vulture Culture remains one of this band's less prolific albums. \n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img83.imageshack.us/img83/4595/vulturecultureew9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img83.imageshack.us/img83/4595/vulturecultureew9.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\n01.
