The group also relied on outside songwriters for its material, drifting into MOR covers of oldies by the end of the '60s, and was generally a sort of textbook of unhipness during a time when self-contained rock bands were becoming the norm. In a sense, Jay &amp; the Americans were the original &quot;oldies&quot; act -- organized at the transition of the 1950s into the 1960s, the group sounded like a throwback to that earlier decade, at a time when harmony vocal groups -- at least those without some guitar wattage accompanying them -- were already becoming old hat. ....\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:aifoxqe5ldae~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:aifoxqe5ldae~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAlbum Review by Bruce Eder:\n\nAs far as it goes, this 26-minute CD is pretty good, as a sort of bite-sized account of the group's chart hits -- about the same length and ten songs that an oldies station might program in a &quot;special&quot; on the group's history. The mastering is better than decent, which is a surprise, as this release pre-dates the general upgrade that began in the mid-'90s -- the group's tracks always translated well to CD, in any era of the format, and only &quot;She Cried&quot; doesn't quite measure up to the quality of the rest. There are no notes at all, not a surprise considering the seven dollar list price, but if this material isn't reasonably self-explanatory, then there's no '60s rock music that is. \n\nTrack List:\n\n01. She Cried\n02. Only in America\n03. Come a Little Bit Closer\n04. Let's Lock the Door (And Throw Away the Key)\n05. Think of the Good Times\n06. Cara, Mia\n07. Sunday and Me\n08. Crying\n09. This Magic Moment\n10.
