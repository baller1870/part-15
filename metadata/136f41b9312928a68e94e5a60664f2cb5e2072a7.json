(One example, a Kyrie, takes on a more sophisticated approach to multi-voice singing, using more independent individual lines in the style of the Codex Calixtinus.)\n(http://www.operatoday.com/content/2007/09/le_chant_des_te.php)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:136f41b9312928a68e94e5a60664f2cb5e2072a7","amp;dn":"Ensemble+Organum+-+Le+Chant+des+Templiers+%282006%2C+APE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"136f41b9312928a68e94e5a60664f2cb5e2072a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,111,65,185,49,41,40,166,142,148,229,166,6,100,242,203,94,32,114,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
