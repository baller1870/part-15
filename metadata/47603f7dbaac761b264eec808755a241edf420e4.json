Krall breezes through a few bossa nova standards, most notably &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot; ( here gender-reversed to &quot;The Boy...&quot; ) and the title track ( originally &quot;Corcovado&quot; ), both penned by the legendary Antonio Carlos Jobim.  QUIET NIGHTS isn't solely a Brazilian-themed outing, however, as Krall also spends plenty of time in the comfortable realm of the Great American Songbook, offering up elegant orchestral renditions of &quot;I've Grown Accustomed to His Face&quot; and the Bacharach/David gem &quot;Walk On By&quot; that benefit from her supremely smoky vocals and graceful delivery. ~ CD Universe\n\nAlbum review \nDiana Krall's albums should come with a warning label: Do not use while operating heavy machinery. \n\nThis is not a knock: Krall's round, relaxed voice is a nuanced instrument ideally suited for, as this album's title indicates, quiet nights.  With this collection delving exclusively into the worlds of classic ballads and bossa nova, the singer is in an even quieter place than usual. \n\nWhich is a bit of a shame.  There's nothing terribly wrong with Krall's breathy take on Antonio Carlos Jobim with a faithfully bouncy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Boy From Ipanema&quot; and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œQuiet Nights&quot;; the songs glide by with such an evenhanded subtlety it's almost subliminal. The only mild frustration is, other than Krall's tackling of the Portuguese-language ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEste Seu Olhar&quot; from JoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o Gilberto, there isn't really anything new or unexpected here. \n\nBurt Bacharach's ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWalk On By&quot; gets a slightly sassy knock from Krall's vocal turn, but any seductive kick she could have offered gets lost among the soft-focused string arrangements that shadow the whole album. \n\nStill, Krall is in fine voice throughout, and her delicate piano work gets time to shine as well, notably on the bossa nova standard ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSo Nice.&quot; While fans looking for a classic, none- too-jarring soundtrack for a romantic evening surely will follow this record happily into their good night, Krall has offered us more than that in the past. ~ All About Jazz Publicity\n\nSome music is intended to paint a romantic scene ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a candlelit dinner, a walk along a moonlit beach. Quiet Nights ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Diana KrallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s twelfth album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t about that. Using Brazil as a musical point of reference, the award-winning pianist and singer is not suggesting a night out; she means to stay in.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt's not coy. It's not ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“peel me a grape,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ little girl stuff. I feel this albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s very womanly ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ like you're lying next to your lover in bed whispering this in their ear.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nSheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not kidding. From KrallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s refreshing version of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhere or When,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to an utterly soul-stilling rendition of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re My Thrill,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the ten songs on Quiet Nights are disarming in their intimacy. Even those already familiar with the breathy vocals and rhythmic lilt in KrallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and now there are millions ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ will be taken aback by just how far the music pushes, unabashedly, into the realm of sweet surrender. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a sensual, downright erotic record and it's intended to be that way.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nKrall is the first to credit the musical team she assembled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ her loyal quartet, ace producer Tommy LiPuma, engineer Al Schmitt plus legendary arranger Claus Ogerman ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ for much of the seductive power on Quiet Nights. But thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a deeper, palpable sense of maturity that she brought to the recording as well. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMost of my singing and playing on the album is really just first or second takes. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“You're My Thrill,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ was a second take ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œToo Marvelous,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ first take.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s completely matured,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says Tommy LiPuma, who should know, having first worked with Krall in 1994. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEven in the past few years. She approaches her vocal phrasing much more like an instrumentalist than a straight singer. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in her reading of the lyrics, and the timbre of her voice, much more misty like Peggy Lee in her mature period.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ( ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI didn't want to over sing -- I was drawing also from Julie London very strongly on this album,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Krall confesses, noting that such influences are not always conscious on her part. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt just came out that way.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ) ~  Arlene Garcia \n\nPersonnel:\nLarry Corbett\nSid Page\nBruce Dukov\nJosefina Vergara\nMatt Funes - viola\nKatia Popov\nReggie Hamilton\nTereza Stanislav - violin\nMario De Leon\nCecilia Tsan\nDarius Campo\nDrew Dembowski\nEarle Dumler - oboe\nSteve Kujala\nEvan Wilson\nJoel Pargman\nSue Ranney\nKate Reddish\nTammy Hatwan\nAmy Wickman\nBrad Warnaar - French horn\nEd Meares - bass guitar\nPeter Kent\nLiane Mautner\nSteve Richards\nNico Abondolo\nDan Smith\nTrevor Handy\nRick Todd\nThomas Diener\nDavid Walther\nRazdan Kuyumjian\nVickie Miskolczy\nVanessa Freebairn-Smith - cello\nCaroline Campbell\nRudy Stein\nTiffany Yi Hu\nDan Neufeld\nHeather Clark - alto flute, bass flute\nJoseph Meyer\nDoug Tornquist - tuba\nEun Mee Ahn\nCharles Bisharat\nDavid Shostac\nGeri Rotella\nJanet Lakatos\nMari Tsumura\nYue Deng\nAntony Cooke\nBarbra Porter\nBill Lane\nDavid Ewart\nGil Romero\nHelen Nightengale\nRobert Zimmiti - vibraphone\nTimothy Landauer\nTodd Marda\n\nDiana Krall - Quiet Nights Tracks:\n01 Where Or When\n02 Too Marvelous For Words\n03 I've Grown Accustomed To His Face\n04 The Boy From Ipanema\n05 Walk On By\n06 You're My Thrill\n07 Este Seu Olhar\n08 So Nice\n09 Quiet Nights\n10 Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out To Dry\n11 How Can You Mend A Broken Heart\n12 Everytime We Say Goodbye","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47603f7dbaac761b264eec808755a241edf420e4","amp;dn":"Diana+Krall+-+Quiet+Nights+%282009%29+%5BJazz+Vocals%5D%5B320+kbps%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47603f7dbaac761b264eec808755a241edf420e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,96,63,125,186,172,118,27,38,78,236,128,135,85,162,65,237,244,32,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
