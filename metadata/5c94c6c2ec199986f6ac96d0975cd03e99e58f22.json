Published by Criterion as a currently-unavailable three-disc set, with a new translation.\n\nFrom Criterion:\n\n&quot;When Scenes from a Marriage (1974) was first released theatrically in the U.S., it held the voyeuristic thrill of watching a live couple flailing themselves before our eyes. The nearly three-hour film seemed to do for the institution of marriage what the spectacle of the LoudsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ disintegration on PBS was doing for family life in An American Family. Indeed, in the long takes and ferreting camerawork, it bore certain resemblances not only to cinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ma vÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ritÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©-style documentary, but to certain passages in John CassavetesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Faces (1968) or A Woman Under the Influence (1974). The comparison of Cassavetes to Ingmar Bergman may sound far-fetched, yet both shared around that time an interest in scenes where characters would go past the ostensible hostile climax into a confusing, unpredictable zone of appeasement and retrenchment. Not that Bergman had ever shied from long dialogue scenes, but this time he seemed to be experimenting with a more impromptu, reactive camera, intent on keeping up with the actors as they straggled through interiors looking for some safe nook, as for a boxing corner between rounds.&quot;\n\nWritten and directed by Ingmar Bergman, cinematography by Sven Nykvist, starring Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson, and with cameos from repertory members Bibi Andersson and Gunnel Lindblom.\n\nEXTRAS:\n- 15-minute interview with Ingmar Bergman\n- 25-minute interview with Ullmann &amp; Josephson\n- 15-minute interview with Bergman scholar Peter Cowie\n\nI've seen people ask for this a few times in the comments of other Bergman torrents, so hopefully it stays alive for a while. It can be hard to find the five-hour cut with Criterion's translation.\n\nYes, it's native Academy, 1.37:1. Not pan and scanned.
