The indicators used in the software are the same you would use in a real tournament situation, but are quite different from a ring or cash game.\n\nPoker calculator designed for ring games simply cannot offer the critical information used to make correct decisions in tournaments. Correct decision making at game critical intersects is what makes a tournament player successful. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHere are some of the features Tournament Indicator offers an online tournament player: \n\nInstant MZone Calculations\nNow you will know what MZone you are in as well as every other players&amp;#039; at your table. Depending on which MZone you are in can drastically alter your strategy, and the same is for your opponents. Only now, you are the only one with ALL the critical information at the table. \nPlayer Profiling\nIn early tournament play you can learn a lot about your opponents by watching everything they do. Harder said than done, but Tournament Indicator does it all for you tracking VPIP%, Aggression, PFR%, showdown wins, and more. All these combined make for real-time player classifications that you can use against your opponents at the right time. \nTilt Factor Monitoring\nNew to poker calculator also is Tournament Indicator&amp;#039;s ability to provide you with insight as to your opponent&amp;#039;s tilt potential. By tracking hand streak in wins and losses and a tally on the player&amp;#039;s stack over the last 10 hands gives you even more insight into that players current psyche. \nMatchCard Showdown\nDifferent criteria enter into the decision making process as a tournament winds down. Whether you are short stack, big stack or other, in the money or on the bubble, you will be faced with numerous all-in confrontations as part of the normal play of tournaments. What Tournament Indicator&amp;#039;s MatchCard feature offers is a quick view of potential hands you might be up against. \nOdds Calculations\nHoldem Indicator set the standard for quick, easy to understand odds display while incorporating a visual display of comparing win odds to pot odds in each betting round. Tournament Indicator uses that same technology to give users the most relevant information with proven, reliable technology. \nMiniView and Customized Settings\nYou won&amp;#039;t feel squeezed on your computer screen as Tournament Indicator can be minimized on the game window. We like our profile settings but if you don&amp;#039;t, just go ahead and adjust the profiling, and tilt factor settings to where they make more sense for you. \nVideo Tutorial Guide\nTournament Indicator introduces the Video Tutorial Guide compiled by Marty Smith. Watch these quick, informative videos and you will be using Tournament Indicator to it&amp;#039;s full extent in your very first tournament. \n\nWin Odds: Calculated with a sophisticated mathematical algorithm based on your pocket cards, the community cards, and the number of players in the hand. \nPot Odds: Pot odds is simply a ratio of the amount of money in the pot compared with how much money it takes to call. The higher the ratio, the better your pot odds are. If there are $12 in the pot and it costs $4 to call then you are getting 3:1 odds ( winnings : &quot;cost to stay in&quot;). This can be translated to a percentage, representing the size of your contribution in the new pot. It will be 25% in the above example. \nYour/Opponent hands at showdown: These numbers represent the probabilities of hitting a particular hand for you AND your opponents at showdown. For example, if it shows 20 on flush for you and 30 for your opponents, it means that you have a 20% probability of getting your flush, while your opponents collectively have a 30% chance of hitting a flush. \nEV: Expected Value for your hole cards. Expected value is the average amount of big bets this hand will make or lose. So for example, AA from the small blind in a 3/6 game will make on average 2.71 times the big blind, or $16.20 per hand (2.71 * $6). 22 from the button (D or Dealer position) however, will make -0.12 EV, or -$0.72 in a 3/6 game (6 * -0.12). This data was extracted from Poker Room&amp;#039;s EV Page. Thus, these statistics are actually compiled from live table data instead of simulations. \nGroup: It&amp;#039;s another way to describe your hole cards strength. In the book of Hold&amp;#039;em Poker for Advanced Players by David Sklansky, he divides the starting hands into 9 groups. Group 1 is the strongest; group 9 is the weakest. By only playing poker hands that have profitable EV, you will certainly improve your Texas Hold&amp;#039;em game. Please remember however, that this is a compilation of EV for the average player, so they are just representative of long term statistics and not Texas Hold&amp;#039;em facts. You will still need to play your poker hands accordingly, which means you need to observe your opponents, and play as the flop sees fit. \nOUTs: OUTs refer to the unseen cards still left in the deck that will improve your hand after the Flop. As you might guess, the more cards left in the deck that will improve your hand, the better. That&amp;#039;s why, after the Flop, you want to stay with hands that can be improved in a number of ways. The more outs, or ways your hand can potentially improve on the Turn or the River, the better your chances are of winning the pot. By counting your outs, you can do a very rough, quick calculation to estimate your percent chance of improving your hand after the Flop, and hopefully having a winning hand. Knowing how likely (or unlikely) you are to improve will help you make a better decision about how much (or little) to invest in the hand. Tournament Indicator shows you the Total Outs and what the Outs are. \nPosition: Tournament Indicator shows your position after flop. For a full size table (7-10 players), the first three seats after the button would be Early. The button and the two seats before it would be Late, and in between is the Middle. For short-handed tables (5-6 players), Early and Late position are the first and last two positions. For tables with 2-4 players, Early and Late position are the first and last position. \n\nSupported Rooms\nPartyPoker\nEmpirePoker\nFull Tilt Poker\nPokerStars\nEverest Poker\nBodog Poker\nSvenska Spels Poker\nPacific Poker\nAbsolute Poker\nVegas Poker 247\nLuckyAce Poker\nLadbrokes Poker\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:678b0f9e4ae6f3c98fad864ebf4111891ebc3871","amp;dn":"Poker-Tournament.Indicator.v1.2.4.WinAll.Cracked-ZARDOZ.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"678b0f9e4ae6f3c98fad864ebf4111891ebc3871","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,139,15,158,74,230,243,201,143,173,134,78,191,65,17,137,30,188,56,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
