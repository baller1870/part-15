Like every climber you will come to the point where you want to leave the climbing gym and exchange plastic handles for real rock beneath your palms. You want to breathe in fresh air, enjoy the sun, wind, and the scenery surrounding you. But in order to do that safely, you first have to train for it. When rock climbing, unlike indoor climbing, you are responsible for protecting yourself. While this promises excitement and a more intense experience, it also requires additional knowledge and both physical and mental strength.\r\n\r\nThis book will cover the right techniques, crucial safety procedures, and essential equipment that allows you to successfully master the first steps in rock climbing. Numerous photos illustrate the challenging and complex sequences and movements in an easy-to-understand way.A brief introduction to indoor climbing is also included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7678425d3e3808c46267e943f9dee59c2dc8b098","amp;dn":"Rock+Climbing+-+Technique+%2C+Equipment%2C+Safety+%282016%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7678425d3e3808c46267e943f9dee59c2dc8b098","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,120,66,93,62,56,8,196,98,103,233,67,249,222,229,156,45,200,176,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
