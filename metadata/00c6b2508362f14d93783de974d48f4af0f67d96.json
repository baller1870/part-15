That harrowing tale described how Healy by discovering chess, escaped alcoholism, violence and crime. Many fans have wondered how Healy did as a chess player. In this book Healy uses over a hundred of his own games to show how unusual tactics or defensive motifs can turn the tide in any position. Along with the games the author describes in eloquent but brutal language the beautiful, sometimes terrible world of chess. The prologue Blood Sport is a fine piece of vintage Healy non-fiction. A must-buy book for chess lovers, tactics buffs and Healy fans.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Coffeehouse-Chess-Tactics-John-Healy/dp/905691328X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351627753&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=coffe+house+chess+tactics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Coffeehouse-Chess-Tactics-John-Healy/dp/905691328X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351627753&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=coffe+house+chess+tactics&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00c6b2508362f14d93783de974d48f4af0f67d96","amp;dn":"Coffeehouse+Chess+Tactics+-+John+Healy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00c6b2508362f14d93783de974d48f4af0f67d96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,198,178,80,131,98,241,77,147,120,61,233,116,212,143,74,240,246,125,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
