Celebrated by supporters as a crusader for free speech and denounced by detractors as little more than a poor man's Alice Cooper, Manson was the latest in a long line of shock rockers, rising to the top of the charts on a platform of sex, drugs, and Satanism. Though widely dismissed by critics, his brand of metal nevertheless struck a major chord with the youth market, and he became a mainstream anti-hero on the strength of a masterfully orchestrated marketing campaign, much to the chagrin of conservative politicians and concerned parents. Such attention pushed many of his songs -- including &quot;The Dope Show,&quot; &quot;The Beautiful People,&quot; and a cover of the Eurythmics' &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot; -- into the upper reaches of the modern rock charts during his heyday. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tStorm Records\nCatalog:\t\tSYO 007\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\n01.Mechanical Animals\n02.Antichrist Superstar\n03.The Horrible People\n04.I Don't Like The Drugs (But The Drugs Like Me)\n05.The Tourniquet Prosthetic (Dance Mix)\n06.Irresponsible Hate Anthem\n07.The Beautiful People\n08.Disaaaociative\n09.Great Big White World\n10.Dried Up, Tied And Dead To The World\n11.Little Horn\n12.The Dope Show\n13.1996\n14.The Last Day On Earth\n15.Fundamentally Loathsome\n16.Kiddie Grinder\n17.Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4df6f4cf5c34e050ee1b89d23907ad151baf1a87","amp;dn":"Marilyn+Manson+-+Very+Best+%281999%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4df6f4cf5c34e050ee1b89d23907ad151baf1a87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,246,244,207,92,52,224,80,238,27,137,210,57,7,173,21,27,175,26,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
