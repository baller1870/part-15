Her very proper suitor expects a proper English family and the perfect Dickensian Christmas, which leaves the lovely widow with a slight problem. The last thing Camille wants is for the prince to meet her unconventional relatives. But with the aid of a troupe of actors, Camille intends to pull off a Christmas deception of massive proportions. At least until Grayson Elliot shows up. A dozen years ago, he declared his love on the day before her marriage to another man, then vanished from her life. Now heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s back, gate-crashing CamilleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s already chaotic house party, playing absolute havoc with her scheme Ã¢â‚¬â€ and with her heart. Because for Grayson, losing Camille once was quite bad enough. Losing her twice? Unthinkable. And heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find a way to show her they belong together Ã¢â‚¬â€ for this season, and every Christmas yet to comeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nFormats provided are:\n.ePub -\nCompatible with most eReaders including the Apple iPad.
