G. Wells, addressing ideas of society and community, human nature and identity, religion, Darwinism, and eugenics.\n\nWhen the novel was written in the late 19th century, EnglandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s scientific community was engulfed by debates on animal vivisection. Interest groups were even formed to tackle the issue: the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection was formed two years after the publication of the novel. The novel is presented as a discovered manuscript, introduced by the narratorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nephew; it then Ã¢â‚¬ËœtranscribesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ the tale.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5919a1b659159e86068f39423c0e2976da04a4c9","amp;dn":"The+Island+of+Doctor+Moreau+by+H+G+Wells+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5919a1b659159e86068f39423c0e2976da04a4c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,25,161,182,89,21,158,134,6,143,57,66,60,14,41,118,218,4,164,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
