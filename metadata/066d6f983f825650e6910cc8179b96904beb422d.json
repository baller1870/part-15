Not just because the competition has     \n          thinned, but because Underclass Hero is just that great. Though nobody would accuse  \n          lead singer Deryck Whibley of sounding like Green Day&amp;#039;s Billy Joe Armstrong, he bites\n          into the politically charged lyrics that course through this 14-track set as hard:   \n          &quot;March of the Dogs,&quot; &quot;The Jester,&quot; and &quot;Confusion and Frustration in Modern Times&quot;   \n          are served up with a spasmodic sneer (and, in the case of the latter, a lyric that   \n          will resonate with legions of the exasperated: &quot;Confusion&amp;#039;s all I see/Frustration    \n          surrounds me/Solution&amp;#039;s bid farewell/Sedation? What the hell&quot;), and the title track  \n          comes bounding out of stereo speakers with both outrage and lit-up energy. On the    \n          lighter side, the ballad &quot;With Me&quot; is sweet and simple enough to recall Plain White  \n          Ts, and &quot;Ma Poubelle,&quot; a French ditty, strikes a weird Beatle-y chord before rapidly \n          dissolving. Does Sum 41 add up to the hottest pop-punk band going, then? For sure. Do\n          the math. --Tammy La Gorce                                                           \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                 Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,            \n                 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality         \n                 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!                  \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n               Track Listing....:                                                              \n                 01.Underclass hero             [03:14]                                        \n                 02.Walking disaster            [04:46]                                        \n                 03.Speak of the devil          [03:59]                                        \n                 04.Dear father                 [03:52]                                        \n                 05.Count your last blessings   [03:04]                                        \n                 06.Ma poubelle                 [00:56]                                        \n                 07.March of the dogs           [03:09]                                        \n                 08.The jester                  [02:48]                                        \n                 09.With me                     [04:51]                                        \n                 10.Pull the curtain            [04:19]                                        \n                 11.King of contradiction       [01:41]                                        \n                 12.Best of me                  [04:26]                                        \n                 13.Confusion and frustration   [03:46]                                        \n                    in modern times                                                            \n                 14.So long goodbye             [03:02]                                        \n                 15.Look at me                  [04:04]                                        \n                                                       ____                                    \n                                                                                               \n                                               51:57 min                                       \n                                                80,6 MB                                        ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:066d6f983f825650e6910cc8179b96904beb422d","amp;dn":"Sum41-Underclass_Hero-%28Retail%29-2007-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"066d6f983f825650e6910cc8179b96904beb422d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,109,111,152,63,130,86,80,230,145,12,200,23,155,150,144,75,235,66,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
