We will start by going over the process of understanding and working with panoramic matte paintings using camera projections. \n\nWe begin by shooting our plate, processing our images, stitching them with PtGui and building a simple custom camera rig using Maya and NUKE. With that we will create the required projections in the scene. Then we will model all of the geometry required, extract the elements, and setup a 3D scene inside NUKE. \n\nWe continue by adding in various other objects and finishing with a cityscape. Over the whole tutorial we will take a look at many different tools and techniques used with Photoshop, Maya, PtGui &amp; NUKE in a matte painting workflow, which can be used in your own personal projects.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img189/3379/psnn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img189/3379/psnn.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, All SilverTorrentHD Encoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers \n\n:Support:\nTook 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 24 Hours to Upload &amp; Seed\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 10 Seconds to say&quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5216826550515cabd820e78dd4910797af9cc48e","amp;dn":"Digital+Tutors+-+Creating+Panoramic+Matte+Painting+Projections+i","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5216826550515cabd820e78dd4910797af9cc48e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,22,130,101,80,81,92,171,216,32,231,141,212,145,7,151,175,156,196,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
