In the Name of the Dance (04:22)\n\nAnother masterpiece by the highly talented Ms. Tucker. As usual, SJÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s musical lyrics and accompaniments are out of this world. The caliber of her creations never ceases to amaze me. This diminutive woman has a huge stage presence that is carried through to her CDs.\n\nBlessings is no exception. This CD is a collection of very usable ritual enhancements. (I was honored to call South at a recent handfasting, and played SJÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s CD after the ceremony for the newly joined couple during the reception line.) There are a few other styles of composition thrown in, a fairy-tale type myth is one of them, and may just be my favorite on the entire disc. Some of the ritual selections actually gave me goose-bumps (and still do after repeated listening) with the power they call up.\n\nI have only one complaint about Blessings. It was TOO short. The music was all over way too early and left me thirsting for more.
