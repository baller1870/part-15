Singer Justin Furstenfeld packs enough melodrama into &quot;Weight of the World&quot; to shame Bono and Meat Loaf combined. Over a spare martial beat, Furstenfeld's clenchedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“teeth vocals might make for decent tragicomedy if not for selfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“indulgent pathos like &quot;I stole the pillowcase to clean this mess I've made of someone's dream.&quot; He growls out a torture fantasy in &quot;Dirt Room&quot; and gets sensitive on &quot;My Never.&quot; But even Furstenfeld's pleas for redemption in &quot;Blue Skies&quot; can't stop this downward spiral.
