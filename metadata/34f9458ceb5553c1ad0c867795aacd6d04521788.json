Don't hit and run!\nLet me know what you think by a comment.\n\nI had this album before in a better bitrate. But for some strange reason (maybe not for Bill Gates and Microsoft), my computer in its own wisdom decided to erase the folder.\nI've searched the net and this is what I've found. For sensitive ears the bitrate of 128 may be inadequate. I've listened to it all and it sounds allright.\nThere is another torrent &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3348532/Brassed_Off_-_Grimethorpe_Colliery_Band&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3348532/Brassed_Off_-_Grimethorpe_Colliery_Band&lt;/a&gt;\nwich seems to be in 160 bps. But we've got stuck on 73,9% download for quite some time there.\nSo, this is better than nothing.\nI had some problems in sorting out the tracklisting but I think it's correct now. If you find any errors, please let me know.\n\n\nBrassed Off - Original Soundtrack @128\n\n01  Death or Glory (Robert Browne Hall)\n02  Sad Old Day (Trevor Jones)\n03  Floral Dance (Katie Moss)\n04  Aforementioned Essential Items (Trevor Jones)\n05  En Aranjuez con Tu Amor (Joaquin Rodrigo) Solo flugel - Paul Hughes\n06  Years of Coal (Trevor Jones)\n07  March of the Cobblers (Bob Barrett and Edrich Siebert)\n08  There's More Important Things in Life (Trevor Jones)\n09  Cross of Honour (William Rimmer)\n10  Jerusalem (Sir Charles Hubert Hastings Parry/Lyrics William Blake)\n11  Florentiner March (Julius Fucik)\n12  Danny Boy (Londonderry Air) (Percy Grainger)\n13  We'll Find a Way (Trevor Jones)\n14  Clog Dance (John Marcangelo)\n15  Colonel Bogey (Kenneth Alford)\n16  All Things Bright and Beautiful (William H Monk/Lyrics Cecil F Alexander)\n17  William Tell Overture (Gioacchino Rossini) Solo Cornet - Shaun Randall\n18  Honest Decent Human Beings (Trevor Jones)\n19  Pomp and Circumstance (Sir Edward Elgar)\n\n\nConducted by Trevor Jones. \nOrchestrations by Trevor Jones and Geoff Alexander. \nPerformed by The Grimethorpe Colliery Band.
