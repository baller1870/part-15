The remaining songs were filmed in a Paris studio, along with additional front projection footage for insertion into the Pompeii performances.[1] The sequences in Paris were filmed in late 1971/early 1972, and can be distinguished by the absence of Rick Wright&amp;#039;s beard. This version was released in theaters in September 1972 and is also included on the DVD edition as an extra feature. In August of 1974, another version was released combining the original film with supposed recording sessions of The Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios. These sessions were actually staged for the film, as the recording of the album had been completed when these sessions were filmed in January of 1973 and the band was mixing the album at the time.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4978a816864886b374eef94aafbf3257d9a181ed","amp;dn":"PINK+FLOYD+%28Live+At+Pompeii%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4978a816864886b374eef94aafbf3257d9a181ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,120,168,22,134,72,134,179,116,238,249,74,175,191,50,87,217,161,129,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
