Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore star as the upper-middle-class couple whose &quot;ordinary&quot; existence is irrevocably shattered by the death of their oldest son in a boating accident. Timothy Hutton is the younger son, struggling against suicide and guilt left by the drowning. Judd Hirsch is the empathetic psychiatrist who provides his lifeline to survival. Mary Tyler Moore gives a riveting portrayal of the inexplicably aloof mother. Robert Redfords achievement as director, after more than twenty years as a superstar in front of the camera, earned him an Oscar.. Superb performances and masterful direction complement the award-winning screenplay, based upon the novel by Judith Guest.\n\n\nOther features:\n\nInteractive Menus, Scene Access, (Trailer deleted)  \n\nDVD9 to Dvd5\nDvd REbuilder + Hc 2pass\n- Overall Bitrate : 4.091Kbs\n- Space for Video : 3.566.040KB\n- HIGH/LOW/TYPICAL Bitrates: 4.178/4.026/4.091 Kbs\n\nVISIT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18f60625634e837a2fde62a98cee3fca32e24ec9","amp;dn":"ORDINARY+PEOPLE+%28Spa+Ger+Fre+Ita%29+Multilanguaje+%2B+Multisubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18f60625634e837a2fde62a98cee3fca32e24ec9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,246,6,37,99,78,131,122,47,222,98,169,140,238,63,202,50,226,78,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
