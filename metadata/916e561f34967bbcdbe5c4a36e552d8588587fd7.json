Their classicist approach to rock &amp; roll earned them both critical praise and derision, as they quickly rocketed to the top of the British charts. \n\n \t\n01 Great Hosannah\t\n02 Mystical Machine Gun\t \t \t\n03 S.O.S.\n04 Radhe Radhe\n05 I'm Still Here\n06 Shower Your Love\n07 108 Battles (Of the Mind)\n08 Sound of Drums\n09 Timeworm\n10 Last Farewell\n11 Golden Avatar\n12 Namami Nanda-Nandana\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:916e561f34967bbcdbe5c4a36e552d8588587fd7","amp;dn":"Kula+Shaker+-+Peasants%2C+Pigs+%26amp%3B+Astronauts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"916e561f34967bbcdbe5c4a36e552d8588587fd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,110,86,31,52,150,123,188,219,229,196,163,110,85,45,133,136,88,127,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
