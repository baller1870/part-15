Who would even think to take on a warhorse like &quot;The Coo Coo Bird&quot; or add electric guitar and drums to &quot;Rain and Snow?&quot; Frazey Ford, Samantha Parton, and Trish Klein sing, play multiple instruments (acoustic and electric), and, now and then, write their own material. They fill out their sound with a number of guests who add bass, drums, and a few other embellishments. Guest Jolie Holland adds her vocals to the breezy opener, &quot;The Littlest Birds,&quot; a song that borrows, and puts to good use, a few lyrics from Syd Barrett's &quot;Jug Band Blues.&quot; A pure country sound washes over &quot;Broken Telephone,&quot; at least until an electric guitar takes a break about mid-way, while a jaunty banjo and mandolin energize &quot;Lakes of Pontchartrain.&quot; Ford and Parton capably handle most of the vocals but what makes these singers special is how their voices mix and mingle in songs like &quot;Up Against the Wall&quot; and on the latter part of &quot;Only in the Past.&quot; The same is true of their instrumental approach. Their motto might be &quot;If it's kind of different and sounds cool, let's see if it will work.&quot; The production isn't neutral. Everything has been brightened a bit, and while this might have been distracting on a traditional album with a traditional approach, it perfectly balances the more experimental approach here. Blue Horse is a lovely debut, full of promise and great tunes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a5a7eaf9e4926c4a18db606cb65f3592dc57cec","amp;dn":"The+Be+Good+Tanyas+-+Blue+Horse+%5B2000%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a5a7eaf9e4926c4a18db606cb65f3592dc57cec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,90,126,175,158,73,38,196,161,141,182,6,203,101,243,89,45,197,124,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
