Steve Lillywhite, the producer synonymous with U2 and five-time Grammy Award winner guided the way and the result is an album that breaks the mold of whatever anyone may think Blue October is.\nLillywhite's first attraction to Blue October was the voice. &quot;For me, it's always the voice that gets me first because my opinion on a voice never changes. There are singers and there are expressionists and Justin is both,&quot; says Steve, who quickly adds that just as important is the artistry, &quot;Their music really touches people in a way that the music of great artists do. There is bond of passion and trust between artist and audience.&quot;\n\n00 blue october approaching normal 2009.jpg\t43.25 KB\n00 blue october approaching normal 2009.m3u\t396.00 B\n00 blue october approaching normal 2009.nfo\t8.78 KB\n00 blue october approaching normal 2009.sfv\t516.00 B\n01 blue october weight of the world.mp3\t5.62 MB\n02 blue october say it.mp3\t5.71 MB\n03 blue october dirt room.mp3\t5.41 MB\n04 blue october been down.mp3\t6.09 MB\n05 blue october my never.mp3\t4.66 MB\n06 blue october should be loved.mp3\t6.58 MB\n07 blue october kangaroo cry.mp3\t7.44 MB\n08 blue october picking up pieces.mp3\t6.18 MB\n09 blue october jump rope.mp3\t4.13 MB\n10 blue october blue skies.mp3\t5.41 MB\n11 blue october blue does.mp3\t4.41 MB\n12 blue october the end (bonus track).mp3\t5.57 MB &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.blueoctober.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.blueoctober.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d70494e82647f1ab4f24fda6f186bc5adb28824d","amp;dn":"Blue_October-Approaching_Normal-2009-MTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d70494e82647f1ab4f24fda6f186bc5adb28824d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,4,148,232,38,71,241,171,79,36,253,166,241,134,188,90,219,40,130,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
