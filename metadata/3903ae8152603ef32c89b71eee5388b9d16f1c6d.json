The LP did, however, allow for some variation from the horn-soul-rock format, and even some of the horn rock reflected more of a Midwestern pop/rock base than BS&amp;T ever did. There was, for instance, the orchestrated smooth harmony pop/rock of &quot;One Woman Man&quot; (their debut single), the MOR Righteous Brothers feel of &quot;Home,&quot; and the quasi-progressive extended arrangements of &quot;Wooden Ships&quot; and &quot;Eleanor Rigby.&quot; Less impressively, &quot;Factory Band&quot; is an obvious imitation of Creedence Clearwater Revival. All of the tracks from the LP have been reissued on the Rhino Handmade compilation Friendly Strangers: The Warner Bros. Recordings, which also has everything from their second and final Warners album (1971's Common Bond) and a few non-LP singles from the period.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3903ae8152603ef32c89b71eee5388b9d16f1c6d","amp;dn":"The+Ides+Of+March+-+Vehicle+%281970%2F2006+US+Psych+Jazz+Funk+%29+Flac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3903ae8152603ef32c89b71eee5388b9d16f1c6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,3,174,129,82,96,62,243,44,137,183,30,238,83,136,185,209,111,28,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
