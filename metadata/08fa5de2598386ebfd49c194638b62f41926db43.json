Let Him Have It\n\n\nThe Bureau were a New Wave soul group formed in late 1980 in Birmingham, England when the original lineup of Dexy&amp;#039;s Midnight Runners split-up.\n\nEx-Dexy&amp;#039;s members Pete Williams (bass), Geoff Blythe (tenor sax), Steve Spooner (alto sax), Stoker (drums), and Mick Talbot (keyboards) were joined by Paul Taylor (trombone), Rob Jones (guitar and trumpet), and Archie Brown (vocals) from a group called The Upset which had supported Dexy&amp;#039;s on tour. The Bureau retained their Dexy&amp;#039;s roots and played powerful brass driven sounds.\n\nThe debut single Only For Sheep was a big hit in Australia, reaching #6[1], but failed to reach the British charts - as did the follow up single Let Him Have It, inspired by the great miscarriage of justice that was the Derek Bentley / Christopher Craig case. An eponymously titled album was released in 1981, but only in Canada and Australia and the band members went their separate ways soon afterwards. The album was finally released in Britain in 2005 and the band reunited to play two launch gigs in London and Birmingham in February that year.
