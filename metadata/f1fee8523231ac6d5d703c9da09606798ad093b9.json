Turns \nout, Danita confesses she's actually married to a handsome affable \ncrime novelist and former Rabbi, Ben Jacobs. Is Danita telling \nRicky the truth when she says wants to leave her husband but fears \nfor her life if she does? Will Ricky go through with the plan to \nkill him so he and Danita can live happily ever after? \n \n[color=red]Screenshots[/color]\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/SQq3l60.png[/img]\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/13OzJIC.png[/img]\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/nnhBCZF.png[/img]\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/OjiJbBf.png[/img]\n\n[color=red][b]Greetz[/b][/color]\n\nTo all ;);)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1fee8523231ac6d5d703c9da09606798ad093b9","amp;dn":"Hit+by+Lightning+2014+WEBrip+XviD+AC3+MiLLENiUM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1fee8523231ac6d5d703c9da09606798ad093b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,254,232,82,50,49,172,109,93,112,60,157,160,150,6,121,138,208,147,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
