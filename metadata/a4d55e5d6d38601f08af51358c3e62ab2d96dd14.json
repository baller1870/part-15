As a singer, King's album Tapestry\ntopped the U.S. album chart for 15 weeks, in 1971, and remained on the charts for\nmore than six years.\n\nShe was most successful as a performer in the first half of the 1970s, although she\nwas a successful songwriter long before and long after that. She had her first #1 hit\nas a songwriter in 1961, at age 18, with &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow,&quot; which she\nwrote with Gerry Goffin. In 1997, she co-wrote &quot;The Reason&quot; for Celine Dion.\n\nIn 2000, Joel Whitburn, a Billboard Magazine pop music researcher, named her the\nmost successful female songwriter of 1955-99, because she wrote or co-wrote 118\npop hits on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nKing has made 25 solo albums, the most successful being Tapestry. Her most recent\nnon-compilation album is Live at the Troubadour, a collaboration with James Taylor,\nwhich reached #4 on the charts, in its first week, and has sold over 400,000 copies.\n\nShe has won four Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of\nFame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for her songwriting. In 2009, Carole King\nwas inducted into the &quot;Hit Parade&quot; Hall of Fame. She holds the record for the longest\ntime for an album by a female to remain on the charts and the longest time for an\nalbum by a female to hold the #1 position, both for Tapestry\n\n\n\n\n   1.
