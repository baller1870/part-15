Liu, Shin-Tson Wu, &quot;Introduction to Flat Panel Displays (Wiley Series in Display Technology)&quot;\nWiley | 2009 | ISBN: 0470516933 | 280 pages | PDF \n\nFlat Panel Displays (FPDs) are a frequent feature in our daily lives, used in mobile phones, laptop computers, desktop computer monitors and TVs. Several display technologies have been developed for FPDs, such as liquid crystal display (LCD), plasma display panel (PDP), light emitting diode (LED), organic light emitting device (OLED) and field emission display (FED).\n\nIntroduction to Flat Panel Displays describes the fundamental sciences behind each display technology: LCD, PDP, LED, OLED and FED including carbon nanotubes. It contains a comparative analysis of the different display technologies in which detailed overviews of each technology are linked together so as to provide a comprehensive reference for students and display engineers, alike. Solved problems as well as homework problems are provided in each chapter to help consolidate studentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ reading, as well as solutions hosted on an accompanying website.\n\nFeatures include:\n\nthe classifications and specifications of display technologies as guidelines for developing a display and judging their performances;\n\nprinciples for designing color displays with good color saturation and wide color gamut;\n\nbasic operating principles of thin-film transistors (TFTs) and their applications to state-of-the-art TFT-LCD and TFT-OLED;\nan overview of FED fundamentals comprising the physics of field emission, as well as FED structure and display mechanism.\n\nSenior undergraduate and graduate students taking courses in engineering, physics and chemistry will benefit from the systematic approach used throughout the book, which will help to prepare students for entry into a display profession. Display engineers, research scientists and technicians working on the development of flat panel display technology will also find this book an invaluable resource. Comparisons of the strengths and weaknesses of each of the display technologies will help professionals to decide which to use for their applications.
