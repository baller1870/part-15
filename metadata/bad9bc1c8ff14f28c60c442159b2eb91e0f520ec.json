(1979-1987)\n\nA representative sample of Dylan's gospel sounds, compiled from the best available sources circa 2006 (Dylan &amp; The Dead has since been remastered).  Volume levels were adjusted for overall consistency.  I believe Dylan's work in this period is generally underrated.  If this compilation helps to alter the popular perception, it will have been worth it.
