As popular tastes changed in the early Seventies, however, he disbanded the Latin Soul Brothers and formed a trio that spent the next 19 years playing standards and what he calls &quot;society Latin&quot; music in the relative obscurity of Catskill Mountain resort hotels-which he might still be doing today if it hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been for a phenomenon that arose from the British club underground known as &quot;acid jazz.&quot;\n\nReturning to New York in 1992 Pucho found that he had been re-discovered by a younger crowd of music fans. The renewed interest in Pucho stemmed from the UK jazz dance scene which championed a cultural mix of sounds including boogaloo, street soul, Latin and Brazilian music.\n\nThis two-on-one is remastered from the original sources.\n\n*Heat! (1968) - This one really gets all the elements right Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from Latin jazz, to boogaloo soul, to some of that funkiness that was creeping into the group's work at the time. The fantastic Pazant Brothers (Eddie &amp; Al) are on sax and trumpet (respectively), and the set also features some vocals by Jackie Soul on a few cuts. Includes some great Latin Jazz tracks like &quot;Heat!&quot; and &quot;Psychedelic Pucho&quot;, plus other great Latin soul cuts, like &quot;Payin' Dues&quot; and &quot;Candied Yam&quot;. \n\n*Jungle Fire! (1969) - The record differs from some of their earlier Prestige albums in that the tracks are longer, more instrumental, and have a hard fuzzy electric groove. The band jams hard in a way that's more like some of the funk combos of the early 70s, than the Latin groups from which they came Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and that's no problem by us, because the results are wonderful! Includes two funky numbers written by Sonny Phillips Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;The Spokerman&quot; and &quot;Jamilah&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ plus a great extended cover of &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;. Great horn work from the funky Pazant Brothers, plus Seldon Powell, who also plays flute and tenor on the album Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and other jazz funk stars on the album include Bernard Purdie, Billy Butler, and Neal Creque, Pucho's right hand man!\n\n\nPUCHO and The Latin Soul Brothers\n\nHeat!            1968\n\nJungle Fire!     1969\n\n\n- CD\n- 1992\n- 320Kbps\n\n\n14 Tracks\nTracks 1 to 9 from Heat!\nTracks 10 to 14 from Jungle Fire!\n\n\n:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd763b6da16440aa82017d1719b06204e3c91cb7","amp;dn":"Pucho+%26amp%3B+The+Latin+Soul+Brothers+-+Heat%21+1968+%26amp%3B+Jungle+Fi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd763b6da16440aa82017d1719b06204e3c91cb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,118,59,109,161,100,64,170,130,1,125,23,25,176,98,4,227,201,28,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
