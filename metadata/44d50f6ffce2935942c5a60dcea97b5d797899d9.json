One day, Bei follows his instincts and trails two-suspicious-looking men into action and foils their plans. The resulting publicity from Bei's heroism brings him to the attention of a private investigator who informs him that he is actually the long-lost son of a wealthy businessman. Hoping to reunite with his true family, Bei travels to Korea where his father lies dying. Bei finds, to his astonishment, that both his parents lived the life he has longed for himself: they were both professional spies. Drawn into a dangerous game of cat and mouse where no one can be trusted, Bei travels to Turkey, where soon it's up to him to track down a new, highly addictive narcotic before it ends up in the hands of evil drug lords.\n- Written by Anita\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0271946/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0271946/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSource--------- HK BD25 AVC\nReleased------- 2013/12/05\nFormat--------- Matroska/h264\nFile size------ 9.4GB\nLength--------- 1:47:36\nVideo Bit rate ~10.8 MBps\nDisplay AR---- 1920/818\nFrame rate---- 23.976 fps\nAudio--------- Chi Cant DTS 5.1 @1500\nSubtitles----- Eng, Ara, Bul, Chs &amp; Cht, Dut, Fin, Gre, Jap, Kor, Pt-br, Rom, Vie\nEncoder------- HighCode","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44d50f6ffce2935942c5a60dcea97b5d797899d9","amp;dn":"+The+Accidental+Spy+2001+Uncut+BDRip+1080p+DTS-HighCode+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44d50f6ffce2935942c5a60dcea97b5d797899d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,213,15,111,252,226,147,89,66,197,166,13,206,169,123,93,121,120,153,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
