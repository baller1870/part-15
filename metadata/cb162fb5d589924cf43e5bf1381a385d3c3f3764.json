And four more cool LPs. If you don&amp;#039;t know some of these bands (except for The Buggles of course), then give them a try. you&amp;#039;ll be in for thrilling music!\n\nMoev - Yeah Whatever [1989]\n\n\nMolding cultured synth-pop and darkwave ambience, the Canadian band Moev first came together in 1981 when Vancouver natives Tom Ferris and Cal Stephenson were seeking a motivated electronic sound. They weren&amp;#039;t concerned with heavy punk elements, and classic rock riffs. The were leaning on the secretive new wave beauty of spiraling guitars and dramatic keyboards. It wasn&amp;#039;t long that vocalist Madeleine Morris and guitarist Mark Jowett joined Moev to make the unit a solid four-piece. Yeah Whatever was released in 1989 and it&amp;#039;s a brilliant LP. \n\n\n\nTracklisting:\n\n01   Yeah Whatever (3:46) \n02   Slide (4:31) \n03   Sentencing (5:27) \n04   Wanting (6:28) \n05   Crucify Me (5:19) \n06   Right Hand (4:15) \n07   Open Mind (5:00) \n08   Capital Heaven (4:50) \n09   Yeah Whatever (12&quot; Version) (5:55) \n10   Crucify Me (12&quot; Version) (5:30) \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSad Lovers &amp; Giants - The Mirror Test [1988]\n\nSad Lovers &amp; Giants are a rock band from Watford, England who formed in 1981. Their sound blends post-punk, folk and psychedelia and has seen them described as &amp;#039;a pastoral Pink Floyd&amp;#039;.\n\nThe band&amp;#039;s members have included Gar?e (vocals), Tristan Garel-Funk (who went on to form The Snake Corps) (guitar), Tony McGuinness (now part of the trance trio Above &amp; Beyond) (Guitar), Cliff Silver (bass), Ian Gibson (bass), David Wood (keyboards and saxophone), Juliet Sainsbury (keyboards) and Nigel Pollard (drums &amp; percussion).\n\nThe original line up produced two albums, Epic Garden Music and Feeding the Flame, but split up in 1984 on the verge of commercial success. They returned in 1987 after a personnel change and released The Mirror Test, Headland and Treehouse \n\nTracklisting:\n\n01 Ours To Kill\n02 White Russians\n03 Take Seven\n04 Seven Kinds of Sin\n05 The Green Years\n06 A Map of My World\n07 The Outsider\n08 Cuckooland\n09 Return To Clocktower Lodge\n10 Wire Lawn\n11 House of Clouds\n12 Summer And Smoke\n13 Life Under Glass\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSilent Running - Shades of Liberty [1984]\n\nThis is a musical gem from Ireland, but undiscovered by many music fans. In the beginning of their career, music press blamed them of being a Simple Minds clone, but that is beside the truth. Though their sound, and the voice of vocalist Peter Gamble has a resemblance with Jim Kerr&amp;#039;s, the band goes further where the Simple Minds stopped. It gives us strong, well-balanced songs, which are brought with power and emotion, without being over the top. All packed in a nice production, this is really a stand-out album of the 80s. Nowadays, their albums are hard to find.  \n\nTracklisting:\n\n01 Home Is Where the Heart Is 3:58 \n02 Emotional Warfare 5:10 \n03 One in a Million Day 3:49 \n04 Sticks and Stones 4:10 \n05 That&amp;#039;s Life 5:48 \n06 Shades of Liberty 4:20 \n07 Crimson Days 3:57 \n08 Young Hearts 3:49 \n09 Go for the Heart 5:50\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nThe Buggles - Adventures in Modern Recording [1981]\n\nAs the answer to the trivia question &quot;What was the first act ever played on MTV?,&quot; the Buggles assured their place in pop music history. Vocalist and bassist Trevor Horn and keyboardist Geoff Downes formed the electro-pop duo in England in 1979 after meeting two years prior as session musicians. Their first single, &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star,&quot; hit number one in the U.K. in late 1979; when MTV went on the air in 1981, the prophetically-titled record&amp;#039;s video was the first ever broadcast on the fledgling cable network.\n\nAlthough the Buggles enjoyed three more British hits ? &quot;The Plastic Age,&quot; &quot;Clean Clean&quot; and &quot;Elstree&quot; ? both Horn and Downes were more interested in production than performing; in 1980, they helmed Yes&amp;#039; Drama, and later joined the group as replacements for Rick Wakeman and Jon Anderson. After Yes&amp;#039; break-up, Downes signed on with Asia, while Horn formed ZTT Records and produced hits for the likes of Frankie Goes to Hollywood and ABC. \n\nTracklisting:\n\n01   Adventures In Modern Recording (3:43) \n02   Beatnik (3:37) \n03   Vermillion Sands (6:47) \n04   I Am A Camera (4:52) \n05   On TV (2:49) \n06   Inner City (3:19) \n07   Lenny (3:13) \n08   Rainbow Warrior (5:23) \n09   Adventures In Modern Recording (Reprise) (0:47) \n10   Fade Away (2:35) \n11   Blue Nylon (2:24) \n12   I Am A Camera (12 Inch Mix) (4:14) \n     \n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb162fb5d589924cf43e5bf1381a385d3c3f3764","amp;dn":"4+Rare+80s+Albums+%5BPart+5%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb162fb5d589924cf43e5bf1381a385d3c3f3764","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,22,47,181,213,137,146,76,244,62,91,241,56,26,56,93,60,63,55,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
