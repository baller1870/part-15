Edit and add jaw-dropping effects with ease. Then share your best with friends, family and the world through the ACDSee Online cloud,Twitter, and e-mail. So simple to use. Yet such amazing results. Take your photos further than you ever dreamed possible with ACDSee 15.\n\nWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s New in ACDSee 15:\n\n- Hierarchical keywords. Organize your collection with hierarchical keywords that help you sort your photos better than ever before. For instance, letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s say you create a keyword tree that looks like this: Events | Local | Birthdays. You can then assign a photo from last weekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s birthday celebration to the Birthdays keyword with the check of a box, and it implicitly gets added to the higher level keywords too. You can create as many levels as you want, and display all of the photos youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve tagged with that keyword in one click. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sorting, supersized!\n- Easily brush on edits. Want to soften only a face and not the entire photo? The Edit Brush makes it super easy and fast to apply any editing effect to a specific part of your photo. Choose your brush size and the amount of feathering to help you achieve exactly the look you want.\n- Blur smartly. Use the Smart Blur filter to blur areas of little or no detail while still maintaining the sharpness and important details of your photo. Try it as a creative effect or to reduce the noise in your photo for a smoother, less grainy look.\n- Improved noise reduction. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t delete those grainy, high ISO photos. Rescue them with ACDSeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s improved noise reduction controls for smoother and more natural results, while saving as much edge detail as possible.\n- Improved red eye. Quickly eliminate pesky red eye, with noticeably better results, thanks to the enhanced red eye reduction tool.\n- Clarity editing tool. Add a little extra definition or add a soft, dreamy effect. The Clarity tool targets the mid-tones of your photos, without affecting the highlights or shadow areas.\n- Burn to Blu-Ray. Quickly and easily archive your images to Blu-Ray discs, directly from within ACDSee.\n- Color management. Photos that are in a color space outside of sRGB are correctly color managed, so what you see on your screen is more true to hue.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nHardware\n-Intel Pentium III / AMD Athlon processor or equivalent (Intel Pentium 4 / AMD Athlon XP or equivalent recommended)\n-512 MB RAM (1 GB RAM recommended)\n-310 MB free hard drive space (1 GB recommended)\n-High Color display adapter at 1024 x 768 resolution (1280 x 1024 recommended)\n-CD/DVD Burner - for creating CDs and DVDs\n\nSoftware\n-Microsoft Windows XP with Service Pack 3, Windows Vista or Windows 7, or Windows 8 operating system.\n-Microsoft Internet Explorer 7+\n-Microsoft DirectX 9.0c\n-Ghostscript 8.0 - for PDF support\n-Windows Media Player 9.0\n\nHomepage: http://www.acdsee.com/\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n1.
