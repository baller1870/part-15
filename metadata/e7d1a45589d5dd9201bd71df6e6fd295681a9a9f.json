Parts of it have been retconned as of Green Lantern v4 29-35 (Secret Origin), but it is still a great read and worth checking out if you are a Hal Jordan fan. I have also included the famous issue of DC Showcase 22 which was the original origin + debut of Hal Jordan, for comparison/nostalgic value/entertainment. It's not a bad read and frankly I prefer DC's older stuff to Marvel more and more. Anywho, these are high quality scans thanks Minutemen-KangCouncil, and though I don't believe they are digital they might as well be to the naked eye. Hoe you enjoy, please seed - thanks! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7d1a45589d5dd9201bd71df6e6fd295681a9a9f","amp;dn":"Green+Lantern+-+Emerald+Dawn+01-06+%2B+Ex+%281989-1990%7CMM-KangCounci","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7d1a45589d5dd9201bd71df6e6fd295681a9a9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,209,164,85,137,213,221,146,1,189,113,223,110,111,210,149,104,26,154,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
