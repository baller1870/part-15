Born into an artistic family, Brasilier has spent more than half a century creating canvasses that are a blend of abstraction, expressionism, and something distinctly his own. His works often feature themes and motifs like horses, nature, music, and women. BrasilierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s art is known around the world, from Japan to the United States. He was recently the subject of an exhibition/retrospective at St. Petersburg, RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s renowned Hermitage Museum.\nAs for nature, Brasiller says, &quot;I remember my first impressions of rural scenes, like oxen pulling a plow&quot;. As for the horse, &quot;I really like this animal, as much for its beauty, as for the harmony that it has with nature. In nature, the horse gives a sense of scale. It provides interesting proportions with the sea and the sky, for example. I love life, and horses, with their forms and their ardour, delight and intrigue me.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d6f3cc4c071bbd90a19c96cf4a9ebaba047f564","amp;dn":"Andre+Brasilier+%281929%29+%28Art+Paintings+nrg%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d6f3cc4c071bbd90a19c96cf4a9ebaba047f564","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,111,60,196,192,113,187,217,10,25,201,108,244,169,235,171,160,71,245,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
