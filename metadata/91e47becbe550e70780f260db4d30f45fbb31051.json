In 1307 King Edward I of England, 'The Hammer of the Scots' and nemesis of William Wallace, died and was replaced by his son, Edward II, who was not from the same mould. Idle and apathetic, he allowed the Scots the chance to recover from the grievous punishment inflicted upon them. By 1314 Bruce had captured every major English-held castle bar Stirling, so finally Edward II took an army north to subdue the Scots.
