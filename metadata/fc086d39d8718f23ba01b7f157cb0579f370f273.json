Profane, cocky, and arrogant, he&amp;#039;s a great fighter pilot -- and he knows it. His boss hates his guts, but knows that if he&amp;#039;s going to straighten out his lagging squadron, Meechum is the man to do it. The story and irony of The Great Santini is in Meechum&amp;#039;s total intolerance of family life and fatherhood. Meechum has a lovely, supportive wife, Lillian (Blythe Danner), an earnest, likeable son, Ben (Michael O&amp;#039;Keefe), three smaller children, and a good home, but Meechum finds the pastoral nature of peacetime totally incompatible with his gung-ho nature. So he begins to drink. He drills his family unmercifully, like recruits. He hammers his son relentlessly until, in a basketball game, his son fights back, and the family cheers Ben&amp;#039;s efforts. Tension builds in the household until, during one drunken night, Meechum breaks down. Based on a best-selling novel by Pat Conroy, The Great Santini earned critical raves but fared poorly at the box office. Duvall&amp;#039;s performance as Meechum is generally regarded as one of his greatest.\n\n\nBurn Tested!\n\n\nTiTLE......[ The Great Santini\nGENRE......[ Drama\nRUNTiME....[ 1:55:23\nAUDiO......[ MP3 \nLANGUAGE...[ English\nViDEO......[ XviD  \nDiMENSiONS.[ 512 x 384\nSUBS.......[ None \nFiLES......[ 4 \nSiZE.......[ 700 MB\nSOURCE.....[ DVD\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc086d39d8718f23ba01b7f157cb0579f370f273","amp;dn":"The.Great.Santini.%5BRobert.Duvall%5D.1979.DvDRip.XviD.MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc086d39d8718f23ba01b7f157cb0579f370f273","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,8,109,57,216,113,143,35,186,1,183,241,87,203,5,121,243,112,242,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
