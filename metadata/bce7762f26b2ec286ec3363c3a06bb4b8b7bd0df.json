Alan Jay Lerner was an early collaborator, but withdrew due to illness after some initial work on a single song, &quot;Masquerade&quot;.[2][3] The central plot revolves around a beautiful soprano, Christine DaaÃƒÂ©, who becomes the obsession of a mysterious, disfigured musical genius.\n\nThe Phantom of the Opera opened in the West End in 1986, celebrating its 25th anniversary in October 2011; and on Broadway in 1988. It won the 1986 Olivier Award and the 1988 Tony Award for Best Musical, and Michael Crawford (in the title role) won the 1986 Olivier and 1988 Tony for Best Performance by an Actor in a Musical. It is the longest-running Broadway show by a wide margin, the second longest-running West End musical, and the third longest-running West End show overall.\n\nWith total worldwide box office receipts of over $5.1 billion (Ã‚Â£3.5 billion), including a Broadway gross of US $800 million, Phantom is the highest-grossing entertainment event of all time and the most financially successful theatrical show in history. It had been seen by over 130 million people in 145 cities in 27 countries by 2011, the most successful entertainment project in history.]\n\n\nPhantom of the Opera (Original Cast Recording)\n\n01 - Prologue\n02 - Overture\n03 - Think of Me\n04 - Angel of Music\n05 - Little Lotte-The Mirror-Angel of Music\n06 - The Phantom of the Opera\n07 - The Music of the Night\n08 - I Remember-Stranger Than You Dreamt it\n09 - Magical Lasso\n10 - Notes-Prima Donna\n11 - Poor Fool-He Makes Me Laugh\n12 - Why Have You Brought Me Here\n13 - All I Ask Of You\n14 - All I Ask Of You (Reprise)\n15 - Entr'acte\n16 - Masquerade-Why So Silent\n17 - Notes...-Twisted Every Way...\n18 - Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\n19 - Wandering Child...-Bravo, Monsieur\n20 - The Point Of No Return\n21 - Down Once More...-Track Down This Murderer...\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bce7762f26b2ec286ec3363c3a06bb4b8b7bd0df","amp;dn":"The+Phantom+of+the+Opera+%28The+Original+London+Cast%29+%5B320+CBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bce7762f26b2ec286ec3363c3a06bb4b8b7bd0df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,231,118,47,38,178,236,40,110,195,54,60,58,6,187,75,139,123,208,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
