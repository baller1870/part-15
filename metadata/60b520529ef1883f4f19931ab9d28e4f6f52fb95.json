In this way, and much to the horror of Leftist doomsayers, capitalism is not just going to break on its own.\n\nAnother interesting thing he mentions in passing is how human waste has become so integrated into the functioning of the ecosystem that (as some ecologists suggest?) an imaginary, sudden removal of all human pollution could ITSELF be an ecological catastrophe. Something to think about for anti-capitalists, environmentalists and philosophers alike.\n\nEnjoy! \n\nFile format: MPEG\n\nSee also:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4386316/Slavoj_Zizek_-_Interview_-_On_Violence&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4386316/Slavoj_Zizek_-_Interview_-_On_Violence&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4386455&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4386455&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60b520529ef1883f4f19931ab9d28e4f6f52fb95","amp;dn":"Slavoj+Zizek+-+Lecture+-+Ecology+Without+Nature","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60b520529ef1883f4f19931ab9d28e4f6f52fb95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,181,32,82,158,241,136,63,79,25,147,26,185,210,142,79,111,82,251,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
