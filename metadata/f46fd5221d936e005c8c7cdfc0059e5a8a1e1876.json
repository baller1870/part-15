What guides the migration of birds, whales, and fish across the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s oceans? How is Earth able to sustain life under an onslaught of solar wind and cosmic radiation? For centuries, the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great scientists have grappled with these questions, all rooted in the same phenomenonÃ¢â‚¬â€EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s magnetism.\nOver 2,000 years after the invention of the compass, Einstein called the source of EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s magnetic field one of greatest unsolved mysteries of physics. Here, for the first time, is the complete history of the quest to understand EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s magnetismÃ¢â‚¬â€from the ancient GreeksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fascination with lodestone, to the geological discovery that the North Pole has not always been in the NorthÃ¢â‚¬â€and to the astonishing modern conclusions that finally revealed the true source.\nRichly illustrated and skillfully told, North Pole, South Pole unfolds the human story behind the science: that of the inquisitive, persevering, and often dissenting thinkers who unlocked the secrets at our planetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s core.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f46fd5221d936e005c8c7cdfc0059e5a8a1e1876","amp;dn":"North+Pole%2C+South+Pole%3A+Quest+to+Solve+Earth%27s+Magnetism","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f46fd5221d936e005c8c7cdfc0059e5a8a1e1876","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,111,213,34,29,147,110,0,92,140,124,223,192,5,158,90,138,30,24,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
