Drug Design of Zinc-Enzyme Inhibitors brings together functional and structural information relevant to these zinc-containing targets. With up-to-date overviews of the latest developments field, this unique and comprehensive text enables readers to understand zinc enzymes and evaluate them in a drug design context.\n\nWith contributions from the leaders of today's research, Drug Design of Zinc-Enzyme Inhibitors covers such key topics as:\n\n    *\n\n      Major drug targets like carbonic anhydrases, matrix metalloproteinases, bacterial proteases, angiotensin-converting enzyme, histone deacetylase, and APOBEC3G\n    *\n\n      Roles of recently discovered zinc-containing isozymes in cancer, obesity, epilepsy, pain management, malaria, and other conditions\n    *\n\n      Cross reactivity of zinc-enzyme inhibitors and activators\n    *\n\n      The extensive use of X-ray crystallography and QSAR studies for understanding zinc-containing proteins\n    *\n\n      Clinical applications\n\nAn essential resource for the discovery and development of new drug molecules, Drug Design of Zinc-Enzyme Inhibitors gives researchers, professionals, students, and academics the foundation to understand and work with zinc enzyme inhibitors and activators.\n\n\n\n# Hardcover: 1038 pages\n# Publisher: Wiley; 1 edition (August 17, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0470275006\n# ISBN-13: 978-0470275009","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2920d6f075ca11b9f01574da171baa9dbdda14de","amp;dn":"Drug+Design+of+Zinc-Enzyme+Inhibitors+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2920d6f075ca11b9f01574da171baa9dbdda14de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,32,214,240,117,202,17,185,240,21,116,218,23,27,170,157,189,218,20,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
