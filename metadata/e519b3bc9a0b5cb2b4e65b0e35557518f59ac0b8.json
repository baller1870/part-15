Different governments, different worlds, different problems. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s where the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne (Terran Diplomatic Corps) help out. The humans of EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worlds have always tried to smooth out the rough spots of diplomacy with its neighbors, but sometimes you have to do more than talk. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s where Jaime Retief gets called in. His hands-on style of diplomacy gets answers and results, no matter what world heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sent to or who he has to work with.\n\nDenis Fujitake and Jan Strnad have taken (John) Keith LaumerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interstellar diplomatic troubleshooter and portrayed him in their own unique manner. Very faithful to the original stories and a very honest portrayal of LaumerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trouble-shooting diplomat.\n\nPlease Seed and Enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e519b3bc9a0b5cb2b4e65b0e35557518f59ac0b8","amp;dn":"Keith+Laumer%27s+Retief+%28Mad+Dog+-+1987%29+%28Rumor-Novus-HD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e519b3bc9a0b5cb2b4e65b0e35557518f59ac0b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,25,179,188,154,11,92,178,180,230,91,14,53,85,117,24,245,154,192,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
