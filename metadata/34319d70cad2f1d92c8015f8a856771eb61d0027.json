The two-CD set, The Midnight Mover: The Bobby Womack Collection, only covers the middle chapters of that story, but those years (1968-76) brought the singer-guitarist-songwriter-producer his only Top 40 pop hits: &quot;That's the Way I Feel About Cha,&quot; &quot;Harry Hippie,&quot; &quot;Nobody Wants You When You're Down and Out,&quot; and &quot;Lookin' for a Love.&quot; Womack is better known today for songs that were recorded by others: &quot;It's All Over Now&quot; by the Rolling Stones, &quot;Woman's Gotta Have It&quot; by the Neville Brothers, &quot;I'm in Love&quot; by Aretha Franklin, and 17 different songs by Wilson Pickett, most notably &quot;I'm a Midnight Mover.&quot; All these recordings are superior to Womack's own versions (he is a robust gospel-soul singer but curiously lacking in understatement or big climaxes), but they are indicative of Womack's knack for telling a story to a very funky beat. All 8 of the above songs are included among the 44 tracks on the new anthology. What's missing from this anthology are the early chapters in Womack's story and the later chapters (his brilliant post-cocaine comeback albums, 1981's The Poet and 1984's The Poet II, his collaborations with Patti LaBelle and Wilton Felder, and his 1986 reunion with Moman, Womagic, the best album of his career). The Midnight Mover is the kind of anthology you shouldn't bother with until you have Otis Redding, Al Green, Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, Curtis Mayfield, and Aretha Franklin covered. But if you have plenty of their recordings and still hunger for more classic R&amp;B, Bobby Womack is a good next move.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nThe Pointer Sisters (Background vocals) , \nBill Withers (Background vocals), \nBobby Womack (Guitar, percussion, vocals),\nHerbie Hancock (Keyboards), \nChuck Rainey (Bass), \nPete Carr (Guitar), \nBill Summers (Percussion), \nJohn Blair (Strings), \nPeace (Horn), \nDavid Foster (Keyboards), \nJim Keltner (Drums), \nRoger Dollarhide (Keyboards), \nSneaky Pete Kleinow (Guitar), \nTippy Armstrong (Guitar), \nBobby Babies (Background vocals),\nBarry Beckett (Keyboards), \nHayword Bishop (Percussion,drums), \nBill Braun (Percussion, drums), \nHarrison Calloway (Horn),  \nGene Chrisman (Drums), \nLackie Clark (Guitar), \nTommy Cogbill (Bass), \nCosme Daeguero (Percussion), \nRonnie Eades (Horn), \nBobby Emmons (Keyboards), \nCharles Fullilve (Guitar), \nJames Gadson (Drums), \nGlen Goins (Guitar), \nPam Grier (Background vocals),\nRene Hall (Strings), \nPatrice Holloway (Background vocals), \nRoger Hawkins (Percussion, drums), \nDavid Hood (Bass), \nClayton Ivey (Keyboards), \nJimmy Johnson (Guitar), \nLouis Johnson (Bass), \nKen Khristian (Guitar), \nJoe Lala (Percussion), \nLinda Lawrence (Background vocals),\nMike Leech (Bass), \nBill Lordan (Drums), \nDale Quillen (Horn), \nLarry &quot;Rhino&quot; Rheinhart (Guitar), \nSoko Richardson (Drums), \nRobert Robertie (Drums), \nJulia Tillman Waters (Background vocals),\nRon Selico (Drums), \nJanice Singleton (Background vocals),\nPaul Stallworth (Bass), \nIvory Stone (Background vocals),\nSundry (Background vocals), \nTruman Thomas (Keyboards), \nHarvey Thompson (Horn), \nThe Valentinos (Background vocals),\nWah Wah Watson (Guitar), \nWillie Weeks (Bass), \nGregory White (Background vocals),\nLorna Willard (Background vocals),\nBobby Woods (Keyboards), \nReggie Young (Guitar), \nLarry Zack (Drums), \nWilliam D. &quot;Smitty&quot; Smith (Keyboards), \nLeon Ware (Keyboards), Sonny Burke (Drums), \nSonny Burke (Keyboards), \nJulia Tilman (Background vocals),\nCharles Fullilove (Guitar), \nSundray (Background vocals),\nCarmichael Singers (Background vocals),\nDavid Turner (Guitar).\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n\nCD One\n\n01.
