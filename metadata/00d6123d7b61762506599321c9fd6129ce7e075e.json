Their meaning is just trying to spread \nconfusion and to frustrate TPB and it\\\\\\'s users. \nLess downloaders = less seeders = less download speed etc = not good! \n\nIt\\\\\\'s in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intentionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It\\\\\\'s an easy answer against \nthose who intentionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That\\\\\\'s for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet\\\\\\'s just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what\\\\\\'s said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the \\\\\\&quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users\\\\\\&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00d6123d7b61762506599321c9fd6129ce7e075e","amp;dn":"Publicspace.net.A.Better.Finder.Attributes.v5.10.MacOSX.Incl.Key","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00d6123d7b61762506599321c9fd6129ce7e075e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,214,18,61,123,97,118,37,6,89,147,33,201,253,97,41,206,126,7,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
