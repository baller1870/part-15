In alliance with The United American Committee the Truth in  Education Subcommittee has researched and written the following Special Report. \n\nThe goal of this Special Report is to awaken educators, publishers, parents, the \nmedia and American citizens to the systematic deception about Islam that is being taught  to our junior high school students. However, blatant Islamist propaganda is also a serious  problem in our high schools, colleges and universities.\n\nThis Report also exposes the organizations and individuals who are behind these \ndeliberately false accounts of the true history, nature, and ambition of Islam. It concludes  with some preliminary recommendations on how to stop Islamic propaganda in AmericaÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs  schools. \n\nThe authors believe it is crucial, for the protection of all AmericansÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ security, \nliberty and values, to guarantee the factual accuracy of our childrenÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs educationÃ¢â‚¬â€\nespecially about Islam. \n\n\nPresented by\n\nACT! for America, Mission Viejo Chapter &amp; the United American Committee\nTruth in Education Joint Subcommittee\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.actforamerica92691.org/1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.actforamerica92691.org/1.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6b040e16cd0ffed274fe9276353673ebf19557e","amp;dn":"Islam+in+America%26rsquo%3Bs+Classrooms+History+or+Propaganda.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6b040e16cd0ffed274fe9276353673ebf19557e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,176,64,225,108,208,255,237,39,79,233,39,99,83,103,62,191,25,85,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
