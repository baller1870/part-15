To me being a      :\n : wiseguy was better than being president of the United States. To be a      :\n : wiseguy was to own the world.' GoodFellas is Henry Hill's own story,       :\n : telling the fascinating and sometimes brutal details of the day-to-day life:\n : of a working New York mobster - the violence, wild spending sprees, his    :\n : wife, his mistress, his code of honour. From the small-time scamming of his:\n : early years, his first arrest at the age of sixteen and initiation into the:\n : dealings of his wiseguy friends and bosses, Henry Hill tells of the good   :\n : times, dodgy dealings, indulgences, and the insularity of the              :\n : mob-controlled neighbourhoods. But things start to go too far. To save his :\n : own life, Hill turns into a Federal witness, and the mob is to this day    :\n : still hunting him down for revealing their involvement in hundreds of      :\n : crimes including arson, extortion, hijacking, the six-million dollar       :\n : Lufthansa heist (the most successful cash robbery in US history), and      :\n : murder.                                                                    :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5e06b31792a3bac1beeccf695922c19fba7a5f5","amp;dn":"Nicholas+Pileggi+GoodFellas+2011+Retail+EPUB+eBook-BitBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5e06b31792a3bac1beeccf695922c19fba7a5f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,224,107,49,121,42,59,172,27,238,204,246,149,146,44,25,251,167,165,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
