Yeah. I said it.\n\nThe series ran for six issues and was comprised of British reprints, featuring early work from Steve Moore, aka &quot;Pedro Henry&quot;, Steve Dillon, Dave Gibbons and Brian Bolland. A later series entitled &quot;Laser Eraser and Pressbutton&quot; - previously uploaded - continued the adventures.\n\nA great deal of love to the creators and scanners! Please do get it, please do seed it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b6d03d8b1d34fd6fd0f6c354ad63fa77d138f1f","amp;dn":"Axel+Pressbutton+%28Eclipse+fill%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b6d03d8b1d34fd6fd0f6c354ad63fa77d138f1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,109,3,216,177,211,79,214,253,15,108,53,74,214,63,167,125,19,143,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
