Foo Fighters continue to redefine the parameters of the post-grunge rock world with their fifth album, IN YOUR HONOR. Dave Grohl and company flesh out their impressive canon with a two-CD set--the first disc plugged-in and packed with screaming guitars and vocals, while the second disc showcases the band's more acoustic and ethereal side. The loud-soft-loud dynamic approach of Grohl's former band for resonates quite a bit through Disc One. &quot;Free Me&quot; turns the distortion down briefly before pile-driver rhythms and Grohl's relentless guitar riffs dovetail smoothly into quirky-yet-effective time changes. Reflecting the personal tumult of recent years are the anthemic &quot;Resolve&quot; and the indignant kiss-off &quot;The Last Song,&quot; with its AC/DC-flavored attitude and stomping cadence. Disc Two's mellower offerings are no less intriguing, showing the band's stylistic range.  &quot;Another Round,&quot; with its mix of harmonium, harp, and mandolin could easily be mistaken for a Counting Crows outtake, and the dueling acoustic guitars on &quot;Razor&quot; are more Leo Kottke than Kyuss.
