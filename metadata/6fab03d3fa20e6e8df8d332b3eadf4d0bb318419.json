The sixteen tracks of Cavalier Faidit revolve around the theme of rebellion, which was developed based on the figure of the knight conscript or one of those Occitan brave soldiers who rebelled against the French invasion, which thus becomes a metaphor and a symbol for all those who today oppose the injustices.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fab03d3fa20e6e8df8d332b3eadf4d0bb318419","amp;dn":"Lou+Dalfin++-+Cavalier+Faidit+%5Bmp3+320+kbps%5D%5BTNTvillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fab03d3fa20e6e8df8d332b3eadf4d0bb318419","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,171,3,211,250,32,230,232,223,141,51,43,62,173,244,208,187,49,132,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
