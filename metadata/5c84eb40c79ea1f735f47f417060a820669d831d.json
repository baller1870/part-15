Earth's defenders never surrender!\n\nThese are HQ x264 rips from the Power Rangers Legacy Collection DVDs.\n\n \nPower Rangers in Space (often abbreviated as &quot;PRIS&quot; or referred to as &quot;In Space&quot;) was a television show, the sixth season of Power Rangers. It was the first full season of Power Rangers to be handled by show runners Judd Lynn and Jonathan Tzachor.\n\nIt was loosely based on, and involved footage from, the Japanese television show Denji Sentai Megaranger (or Electromagnetic Task Force MegaRanger), the twenty-first Super Sentai series. The show was a turning point in the history of the Power Rangers franchise, as the season brought about the end of six years worth of storylines and was the ending of the practice of having the Power Rangers be a continuous serial-style show with a regular cast that carried over from one season to the next. It was supposedly going to be the last season, but due to major ratings, they succeeded and went on to making a new season","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c84eb40c79ea1f735f47f417060a820669d831d","amp;dn":"Power+Rangers+in+Space+%28Legacy+Collection+and+Beyond%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c84eb40c79ea1f735f47f417060a820669d831d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,132,235,64,199,158,161,247,53,244,127,65,112,96,168,32,102,157,131,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
