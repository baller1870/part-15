The only news to come out so far is &quot;apparent suicide&quot;, with no other details. So everyone is saying how sad suicide is but no one is asking if he really did kill himself. We have to consider that he may have been suicided; he might have been killed and it made to look like a suicide. This kid was only 19 years old and was rapping prolifically about all kinds of enlightened shit. All kinds of truth. And for him to have such a successful entry into the game, such a promising young talent sure to gain influence over the minds of youth all over the country - STEEZ was a threat to the establishment's mind control over the people. So just like Pac, MLK, JFK and 9/11, the truth will never be fully revealed to the sleeping public. R.I.P. STEEZ: young Prophet.\n\nFYI: Steez dropped this video &quot;Free The Robots&quot; back on September 11th. I don't know how I slept on it but I did. It happens. \nAlso, there is an eerie reference to suicide on Fowl's video &quot;2012 Blues&quot; (the one right before STEEZ). The real crazy thing is I had no idea that part was in there, I swear. I hadn't watched the whole video yet, I just knew it was a good song by a good new lyricist and the title &quot;2012 Blues&quot; seemed appropriate to go before STEEZ. And Blu closes out the mix properly, dedicating the song and video to STEEZ aka Jamal Dewar. \n\nMake sure to give your loved ones flowers while they can still smell them.\n\nPeace\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb79d91811a43df795b34aa94bf22b1851ba1e79","amp;dn":"Blazin%27+Hot+Hip-Hop+Music+Videos+January+2013+NTSC+DVDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb79d91811a43df795b34aa94bf22b1851ba1e79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,121,217,24,17,164,61,247,149,179,74,169,75,242,43,24,81,186,30,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
