Funding and creative disputes left him with little say over the final cut of the theatrical release of the film, and the fact that this edit was created by a team of businessmen and not an artist is apparent in every frame. \n\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a score of 0.5 stars (out of four), saying: &quot;Highlander II: The Quickening is the most hilariously incomprehensible movie I've seen in many a long dayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a movie almost awesome in its badness. Wherever science fiction fans gather, in decades and generations to come, this film will be remembered in hushed tones as one of the immortal low points of the genre.&quot;\n\nAnd so, it is with much love and care that I have created this file, ripped directly from the French TFI Video DVD. Anyone who is familiar primarily with the later versions will notice the differences IMMEDIATELY. From the sequence of events to the subplot of the Immortals actually being an alien race from the planet Zeist, this version is completely different.\n\nEveryone involved in this production wants this version of the film to go away, and I'm here to make sure that it does not! \n\nVIDEO:\nSize:\t\t\t720x576 Pixels\nBitrate:\t        1200 kbps\nFrame Rate: \t\t25 frames/second\nVideo Compression:\tH.264/AVC\nDuration: \t\t1:25:58.440\n\nAUDIO:\nBitrate:        192 kbps\nChannels:\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t44100 Hz\nAudio Format:\tMP3\nDuration: \t1:25:58.440\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2acd25e844349295543fdfd62763d145073ebf1b","amp;dn":"Highlander+II%3A+The+Quickening+-+THEATRICAL+version","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2acd25e844349295543fdfd62763d145073ebf1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,205,37,232,68,52,146,149,84,63,223,214,39,99,209,69,7,62,191,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
