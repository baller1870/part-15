Whoever did this, Lucas Davenport knows, is pushed by brain chemistry. There is something wrong with him. This isnt a bad love affair.The second body is found three weeks later, in a farmhouse six miles south. Same condition, same display except this time it is a man. Nothing to link the two victims, nothing to indicate that the killings end here.\r\n\r\nThis guy Lucas said. He took a deep breath, let it out as a sigh. this guy is going to bust our chops.\r\n\r\nAnd soon he is going to do far, far worse than that","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:624244bba5476d1666861c695ef05a5c47aba50a","amp;dn":"John+Sandford-Broken+Prey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"624244bba5476d1666861c695ef05a5c47aba50a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,66,68,187,165,71,109,22,102,134,28,105,94,240,90,92,71,171,165,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
