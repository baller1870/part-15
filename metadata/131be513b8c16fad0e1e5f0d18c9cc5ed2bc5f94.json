With all respect to Kurt Cobain I can here in my voice and kinda figured that I was doing a David Bowie version of Andy Warhol doing Kurt Cobain. I remember when River Phoenix died and thought the world had darkened a little without him. And when Kurt died it hurt even. There are so few that bring so much into this world and it is a shame to lose them so young. I used to go up to Pike Street in Seattle in the 80's and 90's. I have never followed the inner squab lings surrounding Kurt's death. I think Courtney Love's lyrics are brilliant. And when I discovered the Foo Fighters I was so happy. I feel like David Grohl not just that he keeps Nirvana's spirit alive...but that he keeps his own alive. In so many that don't survive it is comforting to see those who do.\n\nI resolved my problems with the net. I am piggy backing on a public internet and so I cannot open Router Ports. But it seemed to resolve when I installed Mcafee from Zonealarm.\n\nPlease give me some room for criticism. I have not sung for years and forgot that I could. I am just trying slowly to remember. As a child I have very few memories. I used to sing into my mothers stereo speaker when I was 12. I realized years later the reason I did that is I am hard of hearing. It was when Vista came out that I realized that I could loop my mic back in through my speakers and hear my voice match on my headphones. Otherwise I am lost. I hope this doesn't suk too much","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:131be513b8c16fad0e1e5f0d18c9cc5ed2bc5f94","amp;dn":"Man+Who+Sold+the+World.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"131be513b8c16fad0e1e5f0d18c9cc5ed2bc5f94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,27,229,19,184,193,111,173,14,30,95,13,24,201,204,94,210,188,95,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
