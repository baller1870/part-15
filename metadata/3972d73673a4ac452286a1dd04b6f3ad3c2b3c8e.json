But even slow-tempo tracks never lapse into Sanborn-fuzak, nicely fitting space in between the energetic funky tracks, which prevail here. Only one track, the utterly commercial pop ballad &quot;I'll Still Be Looking Up To You&quot; breaks the album's flow, but since it's track 13, you'll probably be so excited by that time, that you won't pay attention. The arrangements are great, especially when it comes to combining live and computer-generated sounds. \nThe unforgettable journey, and the best choice to start with, if you are unfamiliar with Candy's music.
