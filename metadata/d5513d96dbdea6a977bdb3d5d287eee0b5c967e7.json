The answer is at precisely 11:58:43 p.m.\r\nTo understand what latecomers we are, we must know the time at which life actually began on it. It's at 4 a.m. At 10:56 p.m, the mighty dinosaurs who ruled the Earth for centuries arrived. Then, at 11:58:43 p.m, the most intelligent animals ever, the human beings appeared.\r\nThe Earth is the only planet with life on it.
