Rejected by every major record label, Meat knew the raw\nemotional power him and his partner Jim Steinman had created would hit where it counted - with\nthe fans and the amazing public response proved them right. But the personal demons that powered\nhis meteoric rise almost destroyed him until, over a decade later, he roared back to fame with\none of the biggest selling rock albums of all time.\nFrom car hop to stadium star and big time to bankrupt and back, it&amp;#039;s a tale that some would say \nis over the top. But like the man said if you don&amp;#039;t go over the top, you&amp;#039;ll never see what&amp;#039;s\non the other side.\n\nMEAT LOAF - TO HELL AND BACK\n\nDURATION: 1:28:13\nCODEC: XVID\nBIT RATE: 128 KBPS\nDIMENSIONS: 640 x 480\nSIZE: 846MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64ecf4ec49dadefda04b9559c331605e342b6ec3","amp;dn":"Meat+Loaf+-+To+Hell+And+Back+2000+VHS+RiP+XviD.+DOC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64ecf4ec49dadefda04b9559c331605e342b6ec3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,236,244,236,73,218,222,253,160,75,149,89,195,49,96,94,52,43,110,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
