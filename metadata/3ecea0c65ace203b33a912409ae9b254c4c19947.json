Anti-Catholics sometimes charge that the Bible and the Mass are somehow in competition with one another, but that's just not so. When we go deep in the history of God's people, we learn that the Bible is for the liturgy, and the liturgy is for the Bible. We learn, too, that the Bible is about the liturgy, and the liturgy is about the Bible. Dr. Scott Hahn joins Mike Aquilina to take on the lofty subject of the biblical roots of Catholic rites and the ritual roots of the Bible. He shows how scriptural texts have been intimately tied to ritual public worship since the early Christian church and even before that in the Jewish temple. \n\nThe series is based on Dr. Hahn's book, &quot;Letter and Spirit: From Written Text to Living Word in the Liturgy&quot;, which is included in a ZIP file in EPUB/MOBI/OPF/PDF formats.\n\n\n13 MP3 files totaling nearly 6.5 hours\n\n\nPART 1, THE LITURGY IN THE BIBLE, THE BIBLE IN THE LITURGY - Dr. Scott Hahn and Mike Aquilina examine the relationship between the Bible and Catholic Liturgy.\n\nPART 2, THE GENESIS OF LITURGY - The roots of Catholic Liturgy back to the most ancient times recorded in the Bible\n\nPART 3, CANON AND COVENANT - Exploring the canons, councils, and covenants that bind the books of the Bible into a single inspired volume.\n\nPART 4, IT'S THE ECONOMY - The history and meaning of the Christian economy\n\nPART 5, THE PRIESTLY PEOPLE OF EXODUS - The life of Moses and the priestly people of the Book of Exodus.\n\nPART 6, THE PRIESTLY KINGDOM OF DAVID - The great accomplishment of DavidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dynasty: the building of the new temple filled with songs of thanksgiving and praise.\n\nPART 7, THE JEWISH ROOTS OF CATHOLIC RITES - Dr. Scott Hahn and Mike Aquilina look at the Jewish roots of Christian rites.\n\nPART 8, THE GOSPEL TRUTH ABOUT RITUAL - Why the Catholic Church has so many rituals and traditions. \n\nPART 9, THE APOCALYPTIC JOURNEY: HEBREWS AND REVELATION - How the Book of Revelation and the Letter to the Hebrews present an apocalyptic liturgy.\n\nPART 10, THE BIBLE DAY BY DAY - Dr. Scott Hahn and Mike Aquilina discuss the lectionary as a form of daily Biblical reading. \n\nPART 11, THE MEMORY OF THE CHURCH AND THE MEANING OF TRADITION - How Sacred Tradition is the memory of the Church.\n\nPART 12, THE MASS: WHERE THE CHURCH TEACHES - Dr. Scott Hahn and Mike Aquilina show why the Mass is the ChurchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most effective teaching tool.\n\nPART 13, SACRIFICE IN THE NEW COVENANT - The meaning of the New Covenant Sacrifice of Christ. \n\n\nMore: https://thepiratebay.se/user/ancapcatholic \n\nBTC: 1N3Y2HNWe3xWY4qdYricHRKz58zqqi5MZp","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ecea0c65ace203b33a912409ae9b254c4c19947","amp;dn":"Dr.+Scott+Hahn+-+Letter+and+Spirit+%2813-part+audio+series+%2B+book%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ecea0c65ace203b33a912409ae9b254c4c19947","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,206,160,198,90,206,32,59,51,169,18,64,154,233,178,84,196,193,153,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
