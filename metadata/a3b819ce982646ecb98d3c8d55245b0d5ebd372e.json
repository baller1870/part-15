But the full repercussions of China's ascendancy-for itself and the rest of the globe-have been surprisingly little explained or understood. In this far-reaching and original investigation, Martin Jacques offers provocative answers to some of the most pressing questions about China's growing place on the world stage.\n\nMartin Jacques reveals, by elaborating on three historical truths, how China will seek to shape the world in its own image. The Chinese have a rich and long history as a civilization-state. Under the tributary system, outlying states paid tribute to the Middle Kingdom. Ninety-four percent of the population still believes they are one race-&quot;Han Chinese.&quot; The strong sense of superiority rooted in China's history promises to resurface in twenty-first century China and in the process strengthen and further unify the country.\n\nA culturally self-confident Asian giant with a billion-plus population, China will likely resist globalization as we know it. This exceptionalism will have powerful ramifications for the rest of the world and the United States in particular. As China is already emerging as the new center of the East Asian economy, the mantle of economic and, therefore, cultural relevance will in our lifetimes begin to pass from Manhattan and Paris to cities like Beijing and Shanghai. It is the American relationship with and attitude toward China, Jacques argues, that will determine whether the twenty-first century will be relatively peaceful or fraught with tension, instability, and danger.\n\nWhen China Rules the World is the first book to fully conceive of and explain the upheaval that China's ascendance will cause and the realigned global power structure it will create.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 576 pages\n# Publisher: Penguin Press HC, The; Second Edition edition (November 12, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1594201854\n# ISBN-13: 978-1594201851","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3b819ce982646ecb98d3c8d55245b0d5ebd372e","amp;dn":"When+China+Rules+the+World+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3b819ce982646ecb98d3c8d55245b0d5ebd372e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,184,25,206,152,38,70,236,185,141,60,141,85,36,91,13,94,189,55,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
