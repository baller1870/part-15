The album features &quot;Love is Like Oxygen&quot;, the band's last original single to hit the top 40 on both sides of the Atlantic, peaking at #8 in the United States and #9 in the UK Singles Chart. The single version of &quot;Love is Like Oxygen&quot; is substantially shorter than the full album version, and the US version having only the first verse, shorter intermezzo and the funky outro. A second single, &quot;California Nights&quot;, was released from the album but only reached #78 in the UK and #76 in the US.\n\nThis was the last album to feature the &quot;classic&quot; Sweet line-up of Brian Connolly, Andy Scott, Mick Tucker and Steve Priest. About a year after its release, while working on the next album, Connolly left the band to embark on a solo career. The remaining trio continued as Sweet and delivered three more albums before breaking up in 1982.\n(video has a 5 semi-transparent blue dots at the bottom right)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_Headed&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_Headed&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/pahgGAADM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/pahgGAADM&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 8000kbps\n   Audio: PCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Duration: 00:03:38\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
