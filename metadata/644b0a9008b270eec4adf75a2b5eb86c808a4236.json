The withdrawal was \npart of the agreement when it was filmed. I would imagine Eurostar dont want \ntheir trains to be associated with commuter lines and DC power. The CTRL is \nmuch higher profile.&quot;\n\n&quot;Service 9025 departs Gare du Nord over the classic main line through the \nNorthern suburbs of Paris. Then the pantograph tension is increased and we \nenter the LGV Nord (Ligne a Grande Vitesse Nord). Travelling at top speed for \nover half an hour on this purpose built line, encountering gradients as steep \nas 1 in 40, the TVM 430 in-cab signalling system gradually reduces the speed \nfor our one intermediate stop - at Lille Europe.\n\nThe next major feature is the Channel Tunnel itself. Here, our train is \nfollowed both in the cab and from the Euro Tunnel control centre at Folkestone.\nEmerging from the tunnel, we then travel over Britain's first high speed \nline - the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL1). After flying over Ashford \nInternational station and the River Medway, our complex train slows again for \nthe changeover to Network Rail and the former Southern Region's third rail \nwhich will take us through the suburbs of South London and into Waterloo \nInternational.&quot;\n\nThanks to anotheruser from TheBox, who uploaded the ISO-File. Since I think,\nthat many of you folks still don't know how to deal with an ISO-File,\nI decided to offer the VOB-Files. Have Fun.\n\n*******************************************************************************\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:644b0a9008b270eec4adf75a2b5eb86c808a4236","amp;dn":"Trains.Eurostar.CabRide.2004.COMPLETE.PAL.DVD5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"644b0a9008b270eec4adf75a2b5eb86c808a4236","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,75,10,144,8,178,112,238,196,173,247,90,43,94,184,108,128,138,66,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
