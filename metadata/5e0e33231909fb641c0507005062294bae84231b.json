The recording is a very good balanced \r\nprofessional board tape.\r\n\r\nAudience Source: Incomplete very good 1st audience recording. \r\nThis is kinda clear recording. The tape is rather close to the \r\nstage but there are some audience noise near the recorder from \r\ntime to time.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01. Train Kept A Rollin' (AUD)\r\n02. Nobody's Fault But Mine (AUD)\r\n03. Black Dog (AUD)\r\n04. In The Evening (AUD)\r\n05. The Rain Song (SBD)\r\n06. Hot Dog (SBD)\r\n07. All Of My Love (SBD)\r\n08. Trampled Underfoot (SBD)\r\n09. Since I've Been Loving You (SBD)\r\n10. Achilles Last Stand (SBD)\r\n11. White Summer (SBD)\r\n12. Kashmir (SBD)\r\n13. Stairway To Heaven (SBD)\r\n14. Rock And Roll (SBD)\r\n15. Heartbreaker (SBD)\r\n\r\nComments: \r\nA truly excellent and fiery show in front of a dull and restrained \r\ncrowd. The band is really playing well, and even Jimmy is on near \r\ntop form, playing with guts, cleanly and constructing exciting solos \r\nand his usual great guitar playing. Trampled Underfoot is a definite \r\nhighlight, and the encore of Heartbreaker is blistering","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e0e33231909fb641c0507005062294bae84231b","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1980.06.21+Rotterdam%2C+Netherlands+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e0e33231909fb641c0507005062294bae84231b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,14,51,35,25,9,251,100,28,5,7,0,80,98,41,75,174,132,35,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
