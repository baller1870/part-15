Since it&amp;#039;s a budget-line compilation, Super Hits doesn&amp;#039;t come close to matching that glorious set, but it&amp;#039;s a surprisingly effective summary of their T-Neck recordings, containing their biggest hits for the label -- &quot;It&amp;#039;s Your Thing,&quot; &quot;Fight the Power (Parts 1 &amp; 2),&quot; &quot;That Lady (Parts 1 &amp; 2),&quot; &quot;Who Loves You Better&quot; -- plus an interesting selection of smaller hits and album tracks, including &quot;Summer Breeze,&quot; &quot;Freedom&quot; and &quot;All in My Lover&amp;#039;s Eyes.&quot; It may not be definitive, but for casual fans on a strict budget, it certainly provides their money&amp;#039;s worth.
