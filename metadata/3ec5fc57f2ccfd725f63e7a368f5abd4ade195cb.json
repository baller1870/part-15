Although not the return to instrumental jazz some hoped it would be, this heartfelt effort does contain its share of jazz-influenced material. From a jazz standpoint, the CD's most noteworthy songs include Nascimento's &quot;Cravo e Canela,&quot; the charming &quot;Brazilian Sugar,&quot; &quot;Love Reborn,&quot; and the exuberant &quot;Up from the Sea It Arose and Ate Rio in One Swift Bite.&quot; Meanwhile, Nascimento's vocal on the ballad &quot;Ao Que Vai Nascer&quot; is a fine example of Brazilian pop at its most sensuous. But however one labels or categorizes this music, the album is clearly a labor of love from start to finish.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ec5fc57f2ccfd725f63e7a368f5abd4ade195cb","amp;dn":"George+Duke+-+A+Brazilian+Love+Affair+%5B24+Bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ec5fc57f2ccfd725f63e7a368f5abd4ade195cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,197,252,87,242,204,253,114,95,99,231,163,104,245,171,212,173,225,149,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
