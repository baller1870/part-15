With such blunt advice as, &quot;Soda is liquid Satan&quot; and &quot;You are a total moron if you think the Atkins Diet will make you thin,&quot; it's a rallying cry for all savvy women to start eating healthy and looking radiant. Unlike standard diet books, it actually makes the reader laugh out loud with its truthful, smart-mouthed revelations. Behind all the attitude, however, there's solid guidance. Skinny Bitch espouses a healthful lifestyle that promotes whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, and encourages women to get excited about feeling &quot;clean and pure and energized.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b62c52a42ebad0405424ba1baf85bbe29ce8dae2","amp;dn":"Skinny+Bitch+Book+%5B2005%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b62c52a42ebad0405424ba1baf85bbe29ce8dae2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,44,82,164,46,186,208,64,84,36,186,27,175,133,187,226,156,232,218,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
