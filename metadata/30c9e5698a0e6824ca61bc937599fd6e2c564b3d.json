This demo-tape style release was produced entirely by Jake One. It hasn't been polished up for the market or cleaned for the radio. These songs were left in their original demo form and are intended only for my family of direct supporters. The beats are grimy and I feel like this is some of the best rhyming I've ever captured on tape. I want to release this directly to you. \n\nYou can stream here, and for all those kind enough to buy any Brother Ali shirt on the War And Peace Tour this fall, you'll also receive a digital download card of the album with your purchase.  If the tour isn't coming to your city or you don't want to wait, don't worry, you can get the music immediately when you pre-order the &quot;Cassette&quot; shirt from Fifth Element.\n\nPeace, Love and Power!\nSee you soon, and thank you for your support.\n\n- Brother Ali\n\nTracklisting:\nSide A\nDial Tone\nGrandma And Them\nDigital Age\nNever Stoppin'\nNot A Day Goes By\n\nSide B\nWell Okay\nSteerange\nPhantom Of The Opera\nRapper Thing\nDevil's Arms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30c9e5698a0e6824ca61bc937599fd6e2c564b3d","amp;dn":"Brother+Ali+-+Left+in+the+Deck","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30c9e5698a0e6824ca61bc937599fd6e2c564b3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,201,229,105,138,14,104,36,202,97,188,147,117,153,253,110,44,86,75,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
