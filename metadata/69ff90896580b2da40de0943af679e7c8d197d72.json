The 130-minute DVD features footage documenting the 2006 return of Down from the practice room through the band's first European tour, and a bonus behind-the-scenes featurette entitled &quot;Tyrades and Shananigans&quot;.\n\nThe album is often mislabeled as &quot;Down IV&quot; as it is the fourth release by Down, although it is not a studio album. Another reason for this is that on the album's artwork, the Roman numeral for 6 (VI) is present. The Roman numeral for 6 is present because the album was recorded in 2006 (In the year of VI).\n\nThe vinyl release features completely different artwork under the title Threefold Live.\nLegal issues and delay\n\nThe live album was originally set for release on March 23, 2010. However, due to legal issues the album's release date was pushed back to October 5.\n\nTrack listing\n\nDisc 1\nNo. \tTitle \tRecorded \tLength \t\n\n1. \t&quot;Losing All&quot;   \t                          London, England \t5:06\n2. \t&quot;Lifer&quot;   \t                          London, England \t5:44\n3. \t&quot;Lysergik Funeral Procession&quot;   \t  London, England \t2:53\n4. \t&quot;Rehab&quot;   \t                          London, England \t6:09\n5. \t&quot;Temptations Wings&quot;   \t                  London, England \t6:05\n6. \t&quot;Ghosts Along the Mississippi&quot;   \t  London, England \t7:07\n7. \t&quot;Learn from This Mistake&quot;   \t          London, England \t8:22\n8. \t&quot;Hail the Leaf&quot;   \t                  London, England \t4:19\n9. \t&quot;New Orleans Is a Dying Whore&quot;            London, England \t4:45\nTotal length:\n\t50:25 \t\nDisc 2\nNo. \tTitle \tRecorded \tLength \t\n\n10. \t&quot;Lies, I Don't Know What They Say But...&quot;   London, England \t7:21\n11. \t&quot;Underneath Everything&quot;                     London, England \t5:19\n12. \t&quot;The Seed&quot;   \t                            London, England \t4:26\n13. \t&quot;Eyes of the South&quot;   \t                    London, England \t7:36\n14. \t&quot;Jail&quot;   \t                            London, England \t6:33\n15. \t&quot;Stone the Crow&quot;   \t                    London, England \t7:30\n16. \t&quot;Bury Me in Smoke&quot;   \t                    London, England \t11:55\nTotal length:\n\t50:35 \t\nCredits\n\n    Phil Anselmo - vocals\n    Pepper Keenan - guitars\n    Kirk Windstein - guitars\n    Jimmy Bower - drums\n    Rex Brown - bass\n\n    Layout &amp; Design - Pepper Keenan &amp; Vance Kelly\n    Artwork - Vance Kelly\n\nTour dates\nDate \tCity \tCountry \tVenue\nMay 19, 2006 \tHamburg \tGermany \tGrosse Freiheit\nMay 20, 2006 \tCologne \tLive Music Hall\nMay 21, 2006 \tTilburg \tNetherlands \t013\nMay 23, 2006 \tBirmingham \tEngland \tCarling Academy\nMay 24, 2006 \tNottingham \tRock City\nMay 25, 2006 \tNewcastle \tUniversity\nMay 27, 2006 \tGlasgow \tScotland \tABC\nMay 28, 2006 \tManchester \tEngland \tAcademy\nMay 29, 2006 \tLondon \tLondon Astoria\nMay 30, 2006\nJune 1, 2006 \tMilan \tItaly \tGods of Metal, Idroscalo\nJune 2, 2006 \tZurich \tSwitzerland \tRohstofflager\nJune 3, 2006 \tParis \tFrance \tÃƒâ€°lysÃƒÂ©e Montmartre\nJune 5, 2006 \tOslo \tNorway \tRockefeller\nJune 6, 2006 \tStockholm \tSweden \tArenan\nJune 7, 2006 \tCopenhagen \tDenmark \tVega\nJune 8, 2006 \tTampere \tFinland \tPakkahuone\nJune 10, 2006 \tCastle Donington \tEngland \tDownload Festival, Donington Park\nJune 12, 2006 \tBelfast \tNorthern Ireland \tMandela\nJune 13, 2006 \tDublin \tIreland \tAmbassador Theatre\nJune 24, 2006 \tNew Orleans, Louisiana \tUnited States \tTipitina's\n\nAs normal go to the shows and buy the merch,thats the best way to support the artist, all of that money goes to the band.
