A formidable boogie and blues pianist with a lovable growl of a voice, his most enduring achievements have fused New Orleans R&amp;B, rock, and Mardi Gras craziness to come up with his own brand of &quot;voodoo&quot; music. He's also quite accomplished and enjoyable when sticking to purely traditional forms of blues and R&amp;B. On record, he veers between the two approaches, making for an inconsistent and frequently frustrating legacy that often makes the listener feel as if the &quot;Night Tripper&quot; (as he's nicknamed himself) has been underachieving. ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:wifwxqe5ldhe~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:wifwxqe5ldhe~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nDr. John's debut for GRP doesn't deviate from any release he's made for several other labels. It's still his chunky, humorous take on New Orleans funk; these are his songs, visions and performances, and there's none of the elevator material or laidback, detached fare that's a customary GRP byproduct. Such songs as &quot;Witchy Red,&quot; &quot;Spaceship Relationship&quot; and the title selection are a delicate mix of seemingly outrageous but actually quite sharp commentary and excellent musical performances from Dr. John on keyboards, Hugh McCracken on guitar, and several other veterans, among them the great Red Tyler on tenor sax. While not quite as fiery as his classic sessions for Atlantic, if anyone can bring the funk to a company that's famous for avoiding it, it's Dr. John. \n\nTrack List:\n\n01. Television\n02.
