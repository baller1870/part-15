It looks at a broad survey of buildings, but focuses on specific &quot;megaprojects&quot; as examples for discussion: the Disney empire and its amusement parks in the context of public space and the IBA in Berlin in the context of domestic space. Its discussion of the reshaping of urban environment focuses on London's Dockland, the most ambitious and politically sensitive development in postwar Britain. It also considers the work of lesser-known designers and women architects as well as famous international stars","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1aa4bbea5f6d2a31c981a69850e51d7a7a6f5228","amp;dn":"Architecture+After+Modernism+%28World+of+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1aa4bbea5f6d2a31c981a69850e51d7a7a6f5228","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,164,187,234,95,109,42,49,201,129,166,152,80,229,29,122,122,111,82,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
