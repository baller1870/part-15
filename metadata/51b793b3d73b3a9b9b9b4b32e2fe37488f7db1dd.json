Born in 1981, Chris made his public debut at the age of four, playing with his father at a Texas gumbo cook-off; just five years later, he backed his grandfather during an appearance at Carnegie Hall. The child prodigy also soon joined his father's new band Lagniappe as a full-time member, but like Lawrence before him, Ardoin eventually rejected the confines of traditional zydeco to pursue his own muse; with his older brother Sean, cousin Alphonse and family friend Peter Jacobs, he formed the band Double Clutchin', the name representative of the kind of repeated bass drum kicks which define the funky &quot;new zydeco&quot; sound. Double Clutchin' debuted with 1994's That's Da Lick, recorded when bandleader Ardoin was just 13; Lick It Up! followed a year later, and in 1997 the group signed to Rounder for Gon' Be Jus' ine. Turn the Page followed in 1998 and Best Kept Secrets arrived two years later.\n\n\n\n01 - Chris Ardoin - Alter Ego Intro.mp3\n02 - Chris Ardoin - Shawty Whoa.mp3\n03 - Chris Ardoin - Make U Surrender.mp3\n04 - Chris Ardoin - Swagga.mp3\n05 - Chris Ardoin - One More Kiss.mp3\n06 - Chris Ardoin - I'm Off &amp; I'm Throwed.mp3\n07 - Chris Ardoin - Never Gave Up.mp3\n08 - Chris Ardoin - Rockin' The Stiletto.mp3\n09 - Chris Ardoin - Let Her Go.mp3\n10 - Chris Ardoin - Making It Worse.mp3\n11 - Chris Ardoin - Louisiana.mp3\n12 - Chris Ardoin - Walk Away.mp3\n13 - Chris Ardoin - Good Good.mp3\n14 - Chris Ardoin - Til The Sunrise.mp3\n15 - Chris Ardoin - Zydeco Freak.mp3\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51b793b3d73b3a9b9b9b4b32e2fe37488f7db1dd","amp;dn":"Chris+Ardoin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51b793b3d73b3a9b9b9b4b32e2fe37488f7db1dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,183,147,179,215,59,58,155,155,155,75,50,226,254,55,72,143,125,177,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
