These are just three amazing stories of interaction between the opposing sides in the Great War that eminent historian Richard van Emden has unearthedÃ¢â‚¬â€incidents that show brutality, great humanity, and, above all, the bizarre nature of a conflict between two nations with long-standing ties of kinship and friendship. Meeting the Enemy reveals for the first time how contact was maintained on many levels throughout the war, and its storiesÃ¢â‚¬â€sometimes funny, often movingÃ¢â‚¬â€give us a new perspective on the lives of ordinary men and women caught up in extraordinary events.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8b37f0a2f00db9ab1231e2c4f2ca24e50ba8a0b","amp;dn":"Meeting+the+Enemy+-+The+Human+Face+of+the+Great+War+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8b37f0a2f00db9ab1231e2c4f2ca24e50ba8a0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,179,127,10,47,0,219,154,177,35,30,44,79,44,162,78,80,186,138,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
