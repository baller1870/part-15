Members of the E Street Band played on the album but seldom in full-band arrangements. Then, too, there are the deeply conflicted songs (Brilliant Disguise, Two Faces, Tunnel of Love, One Step Up) that may have been written in response to the imminent failure of his first marriage. There's more to the album than divorce-court play-by-play, however. There's also the raw rocker Spare Parts, the sprightly All That Heaven Will Allow, and the bold declaration Tougher Than the Rest. Overall, these are some of his most thoughtful songs and most intimate performances.\n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 83\nArtist: Bruce Springsteen\nAlbum: Tunnel of Love\nYear: 1987\nGenre: Rock\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88673aff773dca64b23f90ac6c466f9a78c4d9d3","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen+-+Tunnel+of+Love+%5BFLAC-1987%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88673aff773dca64b23f90ac6c466f9a78c4d9d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,103,58,255,119,61,202,100,178,63,144,172,108,70,111,154,120,196,217,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
