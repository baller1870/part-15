This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\nIn this countdown:\n\nCasey plays a piece of the song to spend the most weeks at number 1 in the rock era, &quot;Cherry Pink And Apple Blossom White&quot; by Perez Prado.\n\nThe largest span of time between the debut of a television show and the debut of its theme song in the top 40 is only 22 years thanks to a song in this countdown.\n\nA listener wants to know if any British acts hit number 1 before the Beatles. Casey says two acts did, both with instrumentals.\n\nThere is a band in the countdown whose members were hand-picked to play for Linda Ronstadt, but decided to play on their own and ended up making rock history.\n\nThe theme at the end of the show is called Shuckatoom. It was written by James R. Kirk who composed the very first AT40 theme in 1970. The tune was never made available separate from the show itself. It was first heard at the close of the &quot;Top 40 Rock &amp; Roll Acts of the 1950s&quot; special on October 4, 1975, which I'll try to get out in October, but for now you can listen to that broadcast here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.top40usa.net/Media/Default.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.top40usa.net/Media/Default.aspx&lt;/a&gt;\n\n40: New York You Got Me Down - Andrea True Connection\n39: Love In C Minor - Cerone\n38: Something About You - Latimore\n37: Couldn't Get It Right - Climax Blues Band\n36: I Wanna Get Next To You - Rose Royce\n35: When I Need You - Leo Sayer\n34: All Strung Out On You - John Travolta\n33: At Midnight - Rufus\n32: Lido Shuffle - Boz Scaggs\n31: Year Of The Cat - Al Stewart\n30: Disco Lucy - Wilton Place Street Band\n29: Blinded By The Night - Manfred Mann's Earth Band\n28: Free - Deniece Williams\n27: The First Cut Is The Deepest - Rod Stewart\n26: Gloria - Enchantment\n25: Do Ya - ELO\n24: Trying To Love Two - William Bell\n23: Here Comes Those Tears Again - Jackson Browne\n22: Sam - Olivia Newton-John\n21: Right Time Of The Night - Jennifer Warnes\n20: Boogie Child - Bee Gees\n19: Crackerbox Palace - George Harrison\n18: Go Your Own Way - Fleetwood Mac\n17: Hotel California - Eagles\n16: Southern Nights - Glen Campbell\n15: Say You'll Stay Until Tomorrow - Tom Jones\n14: So Into You - Atlanta Rhythm Section\n13: Carry On Wayward Son - Kansas\n12: I've Got Love On My Mind - Natalie Cole\n11: Maybe I'm Amazed - Wings\n10: Torn Between Two Lovers - Mary Macgregor\n9: I Like Dreamin' - Kenny Nolan\n8: The Things We Do For Love - 10cc\n7: Night Moves - Bob Seger\n6: Fly Like An Eagle - Steve Miller Band\n5: Don't Leave This Way - Thelma Houston\n4: Don't Give Up On Us - David Soul\n3: Dancing Queen - ABBA\n2: Evergreen - Barbra Streisand\n1: Rich Girl - Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f35a3e31638fe23db5f22f26e30c04bc81bca81f","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1977_March_26th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f35a3e31638fe23db5f22f26e30c04bc81bca81f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,90,62,49,99,143,226,61,181,242,47,38,227,12,4,188,129,188,168,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
