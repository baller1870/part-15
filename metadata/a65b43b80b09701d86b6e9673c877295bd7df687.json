Working with an even wider palette of colors at the band&amp;#039;s disposal (with samples, exotic synths, and various delays added to the bag of tricks), Kukl has somehow crafted a record that makes its dense debut seem like a picture book by comparison. Indeed, if The Eye was a record that flirted with lunacy, then Holidays in Europe is gunning to chew right through the wrist restraints. Although the intensity and ambition are hard to deny, it&amp;#039;s obvious that these songs are the product of a band at odds with itself. With internal sabotage evident at every turn, Kukl would not last much longer; some of the group&amp;#039;s core members would go on to form the buoyant Sugarcubes as a reaction.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a65b43b80b09701d86b6e9673c877295bd7df687","amp;dn":"KUKL+%28bjork+pre+sugarcubes%29+-+Holidays+in+Europe+%281986%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a65b43b80b09701d86b6e9673c877295bd7df687","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,91,67,184,11,9,112,29,134,182,233,103,60,135,114,149,189,125,246,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
