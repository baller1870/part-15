It also converts images among formats. UltraISO supports data and audio/video discs and includes a simple MP3 encoder, but it really excels at creating bootable discs. It even can create a disc with a menu for booting several OSs.\nThe interface is well organized, though rather plain, and we wish its icons were more readable. Also on the negative side, the program can't mount CD images, which will diminish its value for some. However, if you need support for multiple image formats and want to design bootable discs, UltraISO makes a very good pick.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSharing is Caring...........
