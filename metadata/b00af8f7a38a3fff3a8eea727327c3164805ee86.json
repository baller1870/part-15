The latest in computer-generated images allow us to look at plants growing, self-replicating, responding to external factors and even mutating, without becoming entangled in the underlying mathematical formulae involved. The authors place particular emphasis on Lindenmayer systems - a notion conceived by one of the authors, Aristid Lindenmayer, and internationally recognised for its exceptional elegance in modelling biological phenomena. Nonetheless, the two authors take great care to present a survey of alternative methods for plant modelling. \n\n\nAuthors: Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz, Aristid Lindenmayer.\nPages: 228\nPublisher: Springer\nDate: 1996-03-27\n\n-_-\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b00af8f7a38a3fff3a8eea727327c3164805ee86","amp;dn":"The+Algorithmic+Beauty+of+Plants","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b00af8f7a38a3fff3a8eea727327c3164805ee86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,10,248,247,163,138,63,255,58,142,234,114,115,39,195,22,72,5,238,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
