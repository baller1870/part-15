On a deeper level, this play shows the decay of a person who chooses material gains (by commanding the devils to suit his desires) over spiritual belief and in doing so, loses his soul. Doctor Faustus was first published in 1604, eleven years after Marlowe&amp;#039;s death and at least twelve years after the first performance of the play.\n\n&quot;No Elizabethan play outside the Shakespeare canon has raised more controversy than Doctor Faustus. There is no agreement concerning the nature of the text and the date of composition...and the centrality of the Faust legend in the history of the Western world precludes any definitive agreement on the interpretation of the play....&quot; ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tragical_History_of_Doctor_Faustus )\n\nOne episode of approximately 90 minutes in high quality MP3.\n\nWith:\n-----\nFaustus....Paterson Joseph\nMephistopheles....Ray Fearon\nWagner....Toby Jones\nEvil Angel....Janet McTeer\nGood Angel/Duchess....Tanya Moodie\nLucifer....Julian Bleach\nOld Man....David Bradley\nRobin....Nicholas Burns\nRafe....Iain Robertson\nValdes/Pope....David Bamber\nCornelius....Paul Bazely\nEmperor....Anton Lesser\nScholar/Horse-Courser....John Lloyd Fillingham\nScholar/Knight....Don Gilet\nScholar/Duke....Derek Riddell\n\nOriginal music composed by Olly Fox.\n\n---------------------\nType : mpeg 1 layer III\nBitrate : 128\nMode : joint stereo\nFrequency : 48000 Hz\nEncoder : Lame 3.96\n---------------------\n\n/c\\ Ubuntu+MythTV+LAME+DVB-T=MP3 http://cheops.fm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9e89f2c25396dba32d427cb00b4f0bd34b0e90b","amp;dn":"Doctor+Faustus+-+by+Christopher+Marlowe+-+BBC+Radio+Full-Cast+dr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9e89f2c25396dba32d427cb00b4f0bd34b0e90b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,232,159,44,37,57,109,186,50,212,39,203,0,180,240,189,52,176,233,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
