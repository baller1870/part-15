While the Dragon Quest VII Symphonic Suite is not nearly as cohesive and does not have the same kind of thematic continuity as Sugiyama's previous efforts in the Dragon Quest series, it is still a very enjoyable suite. The thing that makes this album stand out among the rest of the Symphonic Suites is the fact that Sugiyama's experimentations, mostly in orchestration, have reached their peak here. There are some truly inspired combinations to be found here, with &quot;Screams from the Tower of Monsters&quot; standing out as a particularly noteworthy effort. There were only two recordings of this suite, the first by the London Philharmonic Orchestra and the most recent by the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra. In this review, I will focus on the enjoyment of the tracks by themselves and also compare and contrast the two available recordings. \n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img232.imageshack.us/img232/3303/coveroo6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img232.imageshack.us/img232/3303/coveroo6.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTitolo: Dragon Quest VII Symphonic Suite &amp; OST\nAnno: 2000\nAutore: Koichi Sugiyama\nEseguita da: London Symphonic Orchestra (CD1) Square / Enix (CD2)\nGenere: Colonna Sonora\nEtichetta: SPE Visual Works\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\nDisco 1 (Symphonic Suite)\n01 - Overture\n02 - Morning in Eden\n03 - Saraband\n04 - Echo of Horns throughout the Castle\n05 - Heavenly Village\n06 - Days of Sadness\n07 - Strolling in the Town\n08 - Memories of a Lost World ~ Moving Through the Present\n09 - Shadow of Death\n10 - Fighting Spirit ~ World of the Strong\n11 - Sphinx ~ Mysterious Sanctuary\n12 - Aboard Ship ~ Pirates of the Sea\n13 - To My Loved One\n14 - Screams from the Tower of Monsters\n15 - With Sadness in Heart ~ A Safe Haven\n16 - Magic Carpet\n17 - Over the Horizon\n18 - Orgo Demila\nTotal Time: 71'55&quot;\n\nDisco 2 (Original Soundtrack)\n01 - Triumphal Return ~ Epilogue\n02 - Overture VII\n03 - Intermezzo\n04 - Morning in Eden\n05 - Saraband\n06 - Echo of Horns Throughout the Castle\n07 - Heavenly Village\n08 - Days of Sadness\n09 - Relaxing Corner\n10 - Paradise\n11 - Garden of Time\n12 - Banquet Plaza\n13 - Memories of a Lost World\n14 - Moving Through the Present\n15 - Shadow of Death\n16 - Fighting Spirit\n17 - World of the Strong\n18 - Sphinx\n19 - Mysterious Sanctuary\n20 - Aboard Ship ~ Pirates of the Sea\n21 - To My Loved One\n22 - Revival Prayer\n23 - Toura Dance\n24 - Screams from the Tower of Monsters\n25 - With Sadness in Heart\n26 - A Safe Haven\n27 - Magic Carpet\n28 - Over the Horizon\n29 - Orgo Demila\n30 - Triumphal Return ~ Epilogue\nTotal Time: 68'00''","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b60f16604006bec3ae5aa19bba5a6fef73f6069","amp;dn":"Koichi+Sugiyama+-+Dragon+Quest+7+Symphonic+Suite+%26+OST+%5BMp3+224+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b60f16604006bec3ae5aa19bba5a6fef73f6069","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,96,241,102,4,0,107,236,58,229,170,25,187,165,166,254,247,63,96,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
