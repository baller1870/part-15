I Would Love You in the Kitchen (04:10)\n\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Be There Tomorrow is an extremely diverse album that can only be described as experimental country and blues with a couple of covers mixed in. The musical arrangements and instrumentation on each song are perfect backdrops creating the moods and settings for The Sumner BrothersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ stories. Not only are the arrangements spot-on, but their vocals are terrifically suited for this grungy, rootsy, bluesy, country music.\n\nFiercely opening with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Toughest Man In The Prison Camp,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ an experimental, garage, punk-like blues tune with the muscular sound of crashing percussion, screaming guitars, and BrianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rough, howling vocals. This is definitely a statement song demanding attention and telling the listeners that The Sumner Brothers mean business. Simply put, they ainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t playinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, son! The brothers then move into something more haunting in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Going Out West.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ In this song, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll hear guitar strumming, some banjo plucking, and the tumbleweed-blown sound of a steel guitar while Bob expresses turmoil in his somewhat pained vocals. For me, the song has a Dust Bowl feel and sound with a modern twist. Then, they move into a stunning cover of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Coloardo GirlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that would garner Townes Van ZandtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s approval. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lay You In The GraveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a daring combination of country and western music with a cynical attitude while Ã¢â‚¬Å“You Will Find MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has a slightly different stance and gentler sound. Toward the end of the album The Sumner Brothers perform a loud and raw cover of Arthur Ã¢â‚¬Å“Big BoyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ CrudupsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Alright.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Closing with the quiet and sleepy instrumental Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Would Love You In The KitchenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is an appropriate end to the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bold sound.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:839751060eb4cb5d5aee39d29e6a5f91e721af9d","amp;dn":"The+Sumner+Brothers+-+I%27ll+Be+There+Tomorrow+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"839751060eb4cb5d5aee39d29e6a5f91e721af9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,151,81,6,14,180,203,93,90,238,57,210,158,106,95,145,231,33,175,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
