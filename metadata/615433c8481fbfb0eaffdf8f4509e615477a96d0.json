Cambridge, where Ralph Waldo Emerson delivered his powerful speeches is highlighted, as is Walden, where Henry David Thoreau spent two years attuning himself to the rhythms of nature. Other chapters retrace the paths of major writers and poets of the period as well as the utopian communities of the time. This invaluable traveling companion offers street maps, historical illustrations, and narratives that create a vivid sense of New England in the 19th century.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:615433c8481fbfb0eaffdf8f4509e615477a96d0","amp;dn":"A+Journey+into+the+Transcendentalists%27+New+England+%28ArtPlace+ser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"615433c8481fbfb0eaffdf8f4509e615477a96d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,84,51,200,72,31,191,176,234,255,223,143,69,9,230,21,71,122,150,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
