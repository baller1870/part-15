King. In truth, Fulson gave King &quot;Three O'Clock Blues,&quot; which became a hit for King in the '50s. British label JSP does its best to present a more complete picture of Fulson with the four-CD box set Lowell Fulson 1946 to 1953. A superb collection, the set traces the rise of Fulson from obscure Oklahoma guitar slinger to &quot;chitlin circuit&quot; blues star. ~ Matt Collar\n\n\n 1. Sinner's Prayer (Alt) 2:11 \n 2.
