Your city starts with three stations. Draw routes between these stations to connect them with subway lines. Commuters travel along your lines to get around the city as fast as they can. Each station can only hold a handful of waiting commuters so your subway network will need to be well-designed to avoid delays.\nThe city is growing. More stations are opening, and commuters are appearing faster. The demands on your network are ever-increasing. You'll be constantly redesigning your lines to maximise efficiency. The new assets you earn every week will help immensely Ã¢â‚¬â€ as long as they're used wisely.\nEventually your network will fail. Stations will open too quickly. Commuters will crowd the platforms. How long the city keeps moving is up to you.&quot;\n\nKey features:\n- Compelling, constructive, hectic, relaxed gameplay. If that makes sense. It doesn't though, aye? You just gotta play it.\n- Three game modes: Commuter for quick scored games, Scenic for stress-free sandbox play, and Rush Hour for the ultimate challenge. (only Commuter is in so far, Scenic will follow soon)\n- Three real-world cities to design subways for (London, New York City and Paris), with many more being added before release. Each has a unique colour theme, set of obstacles, and pace.\n- Random city growth, so each game plays out differently. A strategy that proved successful last game may not help you in the next.\n- Each game's map is a work of art, built by you in the classic abstract subway style of Harry Beck. If you think it's a keeper, save it, tweet it, show it off or make it your desktop background!\n- Soundtrack by Disasterpeace (well, not quite yet ... but he's working on it!)\n- Colorblind and night modes.\n- Trains! Did we mention them yet?\n\nChangelog: see changelog.txt.\n\nIf you like the game, support the developer, buy it! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/287980/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/287980/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6b5633e01daaba027c80905ecde6107813b7cf9","amp;dn":"Mini+Metro+Beta+12","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6b5633e01daaba027c80905ecde6107813b7cf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,181,99,62,1,218,171,160,39,200,9,5,236,222,97,7,129,59,124,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
