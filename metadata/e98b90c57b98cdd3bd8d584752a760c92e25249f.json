Oliver Strange died in 1952, and the series was revived by Frederick H. Christian in the 1960s. Christian classified the books as &quot;Piccadilly westerns&quot;, that is books written by English authors, simply drawing on the conventions the genre, with no first hand experience of America. The Sudden books are among the earliest and best-loved of the type. Sudden is portrayed as an intrepid and accurate gunfighter in search of two men who cheated his foster father. James Green earns the nickname &quot;Sudden&quot; because of his lightning speed with a gun. Sudden is portrayed as a stereotypical gunfighter: an intelligent and resourceful drifting cowboy who is respectful of the law, unwilling to use a gun unless absolutely necessary, humanitarian, brave, strong, and fair. The first book was published in 1930 and was followed by 10 more until the 1940s and featured vivid descriptions of the western American landscape, rare in an author at that time. The series became popular for its exciting narrations combining elements of mystery, suspense, and action, with engaging characters, in a Wild West setting of dusty towns, ranches, and saloons.\n\nThis torrent contains all the 10 Sudden Novels by Oliver Strange sorted in chronological order.\n\nContents:\nSuddenÃ¢â‚¬â€Outlawed\nSudden \nSuddenÃ¢â‚¬â€Gold Seeker\nSudden Rides Again \nSudden Makes War \nSudden Takes the Trail \nSudden Plays a Hand \nThe Marshal of Lawless \nThe Range Robbers \nThe Law o' the Lariat","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e98b90c57b98cdd3bd8d584752a760c92e25249f","amp;dn":"Sudden+Series+by+Oliver+Strange","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e98b90c57b98cdd3bd8d584752a760c92e25249f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,139,144,197,123,152,205,211,189,141,88,71,82,167,96,201,46,37,36,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
