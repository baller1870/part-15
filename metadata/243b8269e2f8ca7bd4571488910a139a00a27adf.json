The album was released on Kill Rock Stars on February 25, 1997 on compact disc and vinyl LP.\n\nThe title is derived from the SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸ren Kierkegaard book of the same name, reflecting Smith's interest in philosophy, something he studied (among other subjects) at Hampshire College in Massachusetts. Smith stated in a few interviews that the album follows Kierkegaard's philosophy in relation to the absurdist struggle between choosing an aesthetic life and an ethical life.
