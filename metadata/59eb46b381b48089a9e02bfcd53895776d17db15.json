Told in a hauntingly \n\nperceptive tone, this critically-acclaimed film is one of the most powerful and insightful films \n\never made on the overwhelming destructiveness of nuclear power. By using extraordinary and rarely \n\nseen archival footage, much of which was once kept classified by the U.S. government, director \n\nRobert Stone brings to light the largely untold story of Bikini Atoll. A peaceful and tropical \n\nisland located in the Pacific, it was the unwitting site of a series of high-profile atomic bomb \n\ntests conducted by the U.S. in 1946. With startling eyewitness accounts by a naval serviceman and \n\nthe chief of the native Bikinians, the film reveals the stark reality of these tests- thought to \n\nbe harmless, they instead left Bikini island uninhabitable for over 40 years and exposed thousands \n\nof sailors to heavy doses of radiation. The film's virtually surreal footage of sailors fishing in \n\ncontaminated waters, mushroom clouds filling the skies, and top level government officials \n\nprofessing the safety of the tests leaves us in utter shock and disbelief- how could something \n\nso horrific have gone untold for so long?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59eb46b381b48089a9e02bfcd53895776d17db15","amp;dn":"Radio+Bikini+%28rare+documentary%29+INFOFALLOUT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59eb46b381b48089a9e02bfcd53895776d17db15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,235,70,179,129,180,128,137,169,224,43,252,213,56,149,119,109,23,219,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
