The song was recorded at RCA Victor Studio B in Hollywood, on July 25, 1966. and was already on the Boss Hit Bounds on 17 August 1966. The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 on November 5, 1966. \n\nThe song has been compared to The Beatles's &quot;Paperback Writer,&quot; particularly the &quot;jangly&quot; guitar sound, the chord structure and the vocal harmonies. The Beatles song had been number one in the US charts three months earlier.\n\nThe song refers to Clarksville, Tennessee, which is in close proximity to Fort Campbell, Kentucky, the home of the 101st Airborne Division, which served in Vietnam during the Vietnam War.\n\nThe plot involves a phone call to his wife, or his girlfriend, from a young man who has been drafted, requesting that she &quot;take the last train to Clarksville&quot; so that they might have one last night together before he has to leave for his deployment on his morning train, because he does not know if he will be coming back from the war.\n\nThe Monkees were an American pop band that released music under their original incarnation between 1966 and 1970, with subsequent reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed. Assembled in Los Angeles in 1965 by Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the American television series The Monkees, which aired from 1966Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1968, the musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork, and Englishman Davy Jones. The band's music was initially supervised by producer Don Kirshner. \n\nDescribed by band member Micky Dolenz as initially being &quot;a TV show about an imaginary band [...] that wanted to be The Beatles, [but] that was never successful&quot;, the actor-musicians soon became a real band. As Dolenz would later describe it, &quot;The Monkees really becoming a band was like the equivalent of Leonard Nimoy really becoming a Vulcan.&quot; \n\nFor the first few months of their almost five-year initial career, the four actor-musicians were only allowed limited roles in the recording studio. This was due in part to the excessive time spent filming the TV series, which in turn limited the amount of time available to the group to rehearse and coalesce as a band. Nonetheless, Nesmith did compose and produce some songs from the beginning, and Peter Tork contributed limited guitar work on the Nesmith-produced sessions. They soon fought for and earned the right to collectively supervise all musical output under the band's name. Although the sitcom was canceled in 1968, the band continued to record music through 1971. \n\nThe Monkees had a number of international hits, including &quot;Last Train to Clarksville&quot;, &quot;I'm a Believer&quot;, &quot;Pleasant Valley Sunday&quot;, and &quot;Daydream Believer&quot;. At their peak in 1967, the band outsold both the Beatles and Rolling Stones. As of 2012, their albums and singles have sold over 65 million copies worldwide.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Train_to_Clarksville&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Train_to_Clarksville&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AAoFAAAFn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AAoFAAAFn&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video : MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 6000kbps\n   Audio1: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz 6ch 448kbps    \n   Audio2: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps\n   Duration: 00:02:31\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
