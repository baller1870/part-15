This is the only complete soundboard from the first leg of the 1999 tour widely circulating which is not sourced from video (the Houston 29th December 1982 recording comes from the video footage), so having something this special in this stunning quality is very special indeed. This show is extremely unusual in the respect that both 'Head' and 'Uptown' make an appearance during the first half of the show in place of 'D.M.S.R' which is played as a closing encore following '1999'. The only downside to this is that the piano segment contains only one track, and even the short instrumental intro of 'With You' is not performed. The show is extremely lengthy and one of the longest of the entire tour due in part to the two rare inclusions in the first half of the show and a very lengthy 10 minute version of 'International Lover' with an extended &quot;seduction speech&quot; which is laughably cheesy. The quality of the recording is certainly an improvement over the City Lights release in that some of the light hiss has been removed and the audio is far more powerful. Unfortunately the 2 second drop-out during the outro of 'Lady Cab Driver' is still here as is the sound glitch during 'How Come U Don't Call Me Anymore' - although these are merely observations and not criticisms.* As with the other recent 4DaFunk Soundboard Series releases sourced from the City Lights set, I wouldn't class these as replacement releases - they are more updated versions of much-loved classics.\n\n\n*Per 4DF Artwork: &quot;In this version 2.0, the long silence gap in 'Lady Cab Driver'has been filled and the sound glitch on 'How Come U Don't Call Me Anymore' has been fixed.&quot;\n\n__________________________________\n\nIf you want more, say more, whore!\n\n&quot;Let's work-- I'm not fuckin around!&quot;\n\n2013-11-30, thewaymouth international lovin it out on the dock of The Pirate Bay\n\nNOVEMBER 30\n\nJUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER DAY.\n\n&quot;...I ain't got time to play/ Girl didn't say too much/ She just said, 'Are you gay?'/ That took me by surprise/ Didn't know what to do/ Just looked that girl in the eyes/ And I said, 'No, is your momma?!'&quot;\n\n\n- Agustin Gomez-Arcos, 'A Bird Burned Alive,' (1988)...\n\n&quot;Often in winter the end of the day is like the final metaphor in a poem celebrating death: \n\nthere is no way out.&quot;\n\n\nRecordings\n1985 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mountains (Washington Avenue Warehouse, Eden Prairie, MN, USA)\n\nMiscellaneous\n1986 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ A configuration of the triple-album Crystal Ball is sequenced (a different album than the 1998 release Crystal Ball)\n\nConcerts\n1984 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Landover, MD, USA: Capital Centre\n1982 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Detroit, MI, USA: Masonic Temple Auditorium\n\n- &quot;Don't y'all wanna play?&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddebe9266b8ecaabc1b18fb430211f235645e3b6","amp;dn":"Prince+-+Detroit+%2782+V2.0+%281999+Tour+SBD+FLAC+4DaFunk%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddebe9266b8ecaabc1b18fb430211f235645e3b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,235,233,38,107,142,202,171,193,177,143,180,48,33,31,35,86,69,227,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
