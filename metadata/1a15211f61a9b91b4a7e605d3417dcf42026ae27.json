The book begins by noting that (Page 6): &quot;The lure of a new life in fabulous Texas, with land and riches thrown in, proved irresistible to thousands of Americans in the decades after 1822. . . .&quot;\n\nThe story includes some impressive figures, such as Stephen Austin, Sam Houston, Davey Crockett, and Ben McCulloch. The first chapter features the development of an influx of Americans into Texas, then under Mexican sovereignty. Moses Austin and his son Stephen are highlighted here. A map on page 17 shows the shifting boundaries of Texas.\n\nThere follows the story of the Alamo and San Jacinto. Then, the Republic of Texas is born, followed by the pathway to statehood. In the process, we read of the conflict between the Texans and native Americans; we read of the developing culture of Texas; the story of the economy of Texas is told.\n\nAll in all, a nice introduction to Texas as a part of this series. . . .&quot;\n\nAmazon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a15211f61a9b91b4a7e605d3417dcf42026ae27","amp;dn":"The+Texans+%28Time-Life%2C+The+Old+West+Series%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a15211f61a9b91b4a7e605d3417dcf42026ae27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,21,33,31,97,169,185,27,74,126,96,93,52,23,220,244,32,38,174,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
