Shu is a big fan of Inori, a singer who has taken the Internet world by storm. However, he also discovers the other side of her, which is that she is a member of &quot;Undertakers&quot;, a resistance group that aims to liberate Japan from the GHQ. Shu starts taking part in the actions of &quot;Undertaker&quot; and the &quot;king's mark&quot; appears on his right hand after the Void Genome in his pocket was shot by a GHQ Endlave. This &quot;mark&quot; bestows on him the power to reach inside another person's body and extract and materialize a weapon from it.[2] The anime tells the story of Shu's reluctant involvement with the Undertakers and his acceptance of his power.\n\n\n\n\nRelease date      : February 10, 2012\n\nAudio language    : Japanese\n\nSubTitle language : English\n\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\n\nComplete name                            : [Commie] Guilty Crown - 16 [A9F55A7F].mkv\nFormat                                   : Matroska\nFormat version                           : Version 2\nFile size                                : 274 MiB\nDuration                                 : 22mn 54s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 669 Kbps\n\n\nVideo\n\n\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;625352222e574c52&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 16 frames\nCodec ID                                 : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                                 : 22mn 54s\nWidth                                    : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                                   : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate                               : 23.976 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 10 bits\n\n\nAudio\n\n\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : A_AAC\nDuration                                 : 22mn 54s\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nTitle                                    : Commie\nLanguage                                 : Japanese\nDefault                                  : Yes\nForced                                   : No","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c032d32a823e477a0ab89ed70032efe3feae2792","amp;dn":"%5BCommie%5D+Guilty+Crown+-+16+%5BA9F55A7F%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c032d32a823e477a0ab89ed70032efe3feae2792","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,50,211,42,130,62,71,122,10,184,158,215,0,50,239,227,254,174,39,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
