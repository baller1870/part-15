A 15-song retrospective covering five albums, The Best of Dark Horse contains nearly every gem from 33 1/3, George Harrison, Somewhere in England, Gone Troppo, and Cloud Nine, including &quot;Crackerbox Palace,&quot; &quot;All Those Years Ago,&quot; &quot;Got My Mind Set on You,&quot; &quot;Cloud 9,&quot; &quot;When We Was Fab,&quot; and the lovely &quot;Blow Away.&quot; For most casual fans, the record will be a welcome summation of a hit-and-miss era of Harrison's career.\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine, AMG\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTrack listing:\n---------------\n\nAll songs by George Harrison, except where noted.\n\n   1. &quot;Poor Little Girl&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:33\n   2. &quot;Blow Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59\n   3. &quot;That's The Way It Goes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34\n   4. &quot;Cockamamie Business&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:15\n          * Tracks 1 &amp; 4 are exclusive new recordings for this album\n   5. &quot;Wake Up My Love&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32\n   6. &quot;Life Itself&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:24\n   7. &quot;Got My Mind Set On You&quot; (Rudy Clark) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51\n   8. &quot;Crackerbox Palace&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n   9. &quot;Cloud 9&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:14\n  10. &quot;Here Comes The Moon&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09\n  11. &quot;Gone Troppo&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:23\n  12. &quot;When We Was Fab&quot; (George Harrison/Jeff Lynne) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n  13. &quot;Love Comes To Everyone&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40\n  14. &quot;All Those Years Ago&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44\n  15. &quot;Cheer Down&quot; (George Harrison/Tom Petty) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08\n          * Also featured in the film Lethal Weapon 2\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:\n  \nThe Best Of George Harrison (Best of Dark Horse 1976-1989) is George Harrison's second official compilation album and was released in 1991. It follows up on both his successful comeback album Cloud Nine in 1987 and the Harrison-led Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 the following year, also a big seller.\n\nA fine summation of his period thus far on his own Dark Horse Records label, ranging from 1976's Thirty Three &amp; 1/3 to Cloud Nine and beyond, Best of Dark Horse 1976-1989 surprisingly failed to chart in the UK and only made #132 in the US.\n\nThe Best Of George Harrison, originally distributed through Warner Bros. Records, went out of print some years after its release, without being reissued by EMI when it acquired Harrison's entire Dark Horse catalogue. Specially for this release, Harrison recorded two new songs, &quot;Poor Little Girl&quot; and &quot;Cockamamie Business&quot;, while also including his Lethal Weapon 2 soundtrack song &quot;Cheer Down&quot; for good measure. These songs were not included as bonus tracks in the remastered edition of Cloud Nine, so this is the only release in which these three songs can be found, despite the fact that it is out of print. With no definitive career-spanning Harrison compilation yet available, 1976's The Best of George Harrison is currently the only Harrison retrospective on offer.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nComplete Artwork Included.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\nP.S.: After you've done, please someone upload this to Demonoid.
