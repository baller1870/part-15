First, you'll learn about the fundamental object-oriented design principle of Encapsulation, and then you'll learn about the five SOLID principles, also known as 'the principles of object-oriented design.' While this course is aimed at beginner to intermediate developers, it's based on decades of experience, so even advanced programmers can learn a thing or two. There are plenty of code examples along the way; while they're written in C#, they should be easily understandable to readers of Java or other curly-brace-based languages.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:562c9cbb20729d6f10e2221140a8960571535272","amp;dn":"Pluralsight+-+Encapsulation+and+SOLID","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"562c9cbb20729d6f10e2221140a8960571535272","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,44,156,187,32,114,157,111,16,226,34,17,64,168,150,5,113,83,82,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
