The cast and crew get a trip  \n                    abroad. But not to Venice, because as episode  \n                    writer Toby Whithouse explains, modern day  \n                    Venice doesn't really look like 16th century  \n                    Venice anymore. Instead the episode is shot in  \n                    Trogir, a small medieval town in Croatia that  \n                    is the spitting image of 16th century Venice.  \n                    However, Matt Smith and Toby Whithouse do go to  \n                    Venice and meet up with Francesco Da Mosto, who  \n                    gives them a unique tour on his boat.    \n                                                         \n                                                                                                \n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n                     \n                        Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0aa8d24181efe49dcbcbab04f7e539247dd6a80e","amp;dn":"Doctor.Who.Confidential.S05E06.HDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0aa8d24181efe49dcbcbab04f7e539247dd6a80e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,168,210,65,129,239,228,157,203,203,171,4,247,229,57,36,125,214,168,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
