Harriet Vanger, a scion of one of Sweden's wealthiest families, disappeared over forty years ago. All these years later, her aged uncle continues to seek the truth. He hires Mikael Blomkvist, a crusading journalist recently trapped by a libel conviction, to investigate. He is aided by the pierced and tattooed punk prodigy Lisbeth Salander. Together they tap into a vein of unfathomable iniquity and corruption in this extraordinary adaptation of the international publishing phenomenon.\n\nThanks goes to theProletariat for this release.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e907cd0d26894bec629faff8fd9a5e4b41613bb5","amp;dn":"The+Girl+with+the+Dragon+Tattoo+Book+1+%282012%29+%28theProletariat-No","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e907cd0d26894bec629faff8fd9a5e4b41613bb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,7,205,13,38,137,75,236,98,159,175,248,253,154,94,75,65,97,59,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
