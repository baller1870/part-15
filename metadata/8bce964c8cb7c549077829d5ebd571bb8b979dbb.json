In the appetizer basket they find a favorite grandma leftover: a coffee can of bacon grease. The three feisty grandmas who make it to the entree round must make meatloaf mix work with an aptly named cocktail. And the judges can't wait to get some grandmotherly love served up with their oatmeal desserts.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 04-Mar-2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bce964c8cb7c549077829d5ebd571bb8b979dbb","amp;dn":"Chopped.S19E03.Grandma.vs.Grandma.HDTV.x264-pwe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bce964c8cb7c549077829d5ebd571bb8b979dbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,206,150,76,140,183,197,73,7,120,41,213,235,213,113,187,139,151,157,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
