One stands out above all others. It is the Authorized King James Bible. Here is a Book, the Holy Bible, written by forty male authors, writing from three continents, through a period of more than 1,800 years, and it displays a mathematical miracle, dealing with historical events, that no computer could display. What particular quirk of perverted logic would lead any &quot;modern man&quot; to overlook such a Book? Alongside this Book, the Holy Bible, all other &quot;holy writings&quot; are just cheap, shallow, superficial, religious nonsense. A man is a deluded fool to bet against the Book.\n-Using history and prophecy, Dr. Ruckman shows how the Holy Bible surpasses all other so-called Ã¢â‚¬Å“sacred booksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and human philosophies from the very first verse.\n-The mathematical phenomena discussed in this work have never been duplicated by any author, any scientist, or any computer in six millennia.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDr. Peter S. Ruckman received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Alabama and finished his formal education with six years of training at Bob Jones University (four full years and two accelerated summer sessions), completing requirements for the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degree.\nReading at a rate of seven hundred words per minute, Dr. Ruckman had managed to read about 6,500 books before receiving his doctorate, and he still reads an average of a book each day.\nDr. Ruckman stands for the absolute authority of the Authorized Version and offers no apology to any recognized scholar anywhere for his stand. In addition to preaching the gospel and teaching the Bible, Dr. Ruckman has produced a comprehensive collection of apologetic and polemic literature and resources supporting the authority of the Authorized Version of the Holy Scriptures.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d934cd59ba338119535fa3bd13ff237d47943e96","amp;dn":"1+in+23%2C000%2C000+-+Dr.+Peter+S.+Ruckman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d934cd59ba338119535fa3bd13ff237d47943e96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,52,205,89,186,51,129,25,83,95,163,189,19,255,35,125,71,148,62,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
