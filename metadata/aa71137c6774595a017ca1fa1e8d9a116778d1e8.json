Please seed, Sharing is Caring.\n\nWhile most of this was mastered to sound completely perfect, some songs were edited to fill in the censored lyrics, so don't complain about a few of the songs not sounding right.\n\nSynopsis:\nEminem has been a controversial figure since he first became big in the rap industry. Touching many taboo and difficult topics, offending many people of different views, religions, etc... Due to this, many of his lyrics were censored, even on the explicit version of the album.\n\nThen there were rumors of a &quot;secret&quot; album called &quot;The Shady Shizzle Collection&quot;, that was supposed to have all of these lyrics uncensored. Until today (August 27th, 2014) that was a rumor. Since no one else had it or tried to &quot;create&quot; it, me and two other people decided to do it together and give it to you for free.\n\nTracklist:\n01.
