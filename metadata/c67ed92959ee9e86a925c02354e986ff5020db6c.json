For Mass, Earth is millennia in the past.\nHis companions are equally diverse, differently evolved, and most unsuitable to him and to one another. Each live on a separate plane they had grown on separate worlds.\nYet survival might depend on communication. To live, they must find a way to come together as they're faced with intense pressure, clashing perspectives, and unfamiliar circumstances.\nIn the waning days of the empire, advanced spaceships were invented which could travel across the empire at shocking speeds. GerroldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s description of the skimmer is fascinating (a spherical field surrounds a constantly modulating Ã¢â‚¬â€ on command of the pilot Ã¢â‚¬â€ interior):\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A core of silvery shimmering vanes, flashing all colors, diamond-bright; they reached outward in all directions, some farther than others, but almost all ended in planes set at odd angled, no two the same. There were suggestions of platforms and hints of terraces, stanchionlike shapes arced smoothly across from one vane to another. On one of them, he thought he recognized curving steps, but they were upside-down.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nDavid Gerrold is famous for his story which was turned into the Star Trek: Original Series episode, The Trouble with Tribbles.
