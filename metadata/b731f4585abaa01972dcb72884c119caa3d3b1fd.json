From them, more complex transactions are derived, and these constitute a realm of business that few people find easily accessible.\n\nFeaturing more than 800 entries, the two-volume Encyclopedia of American Business, Revised Edition is an up-to-date, easy-to-use guide to the nuts and bolts of business jargon. Difficult ideas are explained in straightforward language to help non-specialists, students, and general readers understand the complex and sometimes confusing concepts and terms that are used in business. Five general areas of business are covered: accounting, banking, finance, marketing, and management. This encyclopedia focuses on the terms, concepts, and associations that one is most likely to encounter in business, making it a great place to start learning about how businesses operate and what the primary and different features of specific business-related functions or ideas mean.\n\nEntries include:\n\n-Brain drain \n-Carbon tax \n-Credit default swaps \n-Deleveraging \n-Fair housing laws \n-Investment fraud \n-Micro lending \n-Social media \n-Subprime lending \n-Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP). \n\nRecommended for Grades 9 and up.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b731f4585abaa01972dcb72884c119caa3d3b1fd","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+American+Business+%282+Vol.+Set%29+%5BRevised+Edition%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b731f4585abaa01972dcb72884c119caa3d3b1fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,49,244,88,90,186,160,25,114,220,183,40,132,193,25,202,163,211,177,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
