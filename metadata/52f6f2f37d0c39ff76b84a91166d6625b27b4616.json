This is sourced from a direct A/D transfer of the original 4LP record set provided to the radio stations for the broadcast which we all know. The song transitions are great...that's what I first noticed. The sound is amazingly good. I have &quot;La Villa Strangiato&quot; from Flood Records, and I thought that this had a slightly warmer sound to it. I just loooove that warm analogue sound!! This show is only available through trading. Please do not pay money for this show. There are traders who would be glad to provide you with a copy via a trade.    (2001-05-30)\n\nDionysus 10\n   (Audio - 10)\n\nAn EX+ sounding show from the Permanent Waves Tour. As Marc said above you gotta love that warm analog sound. This show hardly ever leaves my cd player that's how good this show sounds. Listen folks if your trying to deside which St. Louis show to get look no further this is the one to have. Trust me this show will not disapoint.    (2001-07-04)\n\nSean Highkin\n   (Audio - 10)\n\nWOW...YOU NEED TO GET THIS SHOW NOW!!! May be the best sounding Rush boot EVER! Great setlist, perfect sound. GET IT BY ANY MEANS POSSIBLE!!!   (2004-10-20)\n\nJesse G.\n   (Audio - 10)\n\nIf you don't have this one already- GET IT! You're missing out, if you don't have this recording. The boys are on fire this night, and the sound is amazing. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!   (2005-10-02)\n\nBig Hath\n   (Audio - 10)\n\nWow!! First Rush boot I ever heard! I am now spoiled. The sound is incredible and rivals the sound of the official live releases (maybe better?). For me, this is the defenitive Permanent Waves boot.   (2006-02-02)\n\nJon Bernreuter\n   (Audio - 10)\n\nI believe this is the best live document of Rush I have heard, official or otherwise. The sound quality is amazing, and the band gives a full-on performance as well.
