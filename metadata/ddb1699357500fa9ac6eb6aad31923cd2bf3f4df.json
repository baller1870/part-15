Primarily aimed at advanced undergraduate and graduate students in optics, optoelectronics, applied physics, and electrical and electronic engineering, this book serves as a valuable reference for scientists and engineers working in optoelectronics and related fields in industry and academic. Topics include coupling, devices based on coupling effect with non-polarized light, devices using polarized light, devices based on nonlinearities, and devices based on rare earth doped fibers.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddb1699357500fa9ac6eb6aad31923cd2bf3f4df","amp;dn":"Optical+Fibre+Devices","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddb1699357500fa9ac6eb6aad31923cd2bf3f4df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,177,105,147,87,80,15,169,172,110,182,170,211,25,35,205,43,243,244,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
