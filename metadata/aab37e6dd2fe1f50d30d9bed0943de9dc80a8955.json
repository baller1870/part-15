Raising money to help relieve famine in Africa, the greatest comic book writers (including CHRIS CLAREMONT, STAN LEE, ALAN MOORE, DENNY O'NEIL, JIM SHOOTER, and JIM STARLIN) and artists (including BRENT ANDERSON, BRIAN BOLLAND, JOHN BOLTON, JOHN BUSCEMA, JOHN BYRNE, FRANK MILLER, JOHN ROMITA JR., CHARLES VESS, and BERNIE WRIGHTSON) were joined by novelists HARLAN ELLISON, STEPHEN KING, and GEORGE R.R. MARTIN in a jam-session for the ages.\n\nNow honestly, I can tell you that this isn't the best X-Men story. It isn't even the best X-Men story of 1985 (that's probably UNCANNY #198) ... but ...\n\n48 pages plus covers, no ads, at least $500,000 U.S. dollars raised for charity! (Adjusted for inflation, that's almost $1.1 million in 2012 dollars.)\n\nFor the record, I don't think this special is available in any Marvel or X-Men torrent on TPB. All credit to the original scanner, and I hope to see a nice re-scan in the future. This is a comic that deserves it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aab37e6dd2fe1f50d30d9bed0943de9dc80a8955","amp;dn":"X-Men+Heroes+For+Hope+%281985%29+Stephen+King+George+R.R.+Martin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aab37e6dd2fe1f50d30d9bed0943de9dc80a8955","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,179,126,109,210,254,31,80,211,13,155,237,9,67,222,157,200,10,137,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
