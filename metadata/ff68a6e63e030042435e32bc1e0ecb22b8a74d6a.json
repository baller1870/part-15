The version that is slightly altered appeared on Vangelis' Odyssey: The \n\nDefinitive Collection CD.  I would appreciate some feedback as to which version you \n\nthink sounds better.  During the instrumental section in the middle of the song on\n\nthe altered version you can hear an instrument that sounds a lot like a cowbell.  \n\nThis sound does not exist on the original recording.  Also, there are additional \n\nsynthesizer sounds used during the beginning.  Again, please enjoy and please leave \n\nsome comments.  Which version do you like more?  Which has the best audio quality?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff68a6e63e030042435e32bc1e0ecb22b8a74d6a","amp;dn":"Jon+and+Vangelis+-+I%5C%27ll+Find+My+Way+Home+-+Lossless","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff68a6e63e030042435e32bc1e0ecb22b8a74d6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,104,166,230,62,3,0,66,67,94,50,188,30,14,203,34,184,167,77,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
