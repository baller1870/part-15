The train is attacked by Indians and Harvey, hoping to persuade Aguila, the chief, to call off the attack due to Harvey's having saved his son's life, leaves the train to negotiate. He is captured and the rest of the train is wiped out except for two sisters. Escaping and showing up in town later, Harvey is nearly hanged as a deserter, but gets away. Eventually caught by the sheriff and his posse, they are attacked by Indians. This time the Indians are defeated and Aguila, captured and dying, reveals the identity of the white man who engineered the initial attack on the wagon train, just as the perpetrator rides up behind them. \n\nUser Review\n\nI feel the Summary misses the real point. True Jim Harvey has to right a wrong against him, but when making his getaway he is given what he thinks is a broken down nag. Tumbleweed turns out to be anything but broken down. The horse steals the movie and saves the hero over and over. It really seemed the plot of the movie was there just to show off the ability of Tumbleweed. As Nick Buckley tells him &quot;I told you it was the best horse I have&quot;. I hope to get a copy of this movie just to show it to my grand kids so they can see a great example of not judging someone just by looks.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50a4476a95b78422345c483dcb60dffcbf7dff20","amp;dn":"Tumbleweed+%28Western%29+%7BMurphy%2C+Van+Cleff%7D+%5B1953%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50a4476a95b78422345c483dcb60dffcbf7dff20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,164,71,106,149,183,132,34,52,92,72,61,203,96,223,252,191,125,255,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
