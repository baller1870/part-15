Over weary wastes of jungle the drums bring you a story of Africa, that land of mystery and strange ritual, ebony bodies, witch doctors and sudden death. The land of jungle and impenetrable swamp where the primeval sweat of mother earth rises in miasmic clouds of fever-ridden vapour to hang suspended in the foliage of the ageless guardians of the jungle . . . .\n\nMoon Over Africa was originally broadcast in 1935 and was written by Talbot Mundy whose Jimgrim novels are said to have been one of the inspirations for Indiana Jones. Mundy also gave us The Ghost Corps and beginning in the spring of 1936 he became the scriptwriter for radio's Jack Armstrong: The All-American Boy. Talbot Mundy was a disciple of Madame Blavatsky's so you can expect some Theosophical beliefs and theories to crop up quite often. Talbot's best book of the type was arguably Om: The Secret Of Ahbor Valley.\n\n\n\nSearching for a lost tribe spoken of by the natives as the Golden Race Professor Anton Edwards together with his daughter Lorna and his assistant Jack Martin and Umguru a huge native prince are in the wilds of French Equatorial Africa. The Professor has come in to possession of a preserved human head that talks. He believes it to hold the secret of Lost Atlantis.\n\n\n\nNot much is known about the radio series Moon Over Africa, but it was a syndicated 15-minute serial, possibly from South Africa. It's unknown if the series was broadcast in the United States.\n\n\n\nmp3 files, in 26 parts, total running time 05h05m09s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:799d329f743c0756c75a4fafa768f43e17e6c688","amp;dn":"Moon+Over+Africa+%5BSouth+Africa+Radio+adventure%5D+OTR+1935","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"799d329f743c0756c75a4fafa768f43e17e6c688","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,157,50,159,116,60,7,86,199,90,79,175,167,104,244,62,23,230,198,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
