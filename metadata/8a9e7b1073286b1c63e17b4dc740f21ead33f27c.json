This guide provides teachers with practical applications of the principles and theories that are elaborated in A Guide to Effective Instruction in Mathematics, Kindergarten to Grade 6, 2006.\n\nThe guide comprises the following volumes:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Volume 1: The Big Ideas\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Volume 2: Addition and Subtraction\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Volume 3: Multiplication\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Volume 4: Division\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Volume 5: Fractions\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Volume 6: Decimal Numbers\n\nThis first volume of the guide provides a detailed discussion of the five Ã¢â‚¬Å“big ideasÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, or major mathematical themes, in Number Sense and Numeration. The guide emphasizes the importance of focusing on the big ideas in mathematical instruction to achieve the goal of helping students gain a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts.\nVolumes 2 to 6 of the guide focus on the important curriculum topics of addition and subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, and decimal numbers, respectively. Each of these volumes provides:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ a description of the characteristics of junior learners and the implications those characteristics have for instruction;\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ a discussion of mathematical models and instructional strategies that have proved effective in helping students understand the mathematical concepts related to the topic;\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ sample learning activities, for Grades 4, 5, and 6, that illustrate how a learning activity can be designed to:\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ focus on an important curriculum topic;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ involve students in applying the seven mathematical processes described in the mathematics curriculum document;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ develop understanding of the big ideas in Number Sense and Numeration.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a9e7b1073286b1c63e17b4dc740f21ead33f27c","amp;dn":"Number+Sense+and+Numeration+%28Grade+4+to+6%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a9e7b1073286b1c63e17b4dc740f21ead33f27c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,158,123,16,115,40,107,28,99,225,123,77,199,64,242,30,173,51,242,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
