Johnny Panic And The Bible Of Dreams\n\n\n1999 re-released version of the Tears For Fears 1989 masterpiece, with four extra tracks that are worth the effort. Truly representing a wide range of styles starting with the smooth ballad &quot;Woman in Chains&quot; featuring the soulful voice of Oleta Adams. The highlights are the following two tracks: &quot;Badman's Song&quot;, a bluesy jazz number and &quot;Sowing the Seeds of Love&quot; the hit single inspired by the Beatles better work. The track &quot;Year of the Knife&quot; is a powerful rock and roll song. &quot;Famous Last Words&quot; and &quot;Advice for the Young At Heart&quot; round out the single releases. Both are great songs.\nThe extra tracks include a jazz instrumental, and a couple of unique blends of late 80's pop, including a rap version with the &quot;Sowing the Seeds&quot; lyrics called &quot;Johnny Panic&quot;.
