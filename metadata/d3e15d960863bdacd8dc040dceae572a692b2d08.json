At the same time we find out that Hank Mcoy is a local high school football hero, and Warren wants to use his wings to help fight crime.\n\nUnfortunately the tide has turned against mutant kind and the Angel finds himself up against a mutant killing robot, who during a chase ends up crumpling mysteriously.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3e15d960863bdacd8dc040dceae572a692b2d08","amp;dn":"X-Men+-+Curse+of+the+Mutants+-+Smoke+%26amp%3B+Blood+-+Storm+%26amp%3B+G","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3e15d960863bdacd8dc040dceae572a692b2d08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,225,93,150,8,99,189,172,216,220,4,13,206,174,87,42,105,43,45,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
