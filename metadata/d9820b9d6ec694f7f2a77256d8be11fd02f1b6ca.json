Audio is 5.1 surround. Be careful not to turn your subwoofer up too loud, if you have one. Subwoofer levels are higher than common with this disc! But the disc plays equally well or better without the subwoofer, I find.\n\nWith DTS discs, you will need a dts decoder to play it, for example built-in  in your reciever or in your dvd player. Be sure to use a digital output from the player to the reciever if you use the amplifier&amp;#039;s decoder, or else all you will hear is awful noise.\n\nCovers are included as bitmaps for best effect (they were difficult to scan in my poor scanner to good results), but no glasses come with the torrent!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9820b9d6ec694f7f2a77256d8be11fd02f1b6ca","amp;dn":"%28dts%29+Alan+Parsons+Project+-+Stereotomy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9820b9d6ec694f7f2a77256d8be11fd02f1b6ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,130,11,157,110,198,148,247,242,167,114,86,216,190,17,253,2,241,182,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
