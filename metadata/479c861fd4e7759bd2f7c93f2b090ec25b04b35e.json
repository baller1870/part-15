The movie is of the old-school nomadic, skate-everything-in-your-path genre with interludes of stopping to rip-up a big ramp, pool or kicker. After much searching and skateboarding, they locate a large ramp in the desert. They also find a Chinese character on the inside of the ramp's spine. They conclude that in searching for Mr. Chin, they may have found his spirit.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Search_for_Animal_Chin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Search_for_Animal_Chin&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis is the download offered at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://animalchin.com/?awesm=animalch.in_n0I&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://animalchin.com/?awesm=animalch.in_n0I&lt;/a&gt;\n...which was downloading slowly.
