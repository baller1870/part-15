This collection of 19 Streisand duets chronicles collaborations with Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland at one end of the scale and Don Johnson at the other. It finds the singer dabbling--if, as her bluesy miscue with Ray Charles on &quot;Crying Time&quot; argues, not necessarily triumphing--in styles she largely eschewed elsewhere in her career. Still, her unlikely collaborations with Barry Gibb (&quot;Guilty,&quot; &quot;What Kind of Fool&quot;) and Donna Summer (&quot;No More Tears (Enough Is Enough&quot;) during the disco era scored her some of the biggest successes of her career, ample proof that with the right chemistry, Streisand could be as powerful a pop music chameleon as she was a diva. New recordings with veteran Barry Manilow (the warm, low-key &quot;I Won't Be the One to Let You Go&quot;) and Josh Groban (David Foster's overwrought &quot;All I Know of Love&quot;) supplement recordings that stretch from the '60s kitsch-a-go-go of Harold Arlen's &quot;Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead&quot; across five decades of Streisand's unparalleled career.\n\nWilliam Ruhlmann, All Music Guide - In her lengthy career, Barbra Streisand has never shown much inclination to share the spotlight. In the movies, she must endure a leading man, but in her recordings, she has gone it alone for the most part. In 1978, however, a disc jockey edited together her and Neil Diamond's recordings of &quot;You Don't Bring Me Flowers,&quot; and she and Diamond quickly cut a real duet, resulting in a number one hit. Thereafter, she cannily coaxed others into sharing the microphone, resulting in chart singles with Donna Summer, Barry Gibb, Kim Carnes, former boyfriend Don Johnson, Bryan Adams, and Celine Dion, and album tracks with Johnny Mathis, Michael Crawford, and Vince Gill. The material mostly consisted of mediocre adult contemporary ballads that were outshone by the star power of the singers. This album collects all those duets, plus a couple of newly recorded mediocre adult contemporary ballads sung with Barry Manilow and Josh Groban, and a few stray tracks from the 1960s and early '70s when Streisand joined another singer. Her unsuitability to the duet format is repeatedly evidenced, as she seems virtually incapable of shutting up when her partner is trying to take a solo, invariably humming in the background to draw attention back to herself. The only real exception to this rule is the version of &quot;I've Got a Crush on You&quot; recorded for Frank Sinatra's own Duets album, a track Streisand did not control. Naturally, the best performances occur when she is paired with a singer who is more than just a cipher -- Sinatra, Ray Charles, or Judy Garland, the latter two in TV performances. Then, of course, there's the medley of &quot;One Less Bell to Answer&quot; and &quot;A House Is Not a Home&quot; on which she finally finds the perfect duet partner, her overdubbed self! \n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] I Won't Be The One To Let Go      \tBarbra Streisand &amp; Barry Manilow\n[02] Guilty                               \tBarbra Streisand &amp; Barry Gibb\n[03] You Don't Bring Me Flowers         \tNeil Diamond &amp; Barbra Streisand\n[04] I Finally Found Someone            \tBarbra Streisand &amp; Bryan Adams\n[05] Cryin Time                       \tRay Charles &amp; Barbra Streisand\n[06] I've Got A Crush On You         \tBarbra Streisand &amp; Frank Sinatra\n[07] Tell Him                        \tBarbra Streisand &amp; Celine Dion\n[08] No More Tears                    \tDonna Summer &amp; Barbra Streisand\n[09] What Kind Of Fool               \tBarbra Streisand &amp; Barry Gibb\n[10] I Have A Love / One Hand One Heart\tBarbra Streisand &amp; Johnny Mathis\n[11] One Less Bell To Answer          \tBarbra Streisand\n[12] Lost Inside Of You                  \tBarbra Streisand &amp; Kris Kristofferson\n[13] Till I Loved You                     \tBarbra Streisand &amp; Don Johnson\n[14] Make No Mistake, He's Mine         \tBarbra Streisand &amp; Kim Carnes\n[15] If You Ever Leave Me               \tBarbra Streisand &amp; Vince Gill\n[16] The Music Of The Night           \tBarbra Streisand &amp; Michael Crawford\n[17] Ding-Dong!
