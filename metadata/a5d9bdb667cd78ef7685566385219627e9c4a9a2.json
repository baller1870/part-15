But one of them is ready to get her game on somewhere else...\n\nCharlie Castle is an expert archer and a fierce warrior - in her favorite video game, anyway. But college life was a program she couldn't quite master. To land a cybertech job without a degree, she's entering a &quot;hackfest&quot; over spring break - where she also hopes to meet the sweet gamer who's been flirting with her online. Instead, she runs into the hot guy who walked away years ago, and can't fight the desire that comes rushing back.\n\nJonah Best has never gotten over Charlie, whose kisses were always as deliciously creative as her coding. But now that they're face to face again, he doesn't know how to admit that her online admirer is really him - or how to convince her that he's offering her a job for her incredible skills, not her sex appeal. Can Jonah cut through their communication glitches and persuade Charlie that the next level up for them should be forever?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5d9bdb667cd78ef7685566385219627e9c4a9a2","amp;dn":"Her+Perfect+Game+%28Shannyn+Schroeder%29+Retail+azw3+epub+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5d9bdb667cd78ef7685566385219627e9c4a9a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,217,189,182,103,205,120,239,118,133,86,99,133,33,150,39,233,196,169,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
