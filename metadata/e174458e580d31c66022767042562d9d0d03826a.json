Nieuwstadt et al. (Springer, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-3-319-31597-3\r\n\r\nThis book provides a general introduction to the topic of turbulent flows. Apart from classical topics in turbulence, attention is also paid to modern topics. After studying this work, the reader will have the basic knowledge to follow current topics on turbulence in scientific literature. The theory is illustrated with a number of examples of applications, such as closure models, numerical simulations and turbulent diffusion, and experimental findings. The work also contains a number of illustrative exercises","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e174458e580d31c66022767042562d9d0d03826a","amp;dn":"Turbulence+-+Introduction+to+Theory+and+Applications+of+Turbulen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e174458e580d31c66022767042562d9d0d03826a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,116,69,142,88,13,49,198,96,34,118,112,66,86,45,157,13,3,130,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
