When he was not yet 21, he was approached by local record producer Frank Guida to join his tiny Legrand label. Guida changed Anderson's name to U.S. Bonds, hoping the first release would get extra airplay by disc jockeys mistaking it for a public-service announcement. The result was the classic &quot;New Orleans,&quot; combining rock-combo raunch with impassioned, scorched soul-singing that set the stage for all that would follow. Guida double- and triple-tracked Bonds' voice and the resulting murky production gave all the hits (including &quot;Quarter to Three,&quot; &quot;School Is Out,&quot; and &quot;Dear Lady Twist&quot;) a party-in-outer-space quality all their own. Though he kept recording, making a couple of excellent solo albums in the early '80s with the help of Bruce Springsteen, Bonds is best seen today dotting the landscape of oldies shows the world over, singing the songs that made him famous.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nSource:\t\t\tWeb\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.New Orleans\n02.Not Me\n03.Shine On Lover's Moon\n04.Quarter To Three\n05.School Is Out\n06.School Is In\n07.Dear Lady Twist\n08.Havin' So Much Fun\n09.Twist, Twist SeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ora\n10.Seven Day Weekend\n11.Gettin' A Groove\n12.Copycat\n13.I Dig This Station\n14.Where Did The Naughty Little Girl Go\n15.I Wanta Holler (But The Town's Too Small)\n16.Take Me Back To New Orleans\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1d305d24e67551acc6159771020b04f8a3e1daa","amp;dn":"Gary+%5C%22U.S.%5C%22+Bonds+-+Very+Best+Of+%281998%29+%5B320%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1d305d24e67551acc6159771020b04f8a3e1daa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,211,5,210,78,103,85,26,204,97,89,119,16,32,176,79,138,62,29,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
