While the band was on tour, Roddick and James grew increasingly inspired by the sounds of contemporary R&amp;B and wanted to make music reflecting that. Their first song, &quot;Ungirthed,&quot; arrived in January 2011 to critical acclaim, and Purity Ring eventually signed with 4AD Records. Shrines, the duo's debut album, was released in July 2012.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d74eb807ef1af7ca4fbe941a72e04ab4e55df3f2","amp;dn":"Purity+Ring+-+Shrines+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d74eb807ef1af7ca4fbe941a72e04ab4e55df3f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,78,184,7,239,26,247,202,79,190,148,26,114,224,74,180,229,93,243,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
