Drawing on \n\nnumerous unpublished sources, he examines in detail the peculiar friendship between the Oxford mathematician Charles Dodgson (Lewis \n\nCarroll) and Alice Liddell, the child for whom he invented the Alice stories, and analyzes how this relationship stirred CarrollÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s \n\nimagination and influenced the creation of Wonderland. It also explains why Alice in Wonderland (1865) and its sequel, Through the \n\nLooking-Glass (1871), took on an unstoppable cultural momentum in the Victorian era and why, a century and a half later, they continue \n\nto enthrall and delight readers of all ages.\nThe Story of Alice reveals Carroll as both an innovator and a stodgy traditionalist, entrenched in habits and routines. He had a keen \n\ndouble interest in keeping things moving and keeping them just as they are. (In Looking-Glass Land, Alice must run faster and faster just \n\nto stay in one place.) Tracing the development of the Alice books from their inception in 1862 to LiddellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death in 1934, Douglas-\n\nFairhurst also provides a keyhole through which to observe a larger, shifting cultural landscape: the birth of photography, changing \n\ndefinitions of childhood, murky questions about sex and sexuality, and the relationship between CarrollÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s books and other works of \n\nVictorian literature.\nIn the stormy transition from the Victorian to the modern era, Douglas-Fairhurst shows, Wonderland became a sheltered world apart, \n\nwhere the line between the actual and the possible was continually blurred.\n\nAbout the Author\nRobert Douglas-Fairhurst is Professor of English Literature and a Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford.\n\nCONTENTS\nPrologue: Snap 1\nBefore Alice 25\nAlice 87\nAfter Alice 203\nEpilogue: Unknown 419\nNotes 429\nAcknowledgements 473\nCredits 476\nIndex 478\n\nNOTE: If you have problem reading this book with Adobe reader, use spme other better PDF reader like Sumatra or Foxit.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s12.postimg.org/8j5ho6brx/The_Story_of_Alice.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s12.postimg.org/8j5ho6brx/The_Story_of_Alice.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:138cc7488e45ff14e1d09cc6bcc1b06734b618ef","amp;dn":"The+Story+of+Alice+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"138cc7488e45ff14e1d09cc6bcc1b06734b618ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,140,199,72,142,69,255,20,225,208,156,198,188,193,176,103,52,182,24,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
