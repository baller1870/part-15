This book is a special tribute to the invaluable contributions of these cinematic visionaries, many of whom are considered among the greatest screenwriters in American film history. \n\nAs Orson Welles once said, &quot;In my opinion, the writer should have the first and last word in filmmaking.&quot; This book allows them to have that exciting opportunity.\n\nSome of the highlights from these interviews include: Betty Comden and Adolph Green's explaining how a nightclub skit became the premise for Singin' in the Rain; Ernest Lehman's description of how, while in conversation with Hitchcock, his unconscious suddenly solved the plot problems in North by Northwest; Carl Gottlieb's remembrance of the terrible pressure involved with writing the script for Jaws while shooting was already underway; and Sylvester Stallone's account of how he received final approval to star in Rocky from studio executives who thought he was just another actor.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c811d2409513b2657fbb428e099428f65ae1f59","amp;dn":"Classic+US+Films-Conversations+With+The+Screenwriters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c811d2409513b2657fbb428e099428f65ae1f59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,129,29,36,9,81,59,38,87,251,180,40,224,153,66,143,101,174,31,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
