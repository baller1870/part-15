He even tries making one of his own. For many the dream of having a bolt hole or a place to escape from their hectic lives can seem unobtainable. Architect George Clarke shows how such big dreams can be achieved in small and affordable places. George meets the creative people who are making homes out of shipping containers, horseboxes and old buses. Others are building tiny huts or incredible treehouses in the middle of the woods. George also undertakes a small-build property project of his own, buying a dilapidated caravan for just Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£300, with the aim of transforming it into a stunning second home for his growing family.\n\n\n\n\n3)  Modules, Beach Hut, and Gypsy Caravans \nGeorge heads to Scotland to meet Julie and George Nicholson, who take an enormous financial risk and commission local designer Sam Booth to build a truly unforgettable, innovative prototype module holiday home. The stakes are high, as the couple have invested their entire savings of Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£30,000 on a design that's never been tested before. George also takes a trip to Bournemouth and meets Andrew and Emma Collett, who decided not to spend money on a honeymoon but bought a six foot by six foot beach hut to transform into a multi-function small space that can accommodate up to six guests for lunch. Hungry to find inspiration for his own small space caravan design, George visits Gemma Doyle who has lovingly restored some gypsy caravans back to their former glory. And on his own build, George tries to come up with an ingenious solution that will sleep his family of five in a space barely big enough for one double bed.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img145.imageshack.us/img145/2430/georgeclarkesamazingspa.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img145.imageshack.us/img145/2430/georgeclarkesamazingspa.jpg&lt;/a&gt; http://img824.imageshack.us/img824/2430/georgeclarkesamazingspa.jpg http://img252.imageshack.us/img252/2430/georgeclarkesamazingspa.jpg http://img534.imageshack.us/img534/2430/georgeclarkesamazingspa.jpg http://img442.imageshack.us/img442/2430/georgeclarkesamazingspa.jpg http://img850.imageshack.us/img850/420/georgeclarkesamazingspak.jpg http://img651.imageshack.us/img651/2430/georgeclarkesamazingspa.jpg http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/2430/georgeclarkesamazingspa.jpg http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/2430/georgeclarkesamazingspa.jpg http://img825.imageshack.us/img825/2430/georgeclarkesamazingspa.jpg http://img22.imageshack.us/img22/2430/georgeclarkesamazingspa.jpg http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/2430/georgeclarkesamazingspa.jpg \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1939 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16.9\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 48.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 6\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information \n * http://www.channel4.com/programmes/george-clarkes-amazing-spaces/4od","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42ded265f85ea90e5e0a794387efde50816abdba","amp;dn":"Ch4.George.Clarkes.Amazing.Spaces.3of6.Modules.Beach.Hut.and.Gyp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42ded265f85ea90e5e0a794387efde50816abdba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,222,210,101,248,94,169,14,94,10,121,67,135,239,222,80,129,106,189,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
