Each volume takes a detailed look at the costume worn by all levels of society and illustrates it with evocative and accurate line drawings and lively colour plates. The eighteenth century is thought by many to be the high-point of costume - an age of elegance and flair. However, like any period of history the picture is not as straight forward as we might like to think. After all, four reigns are covered in this volume - Queen Anne, and the fir st three Georges (up to 1800)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa0addcd519cf90d246acc188ec423fbe9f1ddb4","amp;dn":"Costume+Reference+4+-+18th+Century+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa0addcd519cf90d246acc188ec423fbe9f1ddb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,10,221,205,81,156,249,13,36,106,204,24,142,196,35,251,233,241,221,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
