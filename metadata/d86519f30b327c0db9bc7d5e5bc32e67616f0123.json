Slipping to number 20 this week, here's Lipps, Inc. with 'Funkytown'.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nThe new record holder for most weeks at number one  on the disco chart (nine weeks that is) makes its debut at number 40, &quot;Me Without You&quot; by Andy Gibb.\n\nThe remakes are showing off their re-makeovers. Linda Ronstadt is at number 38 with her remake &quot;I Can't Let Go&quot; (which gives her eleven hit remakes, breaking her tie with Aretha Franklin who has ten).\n\n&quot;Gimme Some Lovin'&quot; (at number 19) by the Blues Brothers was originally just a demo by the Spencer Davis Group, now it's all grown up.\n \n&quot;More Love&quot; (at number 15) by Kim Carnes was originally a hit by Smokey Robinson and the Miracles (Casey plays a portion of the original and you knew that he would).\n\n&quot;One Fine Day&quot; (at number 13) by Carole King was first a number 5 hit in 1963 for the Chiffons. It has been covered by a lot of artists and has appeared in many soundtracks (King co-wrote the song, but was probably waiting to see if the public really liked it).\n\n&quot;Cupid&quot; (at number 4) by the Spinners is actually two songs in one. &quot;Cupid&quot; (a Sam Cooke classic from 1961) and &quot;I've Loved You For A Long Time&quot; written by Michael Zager.\n\nFrom the AT40 Book of Records, Casey tells which song took the most time to climb to its peak position. He says while most songs average 10 weeks, this one took over 7 months to get to number 16.\n\nFinally, Casey remembers the very first country song to hit number one on the pop chart. It was a song against smoking. Then before &quot;Let My Love Open The Door&quot; by Pete Townsend (at number 25), he says this rock legend was told by several doctors to either quit performing or go deaf. Casey says Townsend wore ear plugs for a while and even though his hearing improved, he quit using them and decided not to worry about deafness because rock 'n' roll was more important! But that's not all. In the last hour there is a Long Distance Dedication from a teen who lost hearing in one ear from drug use because she was trying to fit in.\n\nThe moral is; smoking is not good unless you're against it, in which case you will become popular. Deafness caused by drug use done trying to become popular is bad, but self-inflicted deafness is not if you are a rock-star in a band whose name indicates you didn't hear which person I was just talking about!
