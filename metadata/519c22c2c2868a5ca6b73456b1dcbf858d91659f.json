In 1976, he released LEGALIZE IT, still one of the most significant albums in the history of reggae. The title track expresses one of Tosh's many political causes, justifying the legalization of marijuana as a remedy for various medical ailments. &quot;Burial&quot; is one of several tracks that features the talents of the Wailers' stand-out lead guitarist, Al Anderson. Tosh adds his own seasoning to the reggae pot as he incorporates keyboards in &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do&quot; and synthesizers and sound effects on &quot;Igziabeher.&quot; &quot;Ketchy Shuby,&quot; a sing-along about fooling around, features the background vocal talents of Rita Marley, Bunny Wailer, and Judy Mowatt. Tosh's life ended too early, and LEGALIZE IT is the strongest testament to his legacy. Take a listen, and share the spirit of his genius.\nMore info at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Tosh\n\nTracklist:\n01_Legalize It   04:41\n02_Burial   03:55\n03_Whatcha Gonna Do   02:27\n04_No Sympathy   04:35\n05_Why Must I Cry   03:06\n06_Igziabeher (Let Jah Be Praised)   04:36\n07_Ketchy Shuby   04:57\n08_Till Your Well Runs Dry   06:08\n09_Brand New Second Hand   04:04\n10_Ketchy Shuby (instrumental)   03:16*\nRunningtime: 41:49\n*Bonus track on Peter Tosh - Legalize It  vinyl re-release November 2008\n\nLineup:\nPeter Tosh ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar, keyboards, vocals\nAl Anderson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\nAston &quot;Family Man&quot; Barrett ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\nCarlie Barrett ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums\nTyrone &quot;Organ D&quot; Downie ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ keyboards\nDonald Kinsey ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\nRobbie &quot;Ras&quot; Lee ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ harmonica\nRita Marley ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ background vocals\nJudy Mowatt - background vocals\nRobert Shakespeare ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\nBunny Wailer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ background vocals\n\nLegalize It  Lyrics:\nLegalize it, don't criticize it\nLegalize it, yeah, yeah, and i will advertise it\n\nSome call it tampee, tampee\nSome call it the weed\nSome call it marijuana, marijuana\nSome of them call it ganja, ganja\n\nEvery man got to legalize it, and don't criticize it\nLegalize it, yeah, yeah, and i will advertise it\n\nSinger smoke it\nAnd players of instrument too\nLegalize it, yeah, yeah\nThat's the best thing you can do\n\nDoctors smoke it, nurses smoke it\nJudges smoke it, even the lawyers too\n\nSo you've got to legalize it, and don't criticize it\nLegalize it, yeah, yeah, and i will advertise it\n\nIt's good for the flu, a good for asthma\nGood for tuberculosis, even umara composis\n\nGot to legalize it, don't criticize it\nLegalize it, yeah, yeah, and i will advertise it\n\nBird eat it, ants love it\nFowls eat it, goats love to play with it\n\nSo you've got to legalize it, don't criticize it\nLegalize it, yeah, yeah, and i will advertise it\n\nKeep on telling you, legalize it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:519c22c2c2868a5ca6b73456b1dcbf858d91659f","amp;dn":"Peter+Tosh+-+Legalize+It+1976+%5BMp3+VBR+215-229+mbits%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"519c22c2c2868a5ca6b73456b1dcbf858d91659f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,156,34,194,194,134,138,92,166,183,52,86,177,220,191,133,141,145,101,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
