Enterprise Edition\n\nThis is a fanedit of the Star Trek Enterprise episode s4e22: These Are the Voyages... The key change with this fanedit is the removal of *ALL* images and dialogue of Riker and Troi and any Next Generation set shots. It was appalling to have them show up in the Enterprise finale and the flashback story had no momentum. So the Demons/Terra Prime 2 parter ends up being a much better finale and These Are the Voyages... becomes the worst last episode in Star Trek history. For this fanedit, great effort was put into making the transitions smooth but the viewer will notice some cuts, audio fades, missing dialogue, video cropping and video cross-fades. The best thing about These Are the Voyages... is Jeffrey Combs who once again guest stars as Shran. Plus, removing the Next Gen parts does improve the Enterprise story and let some good moments through.\n\nFinal Edit: Handbrake RF=19\n26m19s 1280x720 25fps AVC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0d45646a654d413e233c&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; 2614Kbps, 5.1 48KHz AC3 384Kbps\n\nRunning times:\n40m28s original, not including credits\n16m12s time removed, mostly Riker and Troi, some Next Gen set shots without them and a little bit of Enterprise footage with Riker in the background\n24m16s fanedit, not including credits\n\nChanges:\n* Removed most of the breaks and fades for commercials except for right after Trip's death (which is strangely short at a mere 1/2 second)\n* Raised the volume 4db with no clipping since the source was very quiet\n* Moved the opening credits to the very start\n* Changed the opening music to the instrumental &quot;Archer's Theme&quot; instead of the original &quot;Faith of the Heart&quot; which has lyrics\n* Removed all images and sounds of Riker and Troi and any set shots from Next Generation; Riker is on the bridge in some scenes but you don't see his face, just his back\n* Completely removed every scene with Riker as Chef\n\nNotes:\n* There is a small overlay logo in the lower right, it's not very obtrusive like some logos. Nothing can be done for this until the Blu-Ray comes. Tricks to mask logos usually make it more noticeable.\n* Big thanks to reliant1 for the 720p 5.1 capture of s4e22.\n* The source video looks good but is not the best so please be patient if the 720p quality isn't the greatest. Once the Blu-Ray is available a pristine fanedit can be done.\n\nIf you like this release, please check out other bsg4you fan edits:\n\nIn.A.Mirror.Darkly.Complete\ntor https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8070922/\n\nDemons.TerraPrime.Movie\ntor https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8078753/\n\nBoomer.and.Chief.v01\nnfo https://www.nzbindex.com/nfo/79725874/\ntor https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7915602/\n\nAthena.and.Helo.v2\nnfo https://www.nzbindex.com/nfo/76097569/\ntor https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7807568/\n\nOther edits: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/bsg4you/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/bsg4you/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThanks! bsg4you\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07703225d33c5f849787673b24a8138584319ce3","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+Enterprise+fanedit+s4e22+These+Are+The+Voyages+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07703225d33c5f849787673b24a8138584319ce3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,112,50,37,211,60,95,132,151,135,103,59,36,168,19,133,132,49,156,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
