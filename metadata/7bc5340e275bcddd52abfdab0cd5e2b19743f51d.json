Fueled by liquor, sex, and violence, this is the real wild west, unlike anything portrayed in the dime novels that first told its story.\n\nGenre: Mystery","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bc5340e275bcddd52abfdab0cd5e2b19743f51d","amp;dn":"Deadwood+by+Pete+Dexter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bc5340e275bcddd52abfdab0cd5e2b19743f51d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,197,52,14,39,91,205,221,82,171,253,171,12,213,226,177,151,67,245,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
