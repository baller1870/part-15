Carlisle gained worldwide fame as the lead vocalist of The Go-Go's, who made history as the first all-female music group to write their own songs and play their own instruments to top the Billboard charts. The Go-Go's are considered by some to be the most successful all-female band of all time.[1] As part of the Go-Go's, Carlisle sold more than seven million albums,[2] and later went on to a successful solo career that spawned hits such as &quot;Mad About You,&quot; &quot;Summer Rain,&quot; &quot;I Get Weak,&quot; &quot;Leave a Light On&quot; and &quot;Heaven Is a Place on Earth&quot;, which topped the charts internationally, including in the United States and United Kingdom. Her autobiography, Lips Unsealed, released in June of 2010, reached #27 on the New York Times Bestseller List and received favorable reviews","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f61ebbd0f496c412e119fd6442b6ce984c65e193","amp;dn":"Belinda+Carlisle+-+7+album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f61ebbd0f496c412e119fd6442b6ce984c65e193","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,30,187,208,244,150,196,18,225,25,253,100,66,182,206,152,76,101,225,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
