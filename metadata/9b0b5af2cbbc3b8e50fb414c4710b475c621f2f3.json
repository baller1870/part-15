Taught by Emmy Award-winning biology teacher George Wolfe, it has the rigor necessary for a general biology course for biology majors. In fact, because it so clearly communicates even complicated topics, it is often used in introductory college biology courses, as well. Using Thinkwell's Biology as a study aid makes sure you'll be prepared to get the most out of your biology class. And it's better than a tutor because it's available 24/7 for one fixed price, instead of by the hour.\n\nThe topic coverage is very similar to high school biology, which makes this an excellent study aid for college prep or for biology homework help.\n\nOur complete Biology package includes:\n- Printed Notes (optional) are the Biology course notes from the Online Subscription, but in a printed, on-the-go format\n- CD Set (optional) contains all of the video lessons so that you can watch them when you're away from the internet.\n\nFeatures:\n- More than 380 video lessons\n- 1000+ interactive bio exercises with immediate feedback allow you to track your progress\n- Practice tests and final tests for all 14 chapters, as well as a midterm and a final\n- Interactive animations with audio\n- Printable illustrated notes for each topic\n\nISBN-10: 096783578X\nPlatform:      Windows, Mac, Linux, Unix\nMedia: Software\nSource:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thinkwell.com/student/product/biology&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thinkwell.com/student/product/biology&lt;/a&gt;\n\nadd those trackers to your torrent client to speed downloading: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=J2nhfYPb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=J2nhfYPb&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b0b5af2cbbc3b8e50fb414c4710b475c621f2f3","amp;dn":"Thinkwell+Biology+%5BRiddleR.TK%5D+%28eLearning%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b0b5af2cbbc3b8e50fb414c4710b475c621f2f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,11,90,242,203,188,59,142,80,251,65,76,71,16,180,117,198,33,242,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
