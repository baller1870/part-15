And that's about all anyone can say with certainty about a conflict that has cost 7,000 American lives and almost $2 trillion. As long as the most basic strategic questions--Who is the enemy? Why are we fighting?--remain unanswered, victory is impossible. Yet this war is eminently winnable if we remove our ideological blinders, accurately name our enemy, and draw up a strategy to defeat him. So says Dr. Sebastian Gorka, one of the most experienced and sought-after authorities on counterterrorism. Our enemy is not &quot;terror&quot; or &quot;violent extremism.&quot; Our enemy is the global jihadi movement, a modern totalitarian ideology rooted in the doctrines and martial history of Islam. Taking his cue from the formerly top-secret analyses that shaped the U.S. response to the communist threat, Dr. Gorka has produced a compelling profile of the jihadi movement--its mind and motivation--and a plan to defeat it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d813489b1875bb26628dee248edd399f92d5a77","amp;dn":"Defeating+Jihad+-+The+Winnable+War+%282016%29+%28Pdf%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d813489b1875bb26628dee248edd399f92d5a77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,129,52,137,177,135,91,178,102,40,222,226,72,237,211,153,249,45,90,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
