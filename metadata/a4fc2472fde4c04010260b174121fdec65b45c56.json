There are no murders, but he does uncover some extraordinary real-life dramas - including the time Hitler accepted the French surrender in one of its carriages. The art deco glory of the train shines through in this sumptuous film, which passes through breathtaking scenery on the journey to Prague and Venice. Plus David finally realises a schoolboy dream and actually drives the train.\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 5000 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1440x810\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 47mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.81 GB\nSubtitles: none\nSource: DVB-S (ITV HD)\n\nXvid also available at MVGroup\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4fc2472fde4c04010260b174121fdec65b45c56","amp;dn":"ITV+David+Suchet+on+the+Orient+Express+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4fc2472fde4c04010260b174121fdec65b45c56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,252,36,114,253,228,192,64,16,38,11,23,65,33,253,236,101,180,92,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
