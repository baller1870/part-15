They allow you to reuse pieces of artwork and update all the instances where youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve used it all at once. And, as Justin Seeley explains, they also happen to reduce your documentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s file size. Follow along with Justin in this course as he shows you how to create your own symbols, save them to libraries, and make changes to symbols and their instances. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn to scale, nest, resize, colorize, and even randomize the symbols in your documents. Plus, get three different practical uses for symbols: a simulated Ã¢â‚¬Å“master pageÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ like youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d find in Adobe InDesign, a product mockup, and a website prototype.\n\nTopics include:\n\n    What are symbols?\n    Creating your own symbols\n    Saving and loading symbol libraries\n    Modifying registration points\n    Working with nested symbols\n    Using 9-slice scaling\n    Resizing symbols in a set\n    Adjusting symbol transparency\n    Mapping symbols to artwork\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2325a51b8afdfb13676e409454757c88e17fd14c","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+-+Using+Symbols+in+Illustrator","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2325a51b8afdfb13676e409454757c88e17fd14c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,37,165,27,138,253,251,19,103,110,64,148,84,117,124,136,225,127,209,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
