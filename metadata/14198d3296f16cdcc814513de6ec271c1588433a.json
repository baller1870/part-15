The authors cover not only the most popular methods for the fabrication of microchips (photolithography, laser ablation, and soft lithography), but also microfluidic techniques for such bioanalytical assays and bioprocesses as DNA analysis, PCR, immunoassays, and cell reactors. Highlights include PCR on a microchip, microscale cell culturing, and the study of cellular processes on a microchip. The protocols offer step-by-step laboratory instructions, an introduction outlining the principles behind the technique, lists of the necessary equipment and reagents, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14198d3296f16cdcc814513de6ec271c1588433a","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2005%5D+Microfluidic+Techniques+Reviews+And+Protocols+%28Meth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14198d3296f16cdcc814513de6ec271c1588433a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,25,141,50,150,241,108,220,200,20,81,61,230,236,39,28,21,136,67,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
