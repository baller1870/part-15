It was written and illustrated by Evan Dorkin and continued from the end of the second Bill &amp; Ted movie Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey.  \n\nThe first two issues concerns efforts by Bill and Ted to create yet another party with old friends celebrating their recent nuptials.  Unfortunately the personification of mortality, Death, a more recent ally, becomes vastly out of sorts and steals the phone-booth time machine.  Rufus, their old guide, helps by directing them to a prototype for the phone booth/time machine.  Bill and Ted must take the device and find Death before he causes too much damage to the time stream.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:088a9b72f255158e422e38a04a05ac89bae129f1","amp;dn":"Bill+%26+Ted%5C%27s+Excellent+Comic+Book","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"088a9b72f255158e422e38a04a05ac89bae129f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,138,155,114,242,85,21,142,66,46,56,160,74,5,172,137,186,225,41,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
