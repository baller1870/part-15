Peter feels this is the perfect time to speak with Jack and Tim alone. And Ty realizes he is still not over the effects of the plane crash he and Scott were in.\n\nDeep in the woods, Tim chooses a great fishing spot on a recommendation from Stumpy, who he says swore on his good leg that it would be teaming with rainbow trout.\n\nFour guys fishing and bonding in the woods. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nMeanwhile back at Heartland, Lou has the dude ranch &quot;picture perfect&quot; for a photographer from Land and Country Magazine, and she is dogsitting Max while Peter is away fishing.\n\nAmy and Mallory find their friendship developing and Caleb and Ashley have a first official date.\n\nMore is revealed than anyone expects in this Sunday's episode. As Jack says, &quot;Fly fishing isn't really about catching fish.&quot;\n\n\nThe resolution is 608x352 and the quality is fairly watchable in my opinion. This episode aired on CBC on Jan 10, 2010. According to the CBC website, the next 3 new episodes will air consecutively each Sunday (from Jan 17 to Jan 31, 2009). \n\nFor more Heartland info, see http://www.cbc.ca/heartland/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62f3f72cc5c5100a13d055cee7e02b6f33b823fb","amp;dn":"Heartland.S03E11.Catch.and.Release.WS.XviD-err0001.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62f3f72cc5c5100a13d055cee7e02b6f33b823fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,243,247,44,197,197,16,10,19,208,85,206,231,224,43,111,51,184,35,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
