Bodmer gets a new assistant to help him corner unsuitable applicants. Very soon, a couple of conformist German physicians, a pretty Eastern European dancer, and the inevitable (and politically troublesome) Italian immigrant and his family start shooting themselves in the foot in their attempts to get the red passport with a white cross.\n\nDirector: Rolf Lyssy\nWriters: Rolf Lyssy, Christa Maerker\nStars: Emil Steinberger, Walo LÃƒÂ¼ÃƒÂ¶nd and Beatrice Kessler\n\nVideo: libx264 688x560 1200kb/s (avconv medium preset)\nAudio: MP3 VBR 2ch 48kb/s (avconv -q5 from AC3 source)\nSubtitles: Vobsub (sub/idx)\nAudio Languages: Swiss German/German/French/Italian\nSubtitle Languages: German/French/Italian/English/Spanish\n\nCinematic Trailer attached at end in Swiss German/German languages\n\n(Note: I re-uploaded due to request for french and italian audio tracks.  They are included, but there are 2 short scenes which are in the German version but are cut out of the FR/IT version, and therefore there is silence on the FR/IT audio during these two scenes.  FR/IT subtitles will still show during these scenes so it is not a big problem.)\n\nNote: This was muxed with MKV header compression disabled for device compatibility.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ce6ecda9ae2696592cb837dbfb74afa4edc0be2","amp;dn":"Die+Schweizermacher+%28The+Swissmakers%29+1979+MKV+All+Langs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ce6ecda9ae2696592cb837dbfb74afa4edc0be2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,230,236,218,154,226,105,101,146,203,131,125,191,183,74,250,78,220,11,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
