This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. Some are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nIsaac Hayes and the Jackson 5 both have the same song in the countdown.\n\nCasey remembers the #1 song from 5 years earlier by the recording act that sold an average of one million records every week for seven years.\n\nThe biggest male solo act in pop music ever to come out of England has a song in this countdown.\n\nTwo listeners ask the same question, &quot;What re\ncord stayed in the number one position for the most consecutive weeks?&quot; This hit recorded by The Weavers in 1950 held the top spot for 13 weeks.\n\n40:    Toast And Marmalade For Tea - Tin Tin\n39:    Reach Out I'll Be There - Diana Ross\n38:    (For God's Sake) Give More Power To The People - Chi-Lites        \n37:    Puppet Man - Tom Jones     \n36:    The Drum - Bobby Sherman     \n35:    Lowdown - Chicago    \n34:    Albert Flasher - The Guess Who   \n33:    Never Can Say Goodbye - Isaac Hayes\n32:    Woodstock - Matthews' Southern Comfort\n31:    That's The Way I've Always Heard It Should Be - Carly Simon\n30:    Don't Pull Your Love - Hamilton, Joe Frank &amp; Reynolds\n29:    Cool Aid - Paul Humphrey &amp; His Cool Aid Chemists    \nSpecial: Paperback Writer - The Beatles\n28:    I Don't Know How To Love Him - Yvonne Elliman\n27:    She's Not Just Another Woman - 8th Day\n26:    Funky Nassau (Part 1) - The Beginning Of The End\n25:    If - Bread\n24:    Put Your Hand In The Hand - Ocean\n23:    Right On The Tip Of My Tongue - Brenda &amp; The Tabulations\n22:    Here Comes The Sun - Richie Havens\n21:    Love Her Madly - The Doors\n20:    Chick-A-Boom - Daddy Dewdrop\n19:    Nathan Jones - The Supremes\nSpecial: Moody River - Pat Boone\n18:    When You're Hot, You're Hot - Jerry Reid\n17:    Don't Knock My Love (Part 1) - Wilson Pickett\n16:    Double Lovin' - The Osmonds\n15:    Superster - Murray Head With The Trinidad Singers\n14:    Never Can Say Goodbye - Jackson 5\n13:    I Don't Know How To Love Him - Helen Reddy\n12:    Me And You And A Dog Named Boo - Lobo\n11:    Indian Reservation - The Raiders\n10:    Bridge Over Troubled Water - Aretha Franklin  \nSpecial: The Wayward Wind - Gogi Grant\n9:    I'll Meet You Halfway - The Partridge Family\n8:    Treat Her Like A Lady - Cornelius Brothers &amp; Sister Rose\n7:    Sweet And Innocent - Donny Osmond\n6:    It's Too Late - Carole King\n5:    Joy To The World - Three Dog Night\n4:    It Don't Come Easy - Ringo Starr\n3:    Rainy Days And Mondays - The Carpenters\n2:    Brown Sugar - The Rolling Stones\n1:    Want Ads - The Honey Cone\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea7b8803b57696ba1342909ddfb3327fd7855825","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1971_June_12th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea7b8803b57696ba1342909ddfb3327fd7855825","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,123,136,3,181,118,150,186,19,66,144,157,223,179,50,127,215,133,88,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
