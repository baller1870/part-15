This film was about the vulnerability of peoples&amp;#039; hearts. It was hard to believe that Kevin James could play in a convincing role, that Will Smith could satisfy without action, and that such a hackneyed genre of film could succeed in such a way. I don&amp;#039;t intend to sound overly endeared with this film - it wasn&amp;#039;t &quot;groundbreaking&quot; in any sort of way - but it was a film worth seeing. Was it believable? No. New York couldn&amp;#039;t be so simple and there has been no human being in the history of mankind that has the &quot;hutzpah&quot; of Hitch. Sure, there are bar-studs, but not ones that can get any chick, at any time - excluding those raking in seven figures, of course. The thing that worked best for this film was its true focus on the dramatic side of things, not just on the comedy. It was a funny two hours, no doubt. But it was also two hours that made you sit in your seat, become immersed in the characters, and smile.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0da021fcc6def61e3ca6ae03401f91f2548047db","amp;dn":"Hitch+%28Will+Smith+-+English%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0da021fcc6def61e3ca6ae03401f91f2548047db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,160,33,252,198,222,246,30,60,166,174,3,64,31,145,242,84,128,71,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
