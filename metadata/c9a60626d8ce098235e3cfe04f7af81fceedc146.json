The book first covers immediate needs like starting a fire, erecting temporary shelter, and finding food. Then it goes beyond other survival books by explaining advanced techniques for long-term living in the wild -- using only those things found in nature. The authors show how to make tools by chipping stones, fashion a bow-and-arrow out of tree branches, weave baskets, fire primitive pots, build a semi-permanent shelter, and even tan hides. Finally, the authors explain how to bring all these skills together to live in the wilderness for days, weeks, months, or even years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9a60626d8ce098235e3cfe04f7af81fceedc146","amp;dn":"Ultimate+Guide+to+Wilderness+Living+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9a60626d8ce098235e3cfe04f7af81fceedc146","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,166,6,38,216,206,9,130,53,227,207,224,79,122,248,31,206,237,193,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
