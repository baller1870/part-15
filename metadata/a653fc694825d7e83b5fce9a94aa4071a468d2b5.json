Bear Family's first Freddie King box was one of our best-selling, best-reviewed sets EVER! This is the exciting sequel. Contains King's acclaimed 'Burglar' album, produced in England by Mike Vernon, as well as rarities and an unreleased version of 'That's All Right'. Most of the riveting live performances on this immense box are previously unreleased, and all are beautifully recorded in crisp, clear stereo. No bootleg quality sound here! Beautifully designed accompanying book features plenty of photos, a full discography, and extensive liner notes that include fresh interviews with Mike Vernon, trumpeter Darrell Leonard (who produced six of the live tracks), and one of Freddie's notable '70s sidemen, pianist David Maxwell. -- This 5-CD boxed set picks up right where Bear Family's first mammoth and highly acclaimed Freddie King box, 'Taking Care Of Business 1956-1973', left off, chronicling the last years of the great Texas-born blues guitarist's legacy with RSO Records, where, of course, Eric Clapton also recorded. King's producer, Mike Vernon, had previously founded Blue Horizon Records, England's top blues label. Vernon would helm King's first RSO album, 'Burglar,' in Great Britain; the set spotlighted Freddie's high-energy attack in a funky soul-laced setting. One song on the acclaimed album was cut in Miami with Tom Dowd producing and Eric Clapton on second guitar. Also included are several more studio-cut gems, including a previously unreleased version of Jimmy Rogers' 'That's All Right', and King's last Vernon-helmed single for RSO, done in L.A. with the city's top R&amp;B session aces. - The other four discs capture Freddie in all his onstage glory, working his magic in front of appreciative live throngs. The great majority of these in-concert performances have never been released until now; they're all professionally recorded in sparkling stereo with Freddie's crack touring band in tow and King in typically dazzling form. The last live number dates from a month-and-a-half before Freddie's tragic December 1976 death, featuring him in a guitar-wielding guest role as Clapton sings Farther Up The Road.\n\nAllmusic review:\nOne of the few ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“60s blues stars who saw an escalation of his fame in the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“70s, Freddie King signed to RSO Records partially on the backing of Eric Clapton, a longtime advocate and fan who continued his support by taking him out on tour. Bear Family's five-disc 2010 set, Texas Flyer: 1974-1976, documents in detail the three years when King flirted with mainstream success, navigating a pleasing middle ground between soul, funk, and the Texas blues that had been his bread and butter. Each of these sounds was evident on his 1974 album Burglar, the LP that would wind up as his last major session. While the record definitely displays the funk of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“70s -- the clavinet makes it unshakable -- King is comfortable in these surroundings, powering through the polyester grooves with his full-bodied vocals and guitar. On the live recordings -- and thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a considerable amount on this set, with everything from track seven on CD 2 on being devoted to concert performances -- KingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s twin strengths overshadow any period affectations and are certainly the reasons any hardcore fans should invest in this set; after all, it pretty much consists of nothing but live performances, which is by no means a bad thing since King is at his purest on-stage. Given the compact span of time these five discs cover, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not the sense of progression present on Bear Family's previous box TakinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Care of Business, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a deep and rich examination of FreddieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s last act, filled with gutsy, powerful blues, the kind that transcends any wide-collar, paisley fashion.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a653fc694825d7e83b5fce9a94aa4071a468d2b5","amp;dn":"Freddie+King+-+Texas+Flyer%3A+1974-1976+%5B2010%5D+%5BAnthology%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a653fc694825d7e83b5fce9a94aa4071a468d2b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,83,252,105,72,37,215,232,59,95,206,154,148,170,64,113,164,104,210,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
