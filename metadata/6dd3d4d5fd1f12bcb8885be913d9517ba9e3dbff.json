Spine-tingling moments alternate with edge-of-your-seat action in Van RooyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Monty Haaviko crime thriller novels. This third instalment in the Monty Haaviko series takes a darker tone from the previous two episodes, An Ordinary Decent Criminal (ODC), and Your Friendly Neighbourhood Criminal (YFNC). \n\nA sophisticated, multi-layered plot keeps pages turning and readers hooked. This time, Monty is tangled in political intrigue, blackmail, corruption, and a long-standing feud in which he becomes a pawn. At the same time, a serial killer threatens the love of MontyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life - his wife Claire, and soon, escape seems impossible. Monty is approached by a wealthy businessman to run for an elected position on the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new Police Commission. \n\nAs an ex-con, this is something Monty finds intensely amusing. However, he soon discovers his backer has a long-standing rivalry with another businessman who is backing his own patsy for the Commission, and who stands to gain a fortune if his man wins. When Claire starts getting mysterious gifts and flowers, Monty learns about a serial killer the police have been tracking unsuccessfully for many years. \n\nHe is torn between leaving town and giving up the Police Commission, or staying and risking ClaireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life. But the killer is one who, once he sets his sights on his victims, will stop at nothing to make them his.\n\nGenre: Mystery/Thriller","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dd3d4d5fd1f12bcb8885be913d9517ba9e3dbff","amp;dn":"A+Criminal+to+Remember+by+Michael+Van+Rooy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dd3d4d5fd1f12bcb8885be913d9517ba9e3dbff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,211,212,213,253,31,18,188,184,136,91,233,19,217,81,123,169,227,219,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
