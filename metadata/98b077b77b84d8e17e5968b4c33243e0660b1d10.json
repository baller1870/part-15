She knows their anguishÃ¢â‚¬â€her own \nbeloved daughter, Bonnie, was taken from her when \nBonnie was just seven years old.  It is only \nrecently that this mystery was resolved and Eve \ncould begin her journey to peace.  Now, Jim Doane \nwants the same kind of answers that Eve always \nlonged for.  His twenty-five-year old son may or \nmay not be dead and he has only burned skull \nfragments as possible evidence.  But he cannot go \nto the police for answers without risking his own \nsecrets and dark past, so instead he chooses a bold \nstep to find the truthÃ¢â‚¬â€a truth that takes Eve down \na twisted path of madness and evil and into the \ndarkest heart of her own history.  Doane needs Eve \nDuncanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s skills and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll do anything to get them. \n\nEven if it means taking Eve. \n\n\n \nTaking Eve (Eve Duncan #16)\nBy Iris Johansen    \nLanguage: EN\nPages: EPUB 488","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98b077b77b84d8e17e5968b4c33243e0660b1d10","amp;dn":"Taking+Eve+%28Eve+Duncan+%2316%29++by+Iris+Johansen+EPUB+EN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98b077b77b84d8e17e5968b4c33243e0660b1d10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,176,119,183,123,132,216,225,126,89,104,180,195,50,67,224,102,11,29,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
