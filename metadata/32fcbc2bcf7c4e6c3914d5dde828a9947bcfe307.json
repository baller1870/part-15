Their delightfully dour little pop songs do touch on the melancholic side of things, but the lyrics are wonderfully slice-of-life descriptions. Singer/lyricist Gary Lightbody gives a shout-out to Sufjan Stevens when on the punchy &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; he sings, &quot;The anger swells in my guts.&quot; Perhaps a better comparison would be American indie-rock act Sebadoh? Regardless, this band continues to surprise. If you went to see this mixed Scottish/Irish group on tour after hearing their wistful, breakout third album Final Straw, you might have been a bit confused by the rock juggernaut confronting you. Eyes Open is their most straightforwardly rock record yet, and thanks in large part to producer Garret Lee, it&amp;#039;s their best. If there was ever perfect music to get lost to while driving around confused about a relationship, this is it. --Mike McGonigal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32fcbc2bcf7c4e6c3914d5dde828a9947bcfe307","amp;dn":"Snow+Patrol+-+Eyes+Open+%5B2006%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32fcbc2bcf7c4e6c3914d5dde828a9947bcfe307","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,252,188,43,207,124,78,108,57,20,213,221,232,40,169,148,123,207,227,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
