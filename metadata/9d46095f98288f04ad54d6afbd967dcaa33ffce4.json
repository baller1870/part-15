Through the life and            \n  convictions of this notorious activist, Trish Dolman crafts an epic   \n  tale of the birth of the modern environmental movement, and the       \n  founding of Greenpeace and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society.     \n  Part high-octane adventure, the film follows Watson and his crew as   \n  they hunt down a Japanese whaling fleet in the vast expanse and       \n  stunning beauty of Antarcticas Southern Ocean, and seamlessly        \n  segues in and out of a wealth of archival footage from decades of     \n  confrontational activism around the world. In-depth interviews with   \n  Watson, Bob Hunter, Patrick Moore and Farley Mowat, among others,     \n  capture the heroics, the ego, the disputed tactics and the urgency    \n  of Watsons mission.                                                  \n                                                                        \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1794779/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1794779/&lt;/a&gt;                                  \n                                                                        \n \n\n  WE'RE LOOKiNG FOR \n                                                   \n                                                                        \n  * Broadcast/Network/PPV TV Cappers with English PDTV/HDTV sources     \n     located in the US/UK/AU/CA/EU                                      \n  * People with PDTV/HDTV sources with an interest in capping           \n  * Pre-retail/unreleased DVD Suppliers (especially sports)             \n  * 100mbit+ affil sites with archives                                  \n                                                                        \n   Find us or email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;3443005257465143745359555d581a575b59&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; if you can help                   \n                                                                        \n \n\n  GREETZ \n                                                              \n                                                                        \n   To all W4F/CLASSiCW4F members, both past and present. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d46095f98288f04ad54d6afbd967dcaa33ffce4","amp;dn":"Eco.Pirate.The.Story.of.Paul.Watson.WS.PDTV.XviD-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d46095f98288f04ad54d6afbd967dcaa33ffce4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,70,9,95,152,40,143,4,173,84,214,175,189,150,125,202,163,63,252,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
