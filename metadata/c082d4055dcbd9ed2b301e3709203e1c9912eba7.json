Were leaders in Britain and France so scarred by the carnage of World War I that they failed to stand up to Hitler as he began his march through Europe, thus providing the spark that would become World War II? Was Czechoslovakia abandoned by Britain and France, sacrificed in the face of Hitler's aggression? In The Road to War, acclaimed historians Richard Overy and Andrew Wheatcroft cogently piece together a globe fractured by war to show how conditions such as the lack of sophisticated intelligence-gathering techniques, limited communication, and events in the USSR and the Far East all conspired to forge a world of shifting alliances, and difficult decisions\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0524mrd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0524mrd&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408418/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408418/&lt;/a&gt;\n \n \n\n============= What's In This Torrent =============\n\n\n\nThe Road To War - 7 Episodes\n\n\nFrom the BBC Website\n\nEpisode 4: Italy\nPlease note that Episode 4: Italy will not be broadcast or made available on BBC iPlayer as part of the current rebroadcasts of The Road to War. \n\n\n===================== General =====================\nComplete name               : The Road To War.avi\nFormat                      : AVI\nFormat info                 : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                   : 500 MB\nDuration (ms)               : 49mn 25s\nTotal bitrate               : 1 414 Kbps\nEncoded application         : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nEncoded library             : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\n===================== Video =====================\nId                          : 0\nFormat                      : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile              : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings - BVOP      : 1\nFormat settings - QPel      : No\nFormat settings - GMC       : No warppoints\nFormat settings - Matrix    : Custom\nCodec Id                    : XVID\nCodec                       : XviD\nDuration (ms)               : 49mn 25s\nBitrate                     : 1 215 Kbps\nWidth                       : 720 pixels\nHeight                      : 416 pixels\nAspect ratio                : 1.731\nFramerate                   : 25.000 fps\nColorimetry                 : YUV\nColos space                 : 4:2:0\nBit depth                   : 8 bits\nScan type                   : Progressive\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.162\nStream size                 : 430 MB (86%)\nEncoded library             : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nId                          : 1\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFormat version              : Version 1\nFormat profile              : Layer 3\nFormat settings mode        : Joint stereo\nFormat settings mode extens : MS Stereo\nCodec Id                    : 55\nCodec                       : MP3\nDuration (ms)               : 49mn 25s\nBitrate mode                : Constant\nBitrate                     : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nSampling rate               : 48.0 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nStream size                 : 67.9 MB (14%)\nAlignement                  : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave duration         : 80 ms (2.00 video frames)\nInterleave preload          : 504 ms\nEncoded library             : LAME3.98r\nEncoded library settings    : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 18.6 -b 192","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c082d4055dcbd9ed2b301e3709203e1c9912eba7","amp;dn":"The+Road+To+War+-+Documentary+-+Xvid+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c082d4055dcbd9ed2b301e3709203e1c9912eba7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,130,212,5,93,203,217,237,43,48,30,55,9,32,62,28,153,18,235,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
