Do not install it over an existing installation.\n\nThis edition is virus free, but it includes a trainer, which may be detected as virus by some programs, though it would be a false possitive. If you do not believe me, just delete &quot;bintrainer.exe&quot; because it is not needed to play the game.\n\nFor those who might ask: Yes, this is the first Shank, not the sequel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d485514b143739791caf48a2fa0c02dea6d512e","amp;dn":"Shank+1.3+non-Steam+%2AFINAL+EDITION%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d485514b143739791caf48a2fa0c02dea6d512e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,72,85,20,177,67,115,151,145,202,244,138,47,160,192,45,234,109,81,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
