Wizards canceled the Alternity line when it decided to roll out the d20 system. Although Alternity is primarily geared towards space opera (and has two settings to support such play--Star Drive and StarCraft), it can support other subgenres of SF, such as post-apocalyptic (Gamma World), conspiracy a la X-Files (Dark Matter) and parallel Worlds (Tangents).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e862f562e183e79027e3e4578fb99c1eecfd755","amp;dn":"Alternity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e862f562e183e79027e3e4578fb99c1eecfd755","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,134,47,86,46,24,62,121,2,126,62,69,120,251,153,193,238,207,215,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
