Hay and Nicolay were the gatekeepers of the Lincoln legacy. They read poetry and attendeded the theater with the president, commiserated with him over Union army setbacks, and plotted electoral strategy. They were present at every seminal event, from the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation to LincolnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s delivery of the Gettysburg AddressÃ¢â‚¬â€and they wrote about it after his death.\n\nIn their biography of Lincoln, Hay and Nicolay fought to establish LincolnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heroic legacy and to preserve a narrative that saw slaveryÃ¢â‚¬â€not statesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ rightsÃ¢â‚¬â€as the sole cause of the Civil War. As Joshua Zeitz shows, the image of a humble man with uncommon intellect who rose from obscurity to become a storied wartime leader and emancipator is very much their creation.\n\nDrawing on letters, diaries, and memoirs, LincolnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Boys is part political drama and part coming-of-age taleÃ¢â‚¬â€a fascinating story of friendship, politics, war, and the contest over history and remembrance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38bc31d99f9e49c220f38aceee40fbead92aaffc","amp;dn":"Lincoln%27s+Boys+-+Joshua+Zeitz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38bc31d99f9e49c220f38aceee40fbead92aaffc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,188,49,217,159,158,73,194,32,243,138,206,238,64,251,234,217,42,175,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
