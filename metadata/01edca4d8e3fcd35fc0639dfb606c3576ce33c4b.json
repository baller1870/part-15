Their new 'relatives' turn out to be a little more authentically Scottish than they bargained for. Ben Nevis, Laird of Glenbogle Castle, is fiercely protective of his lands and the Macdonald clan spirit, but being cash-strapped he's not above attempts to marry heiress Myrtle to one of his many brawny sons. However, Ben Nevis is distracted when a group of hikers stumble on his moor and spoil a days hunting...sparking all-out war between gentry and commoners.\n\n\nThe author\n\nCompton Mackenzie was born in West Hartlepool in 1883, and educated at St Paul's School and Magdalen College, Oxford.
