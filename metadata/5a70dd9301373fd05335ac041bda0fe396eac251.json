The game features more than 600 cars, 27 tracks, hundreds of challenges, and more depth and replay value than any other racer on the face of planet. The challenges are divided into different racing experiences ranging from arcade to simulation, street to rally racing, and more. The two-disc set offers a straightforward approach in Arcade mode, which provides three different classes of cars to choose from, three levels of difficulty, and either direct competition against the computer or head-to-head play. In Arcade mode, players can simply get right in and race. If you simply want to get used to the game, this mode is for you. You can take part in street races, rally races, check out a cool Replay Theater mode (to watch your own exquisite replays), and race against time in Time Trial, or your own Ghost Car in rally mode.\n\nTested and working on all CFW's 5.00 m33 and above using the 500 popsloader pack set on 3.72 POPS... Like my work?? Please read the NFO and support me ;)\n\nHave you been looking for that classic PSX game but just can't seem to find it anywhere? How about those &quot;rare&quot; titles that were only released in certain regions? Better yet, would you like to be able to have those games playable on your PSP so you can play them anywhere you want?
