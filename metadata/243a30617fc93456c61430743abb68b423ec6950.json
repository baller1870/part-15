And in &amp;#039;&amp;#039;The Uncertainty Principle,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; his eighth movie to be shown in the New York Film Festival, this 93-year-old Portuguese director goes where only a few cult admirers are likely to follow.\n\nThe pivotal character, Camila (Leonor Baldaque), is a proud, idealistic young woman who regularly prays to a statue of Joan of Arc. As her marriage to a childhood friend sours, the movie poses oblique questions about the interplay of morality and intelligence in the development of Western culture.\n\nBased on Augustina Bessa-Luis&amp;#039;s novel &amp;#039;&amp;#039;The Family Jewel,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; &amp;#039;&amp;#039;The Uncertainty Principle&amp;#039;&amp;#039; has a melodramatic plot that sounds much juicier than it plays out on the screen, as the accumulated betrayals and reversals build toward one character&amp;#039;s death by arson in a discothÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨que fire. The story focuses on Camila&amp;#039;s complicated relationships with Antonio (Ivo Canelas) and JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© (Ricardo Trepa), childhood friends from different social classes, who were brought up as brothers.
