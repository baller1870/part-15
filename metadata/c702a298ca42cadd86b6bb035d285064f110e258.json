The duo left Atco in the late '60s, staging a comeback on Kapp/MCA Records in the early '70s, which means latter-day hits such as&quot;All I Ever Need Is You&quot; and &quot;A Cowboy's Work Is Never Done&quot; aren't here, but chances are most listeners won't even notice, since all the big songs are here: &quot;I Got You Babe,&quot; &quot;Laugh at Me,&quot; &quot;Baby Don't Go,&quot; &quot;Just You,&quot; &quot;But You're Mine,&quot; &quot;What Now, My Love?,&quot; &quot;The Revolution Kind,&quot; &quot;Little Man,&quot; and &quot;The Beat Goes On.&quot; True, the collection may run a little long for some tastes, but there's no denying that it has all that a casual or dedicated fan could ever want from a Sonny &amp; Cher compilation.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
