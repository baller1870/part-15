As a member of four Red WingsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Stanley CupÃ¢â‚¬â€œwinning teams, McCarty played the role of enforcer from 1993 to 2004 and returning again in 2008 and 2009. His Ã¢â‚¬Å“Grind LineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with teammates Kris Draper and Kirk Maltby physically overmatched some of the best offensive lines in the NHL, but he was more than just a brawler: his 127 career goals included several of the highlight variety, including an inside-out move against Philadelphia in the clinching game of the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals. As colorful a character as any NHL player, he has arms adorned with tattoos, and he was the lead singer in the hard rock band Grinder during the offseason. Yet this autobiography details what may have endeared him most to his fans: the honest, open way he has dealt with his struggles in life off the ice. Whether dealing with substance abuse, bankruptcy, divorce, or the death of his father, Darren McCarty has always seemed to persevere.\n\n\nFormat - E-Pub\n\nSize   - 43.6 mb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee511c85af32641355fe6b86e74ce24e3a851fb7","amp;dn":"My+Last+Fight%3A+The+True+Story+of+a+Hockey+Rock+Star","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee511c85af32641355fe6b86e74ce24e3a851fb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,81,28,133,175,50,100,19,85,254,107,134,231,76,226,78,58,133,31,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
