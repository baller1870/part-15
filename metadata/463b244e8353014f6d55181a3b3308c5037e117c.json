He argues that humankind is at a turning point in history. In this century, we are going to make the historic transition from the &amp;#039;Age of Discovery&amp;#039; to the &amp;#039;Age of Mastery&amp;#039;, a period in which we will move from being passive observers of nature to its active choreographers. This will give us not only unparalleled possibilities but also great responsibilities.\n\nThe Intelligence Revolution\n\nFirst aired Monday 05 November 2007 21:00-22:00 BBC Four.\n\nIn the opening instalment, Kaku explains how artificial intelligence will revolutionise homes, workplaces and lifestyles, and how virtual worlds will become so realistic that they will rival the physical world. Robots with human-level intelligence may finally become a reality, and in the ultimate stage of mastery, we&amp;#039;ll even be able to merge our minds with machine intelligence.\n\nFor the first time on television, see how a severely depressed patient can be turned into a happy person at the push of a button - all thanks to the cross-pollination of neuroscience and artificial intelligence.\n\n\nTechnical Specs :\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Filesize : 745 MB (for each of 3 parts)\n- Duration : 59 min\n- XviD encoded.\n- Video bitrate : 1638 Kb/s\n- Resoulution : 672 x 384 (16:9)\n- Audio Codec : VBR mp3\n\n- Ripped by : Adam Cook\n\n\n...
