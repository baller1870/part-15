Even for such a skilful sorcerer, modern life is rubbish. \n\nListeners follow the life and times of 2,000-year-old Mordrin, who has been a practising wizard for many centuries. Despite wielding incredible mystical powers, Mordrin's humdrum existence, based in the small Scottish village of Blairochil, is a far cry from the mystical excitement portrayed by the likes of Merlin and Harry Potter.\n\nCast:\nDavid Kay\nJack Docherty\nGordon Kennedy\nCora Bisset\nCallum Cuthbertson\nElenor Thom\nGrant O'Rourke\nSally Reid\nRosemary Hollands\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/mordrin_mcdonald_wizard/episodes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/mordrin_mcdonald_wizard/episodes/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMordrin McDonald 21st-Century Wizard - S01 - E01 - Quest\nMordrin McDonald 21st-Century Wizard - S01 - E02 - Blairochil Business Awards\nMordrin McDonald 21st-Century Wizard - S01 - E03 - Ogre Bin Laden\nMordrin McDonald 21st-Century Wizard - S01 - E04 - Market Magic\n\nMordrin McDonald 21st-Century Wizard - S02 - E01 - Billirock The Black\nMordrin McDonald 21st-Century Wizard - S02 - E02 - The Root Of All Evil\nMordrin McDonald 21st-Century Wizard - S02 - E03 - The Dating Wizard\nMordrin McDonald 21st-Century Wizard - S02 - E04 - Birthday Magic\nMordrin McDonald 21st-Century Wizard - S02 - E05 - Team Building\nMordrin McDonald 21st-Century Wizard - S02 - E06 - Merlin's Visit\n\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration Approx : 13mn 54s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\n[\n\n\nI post quite a few torrents if this site is down when I post a new one I don't have time to keep trying.\nIf it's down then it's skipped.\n\nYou can follow me on Twitter so you don't miss any\n\n\nOr add the RSS feed in uTorrent (In FEEDS on the left add)\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:585ef8dd1dd5e7fd5f5309334cb1a14a8cddd717","amp;dn":"Mordrin+McDonald+21st-Century+Wizard+Quest+-+S01+%26+02+-+Audio+Co","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"585ef8dd1dd5e7fd5f5309334cb1a14a8cddd717","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,94,248,221,29,213,231,253,95,83,9,51,76,177,161,74,140,221,215,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
