We then present a new metric,\nreferred to as the non-uniformity factor, which quantifies the\nunevenness of a vulnerable-host distribution. This metric is\nessentially the Renyi information entropy and better characterizes\nthe non-uniformity of a distribution than the Shannon\nentropy. Next, we analyze the propagation speed of networkaware\nmalwares in view of information theory. In particular, we\ndraw a relationship between Renyi entropies and randomized\nepidemic malware-scanning algorithms.We find that the infection\nrates of malware-scanning methods are characterized by the\nRenyi entropies that relate to the information bits in a nonunform\nvulnerable-host distribution extracted by a randomized\nscanning algorithm. Meanwhile, we show that a representative\nnetwork-aware malware can increase the spreading speed by\nexactly or nearly a non-uniformity factor when compared to\na random-scanning malware at an early stage of malware\npropagation. This quantifies that how much more rapidly the\nInternet can be infected at the early stage when a malware\nexploits an uneven vulnerable-host distribution as a networkwide\nvulnerability. Furthermore, we analyze the effectiveness of\ndefense strategies on the spread of network-aware malwares. Our\nresults demonstrate that counteracting network-aware malwares\nis a significant challenge for the strategies that include host-based\ndefense and IPv6.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d891b15c57beba52ecc6d79fc6f543cf027befa","amp;dn":"Theoretical+View+of+Network-Aware+Malware+Attacks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d891b15c57beba52ecc6d79fc6f543cf027befa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,137,27,21,197,123,235,165,46,204,109,121,252,111,84,60,240,39,190,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
