The music score was by Daniele Amfitheatrof and the cinematography was by Hal Mohr. The film stars Robert Cummings and Susan Hayward with Agnes Moorehead, Joan Lorring, Eduardo Ciannelli and Minerva Urecal.\n\nThe eerie atmosphere in the Venetian home was achieved through &quot;tenebrous lighting, solemn rhythms and emphasis in music and sounds&quot;. Agnes Moorhead's makeover as the 105-year old woman was the subject of magazine articles for months after release. Occasional glimpses of Agnes Moorhead also add to the grotesque.\n\nMOVIE PLOT:-\nA publisher, Lewis Venable, travels from New York to Venice, seeking to buy the 19th Century love letters of the late poet Jeffrey Ashton (whose portrait looks suspiciously like Percy Bysshe Shelley) to a woman named Juliana Bordereau. He learns from a living poet, Charles Russell, that, amazingly, Juliana is still alive at 105.\n\nLewis assumes a false identity, not immediately announcing his intent. He is given lodging by Juliana and meets great-niece Tina, a pianist.\n\nIn time, he discovers that Juliana is in dire need of money, even offering to sell him a valuable painting. He also learns that Tina has a schizophrenic personality, at times deluding herself into believing that she is Juliana, and that Ashton's letters were written to her.\n\nCharles tries to blackmail Lewis, revealing his true identity and purpose. Lewis comes to believe that Ashton was murdered and buried in the garden. Chaos ensues as he begins to leave, the house catching fire. He manages to save Juliana from the blaze, but the precious letters are lost, as is the old woman's will to live.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 3433 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x528\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.212:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  1\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 89 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad DDR   ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:330ce65db95dc56cc29d7e20cfd68b6ea525502a","amp;dn":"The+Lost+Moment+%281947%29+Xvid+1cd+-+Susan+Hayward%2C+Robert+Cummings","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"330ce65db95dc56cc29d7e20cfd68b6ea525502a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,12,230,93,185,93,197,108,194,157,126,32,207,214,139,110,165,37,80,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
