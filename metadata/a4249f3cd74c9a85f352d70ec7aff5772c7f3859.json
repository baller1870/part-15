Yet it's Creel who talks her way out of the dragon's clutches. And it's Creel who walks for days on end to seek her fortune in the king's city with only a bit of embroidery thread and a strange pair of slippers in her possession.\n\nBut even Creel could not have guessed the outcome of this tale. For in a country on the verge of war, Creel unknowingly possesses not just any pair of shoes, but a tool that could be used to save her kingdomÃ¢â‚¬Â¦or destroy it.\n\n\n\nBook 2: Dragon Flight\nWith the Dragon Wars over, Creel finds herself bored with life as a seamstress. Then word comes that a bordering country has been breeding dragons in preparation for an invasion. Never one to sit around, Creel throws herself headlong into an adventure that will reunite her with her dragon friend Shardas, pit her against a vicious new enemy and perhaps rekindle a friendship with Prince Luka that seems to have gone cold. Funny, heart-felt, and action packed, this is a sequel that will satisfy on every level.\n\n\n\nBook 3: Dragon Spear\nFor Creel, all is right with the world. The dragon king, Shardas, and his queen, Velika, have made a comfy home on the Far Isles, and humans and dragons seem to be at peace. It's the perfect time for Creel to plan her wedding to Prince Luka. Well, it was perfect -- until Velika gets kidnapped, and Creel and Luka set off to save her. And if their most dangerous adventure yet wasn't enough to throw off the wedding, a bridal-gown fiasco just might do the trick. Creel wouldn't trade her friendship with the dragons for the world, but doesn't every girl deserve her happily ever after?\n\n\nGenre: Childrens | Adventure | Fantasy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4249f3cd74c9a85f352d70ec7aff5772c7f3859","amp;dn":"Dragon+Slippers+series+-+Jessica+Day+George+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%7B+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4249f3cd74c9a85f352d70ec7aff5772c7f3859","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,36,159,60,215,76,154,133,243,82,215,14,199,175,245,119,44,127,56,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
