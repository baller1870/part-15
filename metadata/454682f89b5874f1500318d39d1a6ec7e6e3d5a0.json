Rashid bin Mohd Yusoff (Wiley-VCH, 2014).pdf\r\n\r\nThis first book on emerging applications for this innovative material gives an up-to-date account of the many opportunities graphene offers high-end optoelectronics. The text focuses on potential as well as already realized applications, discussing metallic and passive components, such as transparent conductors and smart windows, as well as high-frequency devices, spintronics, photonics, and terahertz devices. Also included are sections on the fundamental properties, synthesis, and characterization of graphene.\r\n\r\nWith its unique coverage, this book will be welcomed by materials scientists, solid-state chemists and solid-state physicists alike","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:454682f89b5874f1500318d39d1a6ec7e6e3d5a0","amp;dn":"Graphene+Optoelectronics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"454682f89b5874f1500318d39d1a6ec7e6e3d5a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,70,130,248,155,88,116,241,80,3,24,211,157,26,110,199,230,227,213,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
