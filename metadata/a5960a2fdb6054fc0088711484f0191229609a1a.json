It stars Natasha Leggero and Riki Lindholme as Victorian era heiresses. Shot reality style, the comedy follows the misadventures of NewportÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first family, The Bellacourts, a family with nothing to offer the world, but who have so much money that it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t matter. The show centers around the oldest Bellacourt sisters, Lillian (Leggero) and Beatrice (Lindholme), who care only about how they look, what parties they are invited to and becoming famous, which is a lot harder in 1902.\n\nSeason 01, Episode 01 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“PilotÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe Party of the Century\n\nSource : Another.Period.S01E01.Pilot.1080p.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.H.264-NTb.mkv (837.0 MB)\nStreaming link: uptostream.com/0svhhodbezi0\n\nCRF 24\nHE-AAC 2.0 96 kbps\nSubs\n\nAnother.Period.S01E01.Pilot.720p.Web-DL.AAC.x264-AuP.mkv (210.1 MB)\n\n~20 min\n\n-AuP","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5960a2fdb6054fc0088711484f0191229609a1a","amp;dn":"Another+Period+S01E01+Pilot+720p+Web-DL+AAC+x264-AuP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5960a2fdb6054fc0088711484f0191229609a1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,150,10,47,219,96,84,252,0,136,113,20,132,240,25,18,41,96,154,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
