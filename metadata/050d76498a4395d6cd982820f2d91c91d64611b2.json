The novel begins on opening day of the NFL season, when bullets begin to rain down upon the upper deck of a packed football stadium. A panic stampede ensues, leading to mass casualties. The alleged sniper is found holding a smoking assault rifle, and is killed by a police marksman.\n\nOne week later, congress bans the private possession of all semi-automatic assault rifles. Gun owners are given one week to turn in their semi-automatic rifles, or face a five year mandatory sentence.\n\nThe plot revolves around the true identity of the actual sniper. The alleged sniper killed at the scene may be a patsy, and many Americans refuse to turn in their banned weapons, leading to a civil crisis in the nation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:050d76498a4395d6cd982820f2d91c91d64611b2","amp;dn":"Enemies+Foreign+And+Domestic+-+Matthew++Bracken","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"050d76498a4395d6cd982820f2d91c91d64611b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,13,118,73,138,67,149,214,205,152,40,32,242,217,28,145,214,70,17,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
