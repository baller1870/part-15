The song is a mid-tempo rock ballad song and won Kravitz a Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance in 2001, a feat he had already achieved twice consecutively, with &quot;Fly Away&quot; and &quot;American Woman&quot;. The singer is inspired in a lover that he has lost and doubts if he is going to eventually meet her again.\n\n\n                                   Music video\n\n  &quot;Again&quot;, directed by Paul Hunter, features Kravitz with a girl in his apartment (Gina Gershon), whom he does not seem to be interested in. Similar to the song lyrical content, he meets a girl (Teresa Lourenco), who works as a waitress in a restaurant/diner. At the end of the video, Kravitz goes to the restaurant to meet her again, but she is not there and Kravitz leaves. Soon after he leaves, the waitress enters the restaurant, not realising he was there to see her. Kravitz returns to his apartment, losing the chance to meet her one more time.\n\n   Some other shots of the video show Kravitz performing the song at a club, the Limelight. Other scenes show Kravitz in his apartment, wandering around, taking a shower and watching television.\n\n                                Chart performance\n\n   &quot;Again&quot; is one of Kravitz's most popular songs. On the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, the song peaked at #4, making the single the 2nd most successful song in that country by Kravitz.\n\n\n                                   ***Again.***\n\n\n                                      Enjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4860ae44e58f13e2c1f68860fa5feca3976c864","amp;dn":"Lenny+Kravitz-Again%282000%29%28Promo+Only%29-Wushan.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4860ae44e58f13e2c1f68860fa5feca3976c864","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,134,10,228,78,88,241,62,44,31,104,134,15,165,254,202,57,118,200,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
