Enjoy!\n\n\n\nSLACKSTRING is the perfect moniker for the band; laid back, groovy music providing the soundtrack for summer barbecues and the sport of sunset watching. Comprised of four guys born and raised adjacent to the Pacific Ocean in Manhattan Beach, CA, the sound of SLACKSTRING was crafted as much by the beach lifestyle as it was by local musical influences from classic bands like The Doors and The Beach Boys to neighborhood punk pioneers Pennywise and Descendents. Their sound has been described as Pure Feel-Good Music by L.A. newspaper The Daily Breeze, and a desert island CD by their legions of dedicated fans.\n\nSLACKSTRING was born out of the long term musical relationship of Gavin Heaney and Eric Lyman (songwriters/guitarists/vocalists), and Matt Muir (drums) who have been performing together since their high school days. Add Brett Thomas on bass and the SLACKSTRING sound is complete. \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c682b600f7d27b8c11309964a22c053dedad2f6","amp;dn":"Slackstring","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c682b600f7d27b8c11309964a22c053dedad2f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,104,43,96,15,125,39,184,193,19,9,150,74,34,192,83,222,218,210,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
