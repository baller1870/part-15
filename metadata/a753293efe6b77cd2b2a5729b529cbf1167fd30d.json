Witnessed on numerous occasions throughout the centuries at her historic home, Hever Castle, and the Tower of London, where she was executed; as well as many less familiar places you wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t necessarily expect to find her, Anne BoleynÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ghost is considered to be one of the most frequently seen ghosts in the UK.\nOne day in 2009 a family visited Hever Castle on the 500th anniversary of King Henry the Eighth's Accession to the Throne. \n\nAn outing full of twists and turns, their day at the castle had a few surprises in store for them. As they walked through the castle's ancient rooms one of the family members Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a budding photographer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ unknowingly captured the ghost that has mystified so many individuals since her dramatic, and rather gruesome, end.\n\nIt is Anne Boleyn like you have never seen her before. Her Ghost no longer dwells in the shadows, but has appeared in her full glory in front of one unsuspecting photographer's lens. Almost five hundred years after she was executed at the Tower of London Anne Boleyn appears not a day older than the day she lost her head.\nThis is the story of that family's eventful day at Anne Boleyn's historic home, Hever Castle, and the mysterious photographs they took..\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction/Spirituality","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a753293efe6b77cd2b2a5729b529cbf1167fd30d","amp;dn":"Anne+Boleyn%27s+Ghost+by+Liam+Archer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a753293efe6b77cd2b2a5729b529cbf1167fd30d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,83,41,62,254,107,119,205,43,42,87,41,181,41,203,241,22,127,211,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
