After installation copy\nprecracked exe from the Crack folder to the installed folder of\nCollectorz.com Movie Collector Pro, making sure to overwrite\nthe existing file.  You now have a fully registered version of\nMovie Collector Pro\n\nNOTE TO ALL READ NOW\n\nGoing to ONCE AGAIN state the obvious because some people can't\nseem to use common sense and nuke a working release because of\ntheir stupidity.  So here we go again and state the obvious in\neach release of any Collectorz.com applications\n\nWe have for awhile now made searching at Collectorz.com work and\nnot show illegal key, allowing movie lookup to work from that\nsource, while another group's crack didn't allow ANY searching\nthere at all.  Now of course if you add over the 50 normal limit\nfor Movie Collector, and request data well over that limit from\nthat source in ONE BIG SEARCH, your going to be red flagged and\nthe server WILL block your IP and only your IP and say your\ntrial is up (and this is ONLY for retrieval of updates from\nthem).  This again should be quite obvious with server side\nprotection and using a cracked application, but we give you the\noption to still be able to download from them, nobody else could\nbefore (we won't explain our method\n\nWe will state it again clearly, don't search over that limit in\none large update to your database  Example would be 50 to 75\nback to back automatic searches/updates in one use.  If you do\nhalf of the normal limit (25 searches) and more at a later time,\nyou'll be fine as we have patched the counter inside your\ncollection file.  For people that refuse to listen (like you\nnuker), you have been warned  Change your IP if you somehow\nforget this, or wait for the ban to be lifted if you don't\nlisten (yes using a FREE PROXY allows you once again to search\nright away, showing you its server side).  You still have ALL the\nother Pro features anyways.  Besides, if your using this program\nto store that many Movies, its about time you paid for it and\nmade that purchase to support this great database manager.\n\nThats it  Enjoy\n\nT E  2 0 1 1\n\nascii\nby mx\n\nDon't Hate The Hacker,  Hate The Code","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb1a8a1860adf45c3f31293ca541e2c346c100c8","amp;dn":"Collectorz.com.Movie.Collector.Pro.v7.1.6-TE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb1a8a1860adf45c3f31293ca541e2c346c100c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,26,138,24,96,173,244,92,63,49,41,60,165,65,226,195,70,193,0,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
