It's very interesting to hear the stories of his early years, \ncoming to America, getting involved in weightlifting and amateur wrestling, getting into pro wrestling, \nthen getting blackballed, and his eventual rise to the top. Hulk is quick to take credit to bringing the\nbusiness to a higher level but Bruno counters saying that all those arenas had been selling out\nfor years on a monthly basis before Hogan and there's no way Hogan could draw sellout houses month\nafter month in the same cities. Alot of material is covered during the course of the interview. \n\nDuration: 02:46:00\nContainer: mp4\nResolution: 576x432\nVideo Bitrate: 1100kbps\nAspect Ratio: 4:3\nFrame Rate: 29.97fps\nAudio Format: AAC\nAudio Bitrate: 96kbps\nNo. of Channels: 2ch","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db8f34440623833a3d5469c1a37b7682249b3305","amp;dn":"WWE-RF+Video+Shoot+with+Bruno+Sammartino+DVDRip+x264-NoNeYa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db8f34440623833a3d5469c1a37b7682249b3305","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,143,52,68,6,35,131,58,61,84,105,193,163,123,118,130,36,155,51,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
