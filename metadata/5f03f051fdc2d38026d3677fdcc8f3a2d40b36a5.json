The way Harper sees it, she's providing a service to the dead while bringing some closure to the living-but she's used to most people treating her like a blood-sucking leech. Traveling with her stepbrother Tolliver as her manager and sometime-bodyguard, she's become an expert at getting in, getting paid, and getting out fast. Because for the living it's always urgent-even if the dead can wait forever.\n\nGrave Sight\nGrave Surprise\nIce Cold Grave\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f03f051fdc2d38026d3677fdcc8f3a2d40b36a5","amp;dn":"Charlaine+Harris%5C%27+Harper+Connlley+Series+Books.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f03f051fdc2d38026d3677fdcc8f3a2d40b36a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,3,240,81,253,194,211,128,38,211,103,127,220,200,243,162,212,11,54,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
