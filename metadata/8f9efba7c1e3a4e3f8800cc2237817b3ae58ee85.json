Dunn (Artech House, 2006).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 1580530117\r\n\r\nDue to the increasing complexity of modern electrical, mechanical, and chemical systems, today's engineers have a growing interest in instrumentation, sensors, and process control. Providing this essential knowledge, this clear, easy-to-comprehend resource covers a wide range of technologies and techniques used in process control, fully explaining important related terminology. Professionals learn how to use microprocessors for both analog and digital process control, as well as signal conditioning. Moreover, engineers find the latest details on cutting-edge microelectromechanical devices and smart sensors. The book presents numerous worked examples using both English and SI (international system) units, which allows for easy conversion between the two systems. Nearly 200 illustrations and more than 150 equations support key topics throughout the book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f9efba7c1e3a4e3f8800cc2237817b3ae58ee85","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Instrumentation%2C+Sensors%2C+and+Process+Control","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f9efba7c1e3a4e3f8800cc2237817b3ae58ee85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,158,251,167,193,227,164,227,248,128,12,194,35,120,23,179,174,88,238,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
