Its goal is to find, test, diagnose and repair hard disk drive problems, report and display SSD and HDD health, performance degradations and failures. Hard Disk Sentinel gives complete textual description, tips and displays/reports the most comprehensive information about the hard disks and solid state disks inside the computer and in external enclosures (USB hard disks / e-SATA hard disks). Many different alerts and report options are available to ensure maximum safety of your valuable data.\n\nNo need to use separate tools to verify internal hard disks, external hard disks, SSDs, disks in RAID arrays as these are all included in a single software.\n\nHard Disk Sentinel monitors hard disk drive / HDD status including health, temperature and all S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) values for all hard disks. Also it measures the disk transfer speed in real time which can be used as a benchmark or to detect possible hard disk failures, performance degradations.\n\nHDSentinel is the perfect data protection solution: it can be effectively used to prevent HDD failure and SSD / HDD data loss because it has the most sensitive disk health rating system which is extremely sensitive to disk problems. This way even a small HDD problem can't be missed. The Professional version has scheduled and automatic (on-problem) disk backup options to prevent data loss caused by not only failure but by malware or accidental delete also.\n\nInstallation instructions:\n1. Execute the Hard Disk Sentinel PRO v4.40.9 Build 6431 Beta (2-click run)(Registered).exe file.\n2. Follow the instructions.\n3. Enjoy the program.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00e7d5959beb2740f7de1b6c52352647fac9793c","amp;dn":"Hard+Disk+Sentinel+PRO+v4.40.9+Build+6431+Beta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00e7d5959beb2740f7de1b6c52352647fac9793c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,231,213,149,155,235,39,64,247,222,27,108,82,53,38,71,250,201,121,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
