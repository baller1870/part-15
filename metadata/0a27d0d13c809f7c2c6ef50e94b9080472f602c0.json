Some of them are realy good and others were failed attempts. I would advise trying the Pearl Harbour mission, and the stalingrad mission.\n\nI also created a good dogfight map which i designed to simulate an actual war front with ground battles taking place along the front line and German V2 facilities to attack.\n\n\nInstall instructions:\n\n\nUnzip the rar file using a program like Winrar.\n\nRun IL2-FB.exe and your away.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf your looking for other people to play IL-2 Sturmovik and other games with, then you might want to try this gaming community: UnderCoverNoobs\n\n\nWebsite: www.UnderCoverNoobs.net\n\nVentrilo: IP: change.typefrag.com PORT: 9134\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a27d0d13c809f7c2c6ef50e94b9080472f602c0","amp;dn":"IL-2+Sturmovik+Forgotten+Battles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a27d0d13c809f7c2c6ef50e94b9080472f602c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,39,208,209,60,128,159,124,44,110,245,14,148,185,8,4,114,246,2,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
