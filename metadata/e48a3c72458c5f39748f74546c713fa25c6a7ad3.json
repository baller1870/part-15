Most people (just like me when I started) don't know how to do this. It simply means that when the download is complete, don't press stop or close down your program. It will then be available to anyone who wants to download it from you. Thanks.\n\nSiSoftware Sandra (the System ANalyser, Diagnostic and Reporting Assistant) is an information &amp; diagnostic utility. It should provide most of the information (including undocumented) you need to know about your hardware, software and other devices whether hardware or software.\n\nIt works along the lines of other Windows utilities, however it tries to go beyond them and show you more of what's really going on. Giving the user the ability to draw comparisons at both a high and low-level. \n\nYou can get information about the CPU, chipset, video adapter, ports, printers, sound card, memory, network, Windows internals, AGP, ODBC Connections, USB2, 1394/Firewire, etc.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e48a3c72458c5f39748f74546c713fa25c6a7ad3","amp;dn":"SiSoft+Sandra+Pro+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e48a3c72458c5f39748f74546c713fa25c6a7ad3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,138,60,114,69,140,95,57,116,143,116,84,108,113,63,162,92,106,122,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
