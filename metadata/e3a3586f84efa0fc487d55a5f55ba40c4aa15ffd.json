With trumpeter Harold &quot;Shorty&quot; Baker, trombonist Lawrence Brown, baritonist Harry Carney, pianist Call Cobbs, or Richie Powell, bassist John Williams, drummer Louis Bellson, and either Jimmy Hamilton or John Coltrane (who unfortunately does not solo) on tenor, Hodges had a particularly strong group. High points include &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street,&quot; the title track and a seven-song ballad medley. This session was also included in Mosaic's six-LP Johnny Hodges set. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Used To Be Duke\n02 - On The Sunny Side Of The Street\n03 - Sweet As Bear Meat\n04 - Madam Butterfly\n05 - Warm Walley\n06 - Autumn In New York\n07 - Sweet Lorraine\n08 - Time On My Hands\n09 - Smoke Gets In Your Eyes\n10 - If You Were Mine\n11 - Poor Butterfly\n\nEnjoy and share!
