Features a performance of William Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing at the Globe Theatre in England. Stars Eve Best and Charles Edwards.\n\nMy notes:\n\nHere is another in the series of video releases from the reconstructed Shakespeare's Globe Theater: a replica of the original theatre in which Shakespeare's plays were performed.  As with the other releases no lighting effects, sound enhancements or other 20th Century theatre technique are used on these productions.  The costumes are accurate and the performances are outstanding.\n\nNote how, as in the film &quot;Anonymous&quot; by Roland Emmerich, the actors play directly to the audience.  This for me is very affecting and, unlike present-day 'spectacle productions'\nseen on Broadway stages and then recirculated via small town performing arts centers, the audience is engaged with and by the performers.\n\nThe torrent is given here for those such as myself who will never go to Stratford.  I encourage anyone who can get the dvds for their libraries to do so.  These torrents are merely a way to accomplish having the Stratford productions at the Globe seen by a wider viewing public.  \n\n\n\nNotes written May 15th, 2013\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e7b10e68058222a2e8cd7e3151e9a0c332f44a7","amp;dn":"Shakespeare%27s+Globe+On+Screen+Much+Ado+About+Nothing+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e7b10e68058222a2e8cd7e3151e9a0c332f44a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,123,16,230,128,88,34,42,46,140,215,227,21,30,154,12,51,47,68,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
