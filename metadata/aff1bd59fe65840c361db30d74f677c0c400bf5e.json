Recorded after a year in which he lost several people close to him, the theme of death and dying surfaces on several tracks. His trademark dark humor, however, tempers the sadness and makes &quot;Diamonds And Dust&quot; a unique listening experience. In addition to his originals, Morlix includes a cover of Dylan's &quot;With God On Our Side&quot;, a song as timely today as it was when it was written 44 years ago. This is another unique and brilliant chapter in Morlix's uniquely brilliant career.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aff1bd59fe65840c361db30d74f677c0c400bf5e","amp;dn":"Gurf+Morlix...Diamonds+to+Dust%282007%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aff1bd59fe65840c361db30d74f677c0c400bf5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,241,189,89,254,101,132,12,54,29,179,13,116,246,119,192,196,0,191,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
