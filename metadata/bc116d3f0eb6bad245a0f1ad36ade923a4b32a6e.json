Team Bundi did an excellent piece\nwork on this game, and yet you made the game suffer with the protection\nadded to it. Some people that bought the game, can't even run the game,\nbecause of this clever protection. Protections like this one can get\ntoo clever, that it is the reason for lower framerates, and in the end\nmake the game almost unplayable for others.\n\nImortant:\n\nLatest game update is included with the cracked content\nMake a local profile, by using Rockstar's Social-Club, so you can be\nable to load/save\n\nGREETINGS\n\nTo all friends of the family and honorable rival groups\n\nascii art by the\ngodlike &amp; terrific duo\nmalodix  irokos\ntitan artdivision\n\n\nPoster:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/COJDs.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/COJDs.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc116d3f0eb6bad245a0f1ad36ade923a4b32a6e","amp;dn":"L.A.Noire.DLC.Addon-SKIDROW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc116d3f0eb6bad245a0f1ad36ade923a4b32a6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,17,109,63,14,182,186,210,69,160,241,173,54,173,233,35,164,179,42,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
