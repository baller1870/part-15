The tales range, chronologically, from the writings of her college days and residence in Greenwich Village in the early 1940s, to the unforgettably chilling stories from the period just before her death. They provide an exciting overview of the evolution of her craft through a progression of forms and styles, and add significantly to the body of her published work.\n\n\n\nJust an Ordinary Day is a testament to how large a talent Shirley Jackson had and to the depth, breadth, and complexity of her writing. Though this remarkable literary life was cut short, Jackson clearly established a unique voice that has won a permanent place in the canon of outstanding American literature, and remains a powerful influence on generations of readers and writers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fceb7da316b53d60c7f047e2f5784c0df8a18e49","amp;dn":"Just+An+Ordinary+Day+-+Jackson+Shirley.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fceb7da316b53d60c7f047e2f5784c0df8a18e49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,235,125,163,22,181,61,96,199,240,71,226,245,120,76,13,248,161,142,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
