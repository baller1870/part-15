The final battle killed all the dragons and left nothing but fields of ash. A small clutch of dragon eggs was all that remained to provide hope for the future.\nFive hundred years later, the ability to use magic is a death sentence and dragons are remembered as a curse. But the unhatched dragons sing for their riders...and six lives will be changed forever.\nThe elements of magic are drawn together as the dragons' call leads them on a journey where they learn everything they've been taught to believe about magic and dragons is wrong. With the last of the dragons and the world at stake, they will risk everything to heed the call. But an evil from the past rises again. Shadow Dragons ride the dawn once more...\n\nÃ‚Â©2012 Audra Trosper (P)2013 Audra Trosper","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd1c629ece37a1ee89a6e449a3c89b89cd3d5250","amp;dn":"Embers+at+Galdrilene","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd1c629ece37a1ee89a6e449a3c89b89cd3d5250","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,28,98,158,206,55,161,238,137,166,228,73,163,200,155,137,205,61,82,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
