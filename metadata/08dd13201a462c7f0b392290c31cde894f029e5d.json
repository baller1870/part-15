But that's about all they have in common. Ryan has spent the last decade in China building his career as a documentary photographer. Colin stayed closer to home, in Toronto, and built up his own successful currency trading company, which he recently resigned from. Together they have just completed a 65 day - 18,000km - motorcycle journey around China. They have traveled through some of the country's most populous and remote regions, while at the same time making a documentary film. The purpose of the film is to put China on display. To explore the visual and cultural wonders that is China. With a massive population, crowded cities, abundant minorities and its stunning natural landscape; China offers a traveler an experience like no other. And we're hoping you'll come along for the ride, on one of the world's greatest adventures. Our films title is: &quot;The Middle Kingdom Ride&quot;, as China's historical name was once &quot;The Middle Kingdom&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5)  Mount Everest and Lhasa \r\nA local Zhongba motorcycle repairman comes to the Pyle brother's rescue, managing to get the BMW bike clutch back in working order. But further disaster strikes when Colin's bike blows a tyre. The journey is now in real jeopardy, with both bikes off the road and no clutch parts available in all of China. When the bike part finally arrives from Toronto, and Ryan and Colin make it to Mount Everest Base Camp, 12,500km from Shanghai. Their sense of achievement is fleeting; on their way back to Lhasa, they discover the road into Eastern Tibet has been indefinitely closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e5/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7d/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a1/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/71/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/88/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d8/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cb/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4b/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f6/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a4/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/56/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b5/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b3/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/04/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c4/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b8/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3173 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 24mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 520 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2524222/?ref_=tt_ov_inf \nhttp://www.toughrides.tv/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08dd13201a462c7f0b392290c31cde894f029e5d","amp;dn":"Tough+Rides+China+Series+1+5of6+Mount+Everest+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08dd13201a462c7f0b392290c31cde894f029e5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,221,19,32,26,70,44,127,11,57,34,144,195,28,222,137,79,2,158,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
