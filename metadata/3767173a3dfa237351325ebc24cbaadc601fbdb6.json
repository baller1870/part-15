Originally formed as a Swedish musical duo by Persson and Atomic Swing musician Niclas Frisk, A Camp has since evolved into a trio with the addition of American film composer, Shudder to Think member, and Nina's husband, Nathan Larson. As the title Colonia suggests, the new album is a journey through a myriad of themes, events and ideas which have been prevalent throughout history and remain true today.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3767173a3dfa237351325ebc24cbaadc601fbdb6","amp;dn":"A+Camp+-+Colonia+%5Bmp3-vbr-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3767173a3dfa237351325ebc24cbaadc601fbdb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,103,23,58,61,250,35,115,81,50,94,188,36,203,170,220,96,31,189,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
