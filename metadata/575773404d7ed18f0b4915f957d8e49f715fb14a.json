This book, spanning nearly two centuries, offers an exhilarating tour of the railwaysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ inroads into the economy, society, and culture of North America. \nIllustrated with more than 400 historical and modern photographs and period advertisements, The Complete Book of North American Railroading takes readers back to the birth of the railroads, then travels through the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Golden AgeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from 1900 to 1950 and on to the railways of our day. Locomotives, from steam to electric and diesel; passenger travel; freight operations; and infrastructure, including stations, bridges, depots, roundhouse, railyards, and signaling are all thoroughly examined and amply illustrated. Authors Kevin EuDaly and Mike Schafer delve into the history, the culture, and the technology of the railroads as they have carried travelers across the continent, brought goods to market, connected businesses in peacetime and war, and enriched the canon of American folklore and the quality of everyday life.\n\nPS yes, I love Railway","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:575773404d7ed18f0b4915f957d8e49f715fb14a","amp;dn":"North+American+Railroading+%28Railways+History%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"575773404d7ed18f0b4915f957d8e49f715fb14a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,87,115,64,77,126,209,143,11,73,21,249,87,216,228,159,113,95,177,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
