The album was a serious musical departure for Dylan, who uses a large pop-rock bandÃ¢â‚¬â€complete with female backing vocalistsÃ¢â‚¬â€for the first time.\n\nFollowing the twin successes of Blood on the Tracks and Desire, Street-Legal was another gold record for Dylan, but it peaked at only #11 on the US Billboard charts, making it his first studio album to miss the US Top 10 since 1964. However, it became his best-selling studio album in the UK, reaching #2 on the charts (his highest position in eight years) and achieving platinum status with 300,000 copies sold (the only other Dylan album to do this was The Essential Bob Dylan).\n\nIn 1999, Street-Legal received a special remixing and remastering job from engineer Don DeVito. {DeVito was producer, not the re-mix engineer} The newer version boasted richer sound, correcting numerous issues with the original production. However the original production was reinstated for The Complete Album Collection Vol. One.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Changing of the Guards&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:04\n    &quot;New Pony&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:28\n    &quot;No Time to Think&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8:19\n    &quot;Baby, Stop Crying&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:19\n    &quot;Is Your Love in Vain?&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:30\n    &quot;SeÃƒÂ±or (Tales of Yankee Power)&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:42\n    &quot;True Love Tends to Forget&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:14\n    &quot;We Better Talk This Over&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:04\n    &quot;Where Are You Tonight?
