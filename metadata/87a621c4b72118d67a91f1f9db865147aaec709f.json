His music is often elaborate and complex in nature. He is best known for his hit 1973 album Tubular Bells, which broke new ground as an instrumental concept album, and for his 1983 hit single &quot;Moonlight Shadow&quot;. He is also well known for his hit rendition of the Christmas piece, &quot;In Dulci Jubilo&quot;.\nHaving recorded a demo version of Tubular Bells (I belive that he was 17), Oldfield attempted to convince someone in the music industry to take the project on, but was told the project was unmarketable. However, in 1972 he met the young Richard Branson who was setting up his own record label, Virgin Records, and after playing the demo to engineers Tom Newman and Simon Heyworth, he began recording the 1973 version of the album, whiich brought to Virgin Records as we know it today...And the others were biting their fingernails :-)\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
