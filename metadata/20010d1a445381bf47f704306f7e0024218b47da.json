The name CÃƒÂ©line was the first name of his grandmother. He developed a new style of writing that modernized French literature. \n\nCÃƒÂ©line's best-known work is Voyage au bout de la nuit, translated into English most \nrecently by Ralph Manheim. It violated many of the literary conventions of the time, using the rhythms and, to a certain extent, the vocabulary of slang and vulgar speech in a more consistent and occasionally more difficult way than earlier writers who had made similar attempts (notably Ãƒâ€°mile Zola), in the tradition of FranÃƒÂ§ois Villon. The book became a success, but CÃƒÂ©line was not awarded the Prix Goncourt, despite strong support; the award went to Guy Mazeline's novel Les Loups (The Wolves). The voting was controversial enough to become the subject of a book (Goncourt 32 by EugÃƒÂ¨ne Saccomano, 1999).In 1936 CÃƒÂ©line published Mort ÃƒÂ  crÃƒÂ©dit (Death on the Installment Plan), giving innovative, chaotic, and antiheroic visions of human suffering. Here, he extensively used ellipses scattered throughout the text to enhance the rhythm and to emphasise the style of speech. In both books he showed himself to be a great stylistic innovator and a masterful storyteller. French author Jean-Paul Sartre publicly praised CÃƒÂ©line during this period.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe torrent contains following books, in a mixture of ePUB and Mobi:\n\n* Castle to Castle -- EPUB\n\n* Death on the Installment Plan -- Mobi\n\n* Journey to the End of the Night -- ePUB\n\n* North -- Mobi\n\n* Rigadoon  -- Mobi\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRead the following articles, interviews, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis-Ferdinand_C%C3%A9line&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis-Ferdinand_C%C3%A9line&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4502/the-art-of-fiction-no-33-louis-ferdinand-celine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4502/the-art-of-fiction-no-33-louis-ferdinand-celine&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2013/05/louis-ferdinand-celine-anti-&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2013/05/louis-ferdinand-celine-anti-&lt;/a&gt;\nsemitism.html\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.counter-currents.com/2011/05/remembering-celine/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.counter-currents.com/2011/05/remembering-celine/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20010d1a445381bf47f704306f7e0024218b47da","amp;dn":"Louis+Ferdinand+Celine+-+French+Author+%28+5+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20010d1a445381bf47f704306f7e0024218b47da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,1,13,26,68,83,129,191,71,247,4,48,111,126,0,36,33,139,71,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
