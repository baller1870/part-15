He has said on the networking website Myspace that &quot;The idea back then was to do a thing called Project 56 which was 56 tracks for people with short attention spans. Instead of waiting years to finally throw it together, I figured I'd just toss it to everyone.&quot;[1] This album includes some tracks (be it or not in variant form) and elements that appear on the album Get Scraped.&quot;\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f60c4e1bdb104279581f31421c15a18ffce6ec6a","amp;dn":"deadmau5+Project+56+%282008%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f60c4e1bdb104279581f31421c15a18ffce6ec6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,12,78,27,219,16,66,121,88,31,49,66,28,21,161,143,252,230,236,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
