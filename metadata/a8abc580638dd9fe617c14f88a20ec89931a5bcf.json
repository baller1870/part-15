The rise of the Mongols marked the last major clash between nomadic and sedentary cultures. They united Eurasia in a truly international trading system, encouraged new forms of communication, and demonstrated the value of religious tolerance at a time when religious differences often led to wars. Mongol rule helped unify both Russia and China two of today's most powerful nations. Mongol Empire details how the Mongols were able to sweep so swiftly and effectively across the plains and establish a great empire, and why it was ultimately an empire they could not control. Providing a fascinating look into the daily life of the Mongols, this guide explains what they ate, how they dressed, how they raised their children, and what they believed. Connections in our own world to the Mongols include military tactics that are still used today, words such as &quot;czar and horde&quot;, and the enduring myths of Chinggis and Kublai Khan and Tamerlane, which have fired imaginations for centuries","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8abc580638dd9fe617c14f88a20ec89931a5bcf","amp;dn":"Empire+Of+The+Mongols","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8abc580638dd9fe617c14f88a20ec89931a5bcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,171,197,128,99,141,217,254,97,124,20,248,138,32,236,137,147,26,91,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
