As one of the most influential rock musicians of South America, together with Charly GarcÃƒÂ­a is considered the father of Argentine rock. He was born in Buenos Aires in the residential neighbourhood of Belgrano. During his early childhood he was already listening to all kinds of music: folklore and tango, and a little bit later, rock. In 1967, amidst the repressive political climate, he formed a band called Almendra with his schoolmates.\n\nContrasting with the backwards and authoritarian government of General Juan Carlos OnganÃƒÂ­a, Buenos Aires was undergoing a cultural blossoming based on new art expressions; the new generation, among sons of the middle class, were immersed in an effervescence that would not reappear in Argentina until 1983. Spinetta devoted himself fully to his own music. In his lyrics, there are influences of multiple writers, poets and artists like Arthur Rimbaud, Vincent van Gogh, Carl Jung, Sigmund Freud, Friedrich Nietzsche, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Carlos Castaneda and Antonin Artaud, who has his name in the album Artaud.\n\nOn 23 December 2011 he published on the Twitter account of his son Dante that he was facing lung cancer. He died on February 8, 2012 in his native Argentina, at the age of 62. His ashes were scattered in the waters of the RÃƒÂ­o de la Plata, according to his last wish, next to the Memory Park built to remember the desaparecidos of the National Reorganization Process.\n\nFuego Gris (1993)\n\nFuego Gris (Gray Fire) is a solo album by Luis Alberto Spinetta recorded in 1993 and distributed by the label Interdisc, for the soundtrack Argentina eponymous film, directed by Paul CÃƒÂ©sar.\n\nTracklist\n\nEscape hacia el alma\nYo no puedo dar sombra\nNirvana maÃƒÂ±ana\nVerde bosque\nPreciosa dama azul\nTocando sin sentir\nParado en la sentina\nCadalso temporal\nPenumbra\nFeroz canciÃƒÂ³n\nDedos de mimbre\nTrampaluz\nCaspa tropical\nOh! doctor\nFlecha Zen\nCordÃƒÂ³n de perfume\nNorte de nada\n\nPersonnel\n\nCarlos Alberto &quot;Machi&quot; Rufino: Bass.\nClaudio Cardone: Keyboards.\nJota Morelli: Drums.\nLuis Alberto Spinetta: Guitars, Bass, Programming, Sequencer, Samplings and voice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed844bf8d00755d62cb7496d257e00c64438879d","amp;dn":"Luis+Alberto+Spinetta+-+Fuego+Gris+%281993%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed844bf8d00755d62cb7496d257e00c64438879d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,132,75,248,208,7,85,214,44,183,73,109,37,126,0,198,68,56,135,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
