There she meets the lesbian real estate agent Moira.\n\n\n\nCONTAINER....................: MP4\nCODEC........................: X264\nGENRE........................: Drama\nFILE SIZE....................: 1.52 GB\nRESOLUTION...................: 1920x1080\nBITRATE MODE.................: Variable\nAVG.

The bitrates are high enough to look perfect on &quot;normal&quot; sized monitors and low enough to keep download times short and the file size small enough for those who have limited hard drive space to work with. If you plan on watching something on a large HD screen, you may need one of the larger file size, higher bitrate torrents. The larger the screen you'll be watching on, the higher the bitrate has to be to maintain picture quality. If you have a large screen, you'll need to experiment too see what bitrate it takes to maintain a quality picture for your particular size screen.\n\n(My 1080p encodes will still look crisp and sharp on monitors up to 28-30&quot;, and possibly larger. The above paragraph primarily applies to 720p and below.)\n\nPlease seed as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c40899d4a5d8a06c2540bc0a71ea8b7360fb7af","amp;dn":"Trasgredire+%28Cheeky%29+%282000%29+%5B1080p%5D+x264+-+Jalucian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c40899d4a5d8a06c2540bc0a71ea8b7360fb7af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,64,137,157,74,93,138,6,194,84,11,192,167,30,168,183,54,15,183,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
