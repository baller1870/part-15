I have read and listened to E Raymond Capt's books and video documentaries . They very good, he is a Biblical Archeologist.\nHis research is very simple ti understand, yet thorough. \n\nHe has a very calm demeanor. I mention that because I think that shows in his books.\nHe is a Christian, and I remember this one thing he said;\n\nI saw there was a need to bring these histories to the public, I was just sitting around and wanted to do something for God. \n\nNot exactly as he said it ; but it give some insight into what kind of person he is, and i think this adds to why the books are so well done, in my opinion , in terms of understanding, not complexity, but clear thought. \n\n\nI will be loading more books of his as I find them.  As he is a Biblical Archeologist ; I you will not be wasting your time reading this book.\n\nI'm  all these I upload will be books i think are essential .\n\n  The pyramids a witness to God.
