Jeffes and cellist co-founder Helen Liebmann were the only core members throughout its life; a number of other musicians appeared on the PCO's six studio albums according to the requirements of particular pieces. The PCO also toured extensively during the 80's and early 90's, and two albums, &quot;When in Rome&quot; (1988) and &quot;Concert Program&quot; (1995) captured the sound of the live ensemble. The Penguins' sound is not easily categorized, but has elements of exuberant folk music and a minimalist aesthetic occasionally reminiscent of composers such as Philip Glass.\n\nThe Penguin Cafe Orchestra recorded and performed for 24 years until Jeffes died of a brain tumour in 1997.\n\nReleased 1981\nGenre Instrumental Folk\nLength 48:15\nLabel E.G. Records\nProducer Simon Jeffe\n\nPenguin Cafe Orchestra was the second album by the Penguin Cafe Orchestra, and was recorded at the Penguin Cafe between 1977 and 1980. By this time the line-up for the band had expanded greatly, with contribution including Simon Jeffes, Helen Leibmann, Steve Nye, Gavyn Wright of the original quartet, as well as Geoff Richardson, Peter Veitch, Braco, Giles Leamna, Julio Segovia and Neil Rennie. All pieces were composed by Simon Jeffes except for &quot;Paul's Dance&quot; (Jeffes and Nye), &quot;Cutting Branches&quot; (traditional), and &quot;Walk Don't Run&quot; (by J. Smith).\n\nThis release is widely considered as the critical best produced by the Orchestra, its whimsy and eclecticism making it inherently more approachable than the previous, more serious-minded initial album.\n\nThe cover painting is by Emily Young.\n\nAir ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  Danser - 4:30\nYodel 1 - 4:07\nTelephone and Rubber Band - 2:28\nCutting Branches for a Temporary Shelter - 3:09\nPythagoras's Trousers - 3:18\nNumbers 1-4 - 6:57\nYodel 2 - 4:34\nSalty Bean Fumble - 2:11\nPaul's Dance - 1:45\nThe Ecstasy of Dancing Fleas - 4:01\nWalk Don't Run- 3:01\nFlux - 1:48\nSimon's Dream - 1:48\nHarmonic Necklace - 1:12\nSteady State - 3:33\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:162540cb34f0d0d58476d03505e39cc0ef81453e","amp;dn":"Penguin+Cafe+Orchestra...Penguin+Cafe+Orchestra%281981%29%5BFLAC%5D---DI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"162540cb34f0d0d58476d03505e39cc0ef81453e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,37,64,203,52,240,208,213,132,118,208,53,5,227,156,192,239,129,69,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
