The series features three of the country's finest Chefs: Derry Clarke, Catherine Fulvio and Paul Flynn who are as oddly complimentary as the Top Gear trio, with egos to match.\n\nEach week the Chefs arrive at a Great Irish Country House and must recreate a grand dinner from its history while tantalising the TV audience with sumptuous descriptions of the treats that are on the menu. The meal will be served with all the pomp and ceremony it deserves, to the audible delight of the diners who can't help themselves from gasping at the spectacle as the sumptuous banquet is laid before them.\n\n\n\n\n\nLords &amp; Ladles - Series 1, Episode 1\n\n\nBirr Castle, Co.
