Of course, there is mom and dad who are always fighting, and those annoying neighbors who get to spend the summer at the beach. And then, there's LÃƒÂ©a, the exasperating girl who's always right about everything. In the summer of '68, when mom decides to leave everything behind to start a new life in Greece, LÃƒÂ©on is prepared to do anything to kill the pain. Destroy the neighbors' house, become a professional liar and even, why not, fall in love with LÃƒÂ©a. Together, they will overcome the pain of growing up when you feel abandoned. \n\n\n\nAudio: French\nSubtitles: Portuguese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56c26e56d02f40d7a096134f4d0d6e9bc1e9c280","amp;dn":"It%27s+Not+Me%2C+I+Swear%21+%282008%29+DVDRip+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56c26e56d02f40d7a096134f4d0d6e9bc1e9c280","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,194,110,86,208,47,64,215,160,150,19,79,77,13,110,155,193,233,194,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
