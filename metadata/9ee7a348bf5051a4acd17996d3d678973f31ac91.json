Smither's gravelly, instantly recognizable voice is a perfect fit for his pensive, sharply honed lyrics and his blues and folk-based music. Smither's 15 accompanists, who employ everything from sax to accordion to tuba, do a uniformly first-rate job with a varied program. Like Nick Drake and the Van Morrison of Astral Weeks days, Smither makes you feel as if you're in a dream. You may not want to wake up for a while.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ee7a348bf5051a4acd17996d3d678973f31ac91","amp;dn":"Chris+Smither+-+Drive+You+Home+Again+%5B1999%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ee7a348bf5051a4acd17996d3d678973f31ac91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,231,163,72,191,80,81,164,172,209,121,150,211,214,120,151,63,49,172,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
