Makes me want to see him dead. There is still distortion on the end of Modern Girl which my declipper couldnt get at since its way too embedded within the recording. but the plugin did restore the drums greatly and to a much smaller extent the vox on that track. However, the rest of the album sounds VERY CLEAN!! Enjoy. Please dont hate this cause there was unremovable distortion on one track. For this remaster is a rewarding experience on a nice stereo now","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76252f2fe758facc18ecdd7efb2c65d7b4e6a33a","amp;dn":"Sleater-Kinney+-+The+Woods+%28BrickwallHater+Remaster%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76252f2fe758facc18ecdd7efb2c65d7b4e6a33a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,37,47,47,231,88,250,204,24,236,221,126,251,44,101,215,180,230,163,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
