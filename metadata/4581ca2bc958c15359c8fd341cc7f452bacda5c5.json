It was recorded at various 1986 live shows during the European Magic Tour and released on December 1, 1986. However, it was not released in the United States until August 1996. It received strong criticism by fans, due to the heavy editing of many songs. For example, the opera section was removed from &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, the second verse was removed from &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot;, and both &quot;Is This the World We Created...?&quot; and &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; were reduced to one verse and chorus. In July 2004, Q magazine listed Live Magic as one of the top five disappointing live albums from usually great acts.\n\nMost of the performances were recorded at Knebworth Park on the 9th August 1986 (the band's last ever concert with its original line-up).\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n\n    &quot;One Vision&quot; (Queen) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:09\n    &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot; (May) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:59\n    &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot; (Mercury) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:21\n    &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot; (Taylor) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:47\n    &quot;Under Pressure&quot; (Queen, Bowie) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:49\n    &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; (Deacon) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:16\n    &quot;I Want to Break Free&quot; (Deacon) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:40\n    &quot;Is This the World We Created...?&quot; (Mercury/May) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:30\n    &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; (Mercury) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:42\n    &quot;Hammer to Fall&quot; (May) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:22\n    &quot;Radio Ga Ga&quot; (Taylor) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:27\n    &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; (May) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:33\n    &quot;Friends Will Be Friends&quot; (Mercury/Deacon) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:09\n    &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; (Mercury) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:01\n    &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; (Trad. arr.
