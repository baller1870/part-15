Produced by , Dan Hartman, Stephan Hague and others.\n\n\n\nAlbum Reviews (c/o amazon)\n\nHolly Johnson proved that he was more than just a cog in the ZTT machine\nwith his first solo release for MCA, Blast. Pure pop, with some great synth-disco leanings.\nThis album contains the popular sinlges Americanos and Love Train, plus the big,\nlush ballad, Heaven's Here.\n\nThe album starts off with the brilliant 'Atomic City' which has great vocals\nand some catchy lyrics. 'Heaven's Here' is a lush ballad which shows the great vocals from\nHolly as well as a memorable tune. 'Americanos' is probably the best known song from Holly.\nA instant hit of the time with its extremely catchy chorus, well written lyrics and tune.\n'Deep In Love' is a very catchy track with some nice lyrics. 'S.U.C.C.E.S.S.' although isn't a\nstand out track, the words are memorable. The 'Love Train' track has to be my favourite track\nof all time. The lyrics are incredible, the tune fits perfectly and the chorus is catchy.\n'Got It Made' shows Holly's vocals well with a memorable chorus. 'Love Will Come' has some\nbrilliant lyrics. 'Perfume' is a catchy dance track. 'Feel Good' shows one of the stand outs on the album.\nHoly's vocals are incredible and the song is a catchy but calmer track to finish the album.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nHolly Johnson - Blast\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nArtist.............................: Holly Johnson\nAlbum......................................: Blast\nGenre......................................: Dance\nSource........................................: CD\nYear........................................: 1989\n\nRipper: Exact Audio Copy V1.0 b1 &amp; HP DVD RW AD-7701H\n\nCodec...........: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion.........: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality.......: Lossless, (avg. compression: 64 %)\nChannels..............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags...............................: VorbisComment\n\nInformation..: Original 1989 UK pressing\n\nRipped by..............: BSW on 7/2/2011\nPosted by..............: BSW on 7/2/2011\nNews Server..........: news.astraweb.com\n\nNews Group(s).: alt.binaries.sounds.mp3.metal.full.albums\n\nIncluded....: NFO, SFV, M3U, LOG, CUE\nCovers................: Front Back CD\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n1.
