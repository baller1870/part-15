Hailing from the desert land of Arizona, Hogjaw is brandishing their own trail of rock &amp; roll, while having brought back the sound of blazing guitars and thundering drums.\nFormed by high school friends Jonboat Jones (vocals/guitar), Kreg Self (lead guitar), Elvis DD (Bass) &amp; J. &quot;Kwall&quot; Kowalski (drums) in 2006, they deliver a dose of genuine rocking goodness. Each of them have years of experience with different bands, but with combining their talent created that hard rockin monster we know today as Hogjaw. These past few years HogjawÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fan base has brought them some great accomplishments they are excited with. With lyrics telling real stories, HogjawÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Devil in the DetailsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ came out in 2008 and was among the top selling CDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in 2008-2009 through Cdbaby.com. Hogjaw videos have been in the top 10 at MTV partner &quot;Ourstage.com&quot; and they have European and American distributors with proven turn around sales. With the release of the second instalment to the Hogjaw catalog, &quot;Ironwood&quot;; in 2010, the band is still on course. &quot;Ironwood&quot; proves these guys have talent that is going to keep rolling through the songs that define the artists and keeping true to what they stand for. This sophomore release has brought Hogjaw continued and elevated success by boosting CD sales taking the number one spot at &quot;Cdbaby.com&quot; for three straight weeks as well as their song &quot;Gitsum&quot; being added to episodes on Versus Network cable TV show &quot;3-Gun Nation&quot;.
