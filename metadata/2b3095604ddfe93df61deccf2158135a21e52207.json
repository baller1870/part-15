Esbern won't talk to you or open the door during the main quest once Delphine sends you into the Ratway Warrens to talk to him. This is not only frustrating and annoying, but prevents you from moving on at all. Luckily I have the BSA Unpacker! It expands extra files that bethesda skimmed over on accident. The dialogue and audio files will now show up during gameplay. This helped me out of a bind in this situation and I finished the main quest with ease after it. The folder you will download contains the Bsa Unpacker and detailed instructions in a text file, written by me, and they are not rar files. You don't need any third party programs to open anything, I did it all for you already.\n\nIf this worked for you, please seed and leave a comment providing your proof!
