As Naruto, Sakura and Sai discuss what to do, Omoi and Karui confront them, demanding information on Sasuke, who they learn is now an Akatsuki member. Madara then tells Taka that Killer Bee had deceived them and was never actually captured. He also tells them of Konoha's recent destruction, Naruto's increased abilities and the Five Kage Summit, which Danzo will attend. \n\n198 Five Kage Summit's Eve\n \t                                 July 20, 2013\nSasuke decides that he wants to assassinate Danzo, while Karui interrogates Naruto on Sasuke. Naruto refuses to give out information and tells her that she can take her anger out on him instead, which she does until Sai finally intervenes and stops her. Later, Naruto tells Kakashi and Yamato he intends to ask the Raikage to change his mind about killing Sasuke, an idea which they are reluctant to. But as Naruto tells them the Fourth Hokage professed his belief in him, Kakashi agrees to escort Naruto to the Five Kage Summit. \n\n199 Enter the Five Kage!\n \t                                 July 27, 2013\nThe five Kage depart from their villages, each one accompanied by two bodyguards, and Danzo is attacked by a group of assassins. He uncovers his Sharingan and wipes out all his attackers effortlessly while Kakashi, Yamato and Naruto depart, tailing Samui's team. Zetsu's white half guides Taka to the Five Kage Summit in the Land of Iron, a neutral snowy nation defended by samurai. Naruto, Kakashi and Yamato confront the Raikage and Naruto begins to ask him to pardon Sasuke. \n\n200 Naruto's Plea\n  \t \t                         August 3, 2013\nNaruto tries to convince the Raikage, Ay, to stop the order of execution on Sasuke Uchiha, but he refuses and continues on his way to the Kage Summit. After White Zetsu points out Danzo to Sasuke, the five Kage gather and commence their meeting. They to discuss the growing issue of the Akatsuki until their mediator, Mifune, suggests that the five Villages make the world's first Shinobi Alliance, of which Danzo should be the leader. \n\n201 Painful Decision\n \t                                 August 10, 2013\nIn Konoha, Sai confronts Sakura, explaining to her that the reason Naruto has been so persistent on bringing back Sasuke is because he has always been in love with her and wants to honor his promise to her. Realizing she's inflicted pain upon Naruto, Sakura departs, intending to speak with him. At the Summit, the Mizukage's guard, Ao, discovers Danzo's Sharingan and accuses him of using his powers to manipulate Mifune's decision. At that moment, White Zetsu appears, announcing Sasuke's arrival at the Summit. Meanwhile, Madara confronts Naruto. \n\n202 Racing Lightning\n \t                                 August 17, 2013\nYamato and Kakashi restrain Madara, but he insists he merely intends to speak with Naruto. At the Summit, samurai begin to search for and attack Sasuke. Ay and his guards, Cee and Darui, leave the conference room and begin to fight, while Gaara questions the other Kage about their own morality. Meanwhile, Sasuke takes out Cee with genjutsu, while Ay manages to survive an exceptionally powerful strike from Jugo in his Second Level Curse Mark form and retaliates, defeating Jugo. As Darui battles Suigetsu, Sasuke and Ay commence their duel. \n\n203 Sasuke's Ninja Way\n \t                                 August 24, 2013\nMadara tells Naruto about the two sons of the Sage of the Six Paths, who are the forefathers of the Uchiha and Senju clans, revealing that the Uchiha's history of vengeance is now coursing through Sasuke's veins. He says that the only one who could stop him is Naruto, who has inherited the Senju's Will of Fire, before vanishing. Ay continues to pummel Sasuke until he unleashes his Susano'o, which Gaara saves him from. Gaara asks Sasuke to stop what he is doing to no avail, being forced to launch a combined assault on him with Kankuro, Temari and Darui, bringing Susano'o to a higher level. \n\n204 Power of the Five Kage\n\t                                 August 31, 2013\nAs Killer Bee decides to meet his Enka teacher Kin, Sasuke uses his Susano'o to destroy the pillars in the room, making the ceiling collapse. Sasuke and Karin enter the summit room, where Danzo uses Sasuke's arrival as a chance to escape and Ao pursues him. Mei decides to join the fight and proves too much for the injured Sasuke. Before she can finish him off, Sasuke is saved by Zetsu via his Spore Jutsu, allowing him to escape only to be confronted by Onoki. Onoki then finishes Sasuke off, only to discover that he was saved by Madara, who decides to let them in on his Moon's Eye Plan. \n\n205 Declaration of War\n                                         September 7, 2013\nMadara explains that the Sage of the Six Paths was once the Jinchuriki of the Ten-Tails. When the Sage died, he tore the Ten-Tails power into 9 separate parts which became the Tailed Beasts and sealed its body inside of the moon. Madara claims he wishes to revive the Ten-Tails, become its Jinchuriki, and then cast an Infinite Tsukuyomi on the entire world, making him the ruler. The Kage refuse to hand over Killer Bee and Naruto, so Madara declares the Fourth Great Ninja War on them, before leaving. The Kage then prepare to form a Shinobi Alliance as Sakura, Kiba, Lee and Sai meet up with Naruto in the Land of Iron. \n\n206 Sakura's Feelings\n \t                                 September 14, 2013\nWhile Killer Bee practices Enka with Kin-sensei, he is approached by Kisame. Meanwhile, Sakura tells Naruto she loves him, but stating that she has given up on Sasuke for good made him not believe her and she leaves to go looking for Sasuke with Kiba, Lee and Sai. As Ay, the Raikage, is elected to be leader of the Joint Shinobi Alliance, Bee continues to fight Kisame with the assistance of Kin. However, Samehada begins draining Bee's chakra substantially and grows much larger. In an apparent lull in the fight, Kisame introduces himself to Kin and Bee. \n\n207 The Tailed Beast vs. The Tailless Tailed Beast\n \t                                 September 21, 2013\nDanzo's bodyguard, Fu, uses a Mind Transfer trap on Ao, trapping him inside of a puppet while Fu commandeers his body, hoping to steal his Byakugan for Danzo. However Mizukage and Chojuro arrive and help Ao reclaim his body. Meanwhile, Kisame fuses with Samehada and traps Bee inside of a Water Dome. Kisame manages to beat Bee, but Samehada decides to betray him, favoring Bee's chakra over Kisame's. The Raikage then shows up and him and Bee decapitate Kisame together. \n\n208 As One's Friend\n \t                                 September 28, 2013\nAs Jugo and Suigetsu are caught by the samurai, a clone of Sai confronts Naruto and tells him about Sakura's intentions to kill Sasuke herself in order to free Naruto of his burden. Meanwhile, Danzo, Fu and Torune confront Madara, where both of Danzo's subordinates are sucked in by Madara. While Gaara tells Naruto that he must do whatever he must to save his friend, Madara releases Sasuke and Karin in front of Danzo, who reveals his right arm to be covered in Sharingan. \n\n209 Danzo's Right Arm\n \t                                 October 5, 2013\nKakashi decides to stop Sakura from fighting Sasuke herself, telling Yamato and Naruto to go home. But Naruto has a panic attack from the prospect of his friends murdering Sasuke and passes out. Meanwhile, Sasuke confronts Danzo, becoming angered by the Sharingan he's implanted into his arm. Sasuke attacks, and seemingly kills Danzo many times, but he keeps reviving himself. Whenever he does this, though, Karin notices one of his Sharingan begin to close. \n\n210 The Forbidden Visual Jutsu\n \t                                 October 12, 2013\nSasuke places Danzo under genjutsu but Danzo activates a curse mark he had cast upon Sasuke earlier which renders Sasuke immobile. When Danzo prepares to finish him off, Sasuke's memories of Itachi make him overpower the curse and break it. Madara realizes Danzo's jutsu which makes him invincible is a forbidden jutsu known as Izanagi. Karin realizes every Sharingan eye on Danzo's right arm lives for about 60 seconds while Izanagi is activated. Danzo and Sasuke begin to fight fiercely to see which one tires out first. \n\n211 Danzo Shimura\n\t                                 October 19, 2013\nSasuke gains the upper hand over Danzo, having tricked him into using up Izanagi. Danzo takes Karin hostage but Sasuke shoots his Chidori blade through them both, fatally wounding Danzo in the process. Danzo tries to retreat but Madara blocks him. Desperately, Danzo activates his fail-safe technique, intending to seal Sasuke and Madara away into his corpse. As he dies, Danzo recalls trying to catch up to Hiruzen, but never being able to, dying without attaining his dream of becoming Hokage just like he did. \n\n212 Sakura's Resolve\n \t                                 October 19, 2013\nSakura, Lee and Kiba are blocked by Sai, but Sakura manages to knock them all out and move along with her plan of trying to kill Sasuke. As she reminisces about Sasuke, Madara seals Danzo's corpse inside himself and disappears. Sasuke prepares to finish off Karin, who recalls the first time she met Sasuke during the Chunin Exam's Forest of Death, but Sakura arrives, stopping Sasuke and claiming that she has abandoned the Leaf Village and wants to join him. \n\n213 Lost Bonds\n\t                                 October 26, 2013\nNaruto wakes up after dreaming about Sasuke. He continues to reminisce about Sasuke, remembering how determined he had been to stop Sasuke. After losing Jiraiya, Naruto feels he has somewhat understood Sasuke's explanation about the pain from losing bonds. When he hears from Yamato that Kakashi has gone to stop Sasuke, he tricks Yamato by using a Shadow Clone and escapes. As he runs towards where Sasuke is, he thinks about what Jiraiya had told him about hatred, and what he should do as Sasuke's friend. \n\n214 The Burden\n \t\t                         November 2, 2013\nAs Kakashi heads towards Sakura, Sasuke tells her that his new ambition is to slaughter the Hidden Leaf. He asks her to prove her loyalty and love by killing Karin. However, Sasuke tries to kill her only to be stopped by Kakashi. The two fight, with Sasuke considerably weakened by his previous fight with Danzo. When she is done healing Karin, Sakura tries to attack Sasuke from behind, but hesitates. Sakura is only saved from certain death when Naruto intercepts Sasuke's attack. \n\n215 Two Fates\n -----------------------------135733153515409\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=&quot;torrent&quot;; filename=&quot;Naruto Shippuden Season 10 (Ep. 197-221) [ENG DUB].torrent&quot;\nContent-Type: application/x-bittorrent\n\nby14:uTorrent/3.4.213:creation datei1406911987e8:encoding5:UTF-84:infod13:file-durationli1361ei1403ei1402ei1390ei1391ei1408ei1405ei1390ei1410ei1388ei1404ei1389ei1330ei1406ei1379ei919ei1222ei1414ei1396ei1398ei1389ei1391ei1387ei1415ei1389ee10:file-mediali0ei0ei0ei0ei0ei0ei0ei0ei1ei0ei0ei0ei2ei0ei0ei3ei3ei0ei0ei0ei1ei0ei0ei4ei5ee5:filesld6:lengthi78173920e4:pathl31:E197 The Sixth Hokage Danzo.mp4eed6:lengthi74586754e4:pathl31:E198 Five Kage Summit's Eve.mp4eed6:lengthi90320843e4:pathl29:E199 Enter the Five Kage!.mp4eed6:lengthi33258836e4:pathl22:E200 Naruto's Plea.mp4eed6:lengthi36320150e4:pathl25:E201 Painful Decision.mp4eed6:lengthi49499977e4:pathl25:E202 Racing Lightning.mp4eed6:lengthi104104130e4:pathl27:E203 Sasuke's Ninja Way.mp4eed6:lengthi50787489e4:pathl31:E204 Power of the Five Kage.mp4eed6:lengthi45342829e4:pathl27:E205 Declaration of War.mp4eed6:lengthi50165415e4:pathl26:E206 Sakura's Feelings.mp4eed6:lengthi57440160e4:pathl55:E207 The Tailed Beast vs. The Tailless Tailed Beast.mp4eed6:lengthi88803791e4:pathl24:E208 As One's Friend.mp4eed6:lengthi72375283e4:pathl26:E209 Danzo's Right Arm.mp4eed6:lengthi115472057e4:pathl35:E210 The Forbidden Visual Jutsu.mp4eed6:lengthi100879934e4:pathl22:E211 Danzo Shimura.mp4eed6:lengthi117380549e4:pathl25:E212 Sakura's Resolve.mp4eed6:lengthi95872097e4:pathl19:E213 Lost Bonds.mp4eed6:lengthi85593544e4:pathl19:E214 The Burden.mp4eed6:lengthi88973015e4:pathl18:E215 Two Fates.mp4eed6:lengthi87813936e4:pathl19:E216 High Level.mp4eed6:lengthi97640978e4:pathl24:E217 The Infiltrator.mp4eed6:lengthi68154954e4:pathl40:E218 The Five Great Nations Mobilize.mp4eed6:lengthi103434127e4:pathl35:E219 Kakashi Hatake, the Hokage.mp4eed6:lengthi60634504e4:pathl41:E220 Prophecy of the Great Lord Elder.mp4eed6:lengthi63530782e4:pathl16:E221 Storage.mp4eee4:name26:Naruto Shippuden Season 1012:piece lengthi2097152e6:pieces18280:V[\u001dÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½G$\fÃ¯Â¿Â½x?Ã¯Â¿Â½\u0012Ã¯Â¿Â½WÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½^Ms\u0004Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½\u001f\u000b5Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½}Ã¯Â¿Â½8Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½r^YÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ZÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½E\blÃ¯Â¿Â½9[/mÃ¯Â¿Â½xyÃ¯Â¿Â½\bÃ¯Â¿Â½\u000b2Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½SvrÃ¯Â¿Â½\u0018Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½VÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã‰Å¡Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½6y1Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½lÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ÃŠÂºÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½&amp;Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã…Â¯1Ã¯Â¿Â½kÃƒÅ½_\u0013bÃâ€“Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½\u001e\f\u0005\u0013Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã“Â¬Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½\u0014Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½P\u000f7A\u0010Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½\u0002Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½JÃ¯Â¿Â½.\nPÃ¯Â¿Â½9Ã¯Â¿Â½ÃŠÂ¦!Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½#+\u0003Ã¯Â¿Â½\u000faÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½\u001d\u0015ph4Ã¯Â¿Â½^Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½!O5Ã¯Â¿Â½*Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½@b\u001a@Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½uÃ¯Â¿Â½eÃ¯Â¿Â½ :Ã¯Â¿Â½\u001bÃ¯Â¿Â½OK\u0013yÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½}Ã¯Â¿Â½-doÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ÃŸÂ¹Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½e:Ã¯Â¿Â½\tÃ¯Â¿Â½J Ã¯Â¿Â½\fs3Ã¯Â¿Â½\u0018Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½EÃ¯Â¿Â½AÃ¯Â¿Â½~Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½\u0003Ã¯Â¿Â½&gt;Ã¯Â¿Â½@Ã¯Â¿Â½\u0015VÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã‘ï¿½ÃŽÂ¿\u000fÃ¯Â¿Â½8]Ã¯Â¿Â½oÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½S#\u000bÃ¯Â¿Â½Ne\u0017Ã¯Â¿Â½HtÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½AÃ¯Â¿Â½}Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½\u0016|qÃ¯Â¿Â½\u0004/Ã¯Â¿Â½\u0016Ã¯Â¿Â½\u0013Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½%Ãˆâ€¦Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã†Â¯Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½\u0011~Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½\u0002Ã¯Â¿Â½1Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½\u001aÃ¯Â¿Â½)\t\u000bÃ¯Â¿Â½PÃ¯Â¿Â½O\u001e\u001dÃ¯Â¿Â½\u0017\u0005\u000fÃ¯Â¿Â½-Ã¯Â¿Â½ZÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½.vÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½4rÃ¯Â¿Â½[ Ã¯Â¿Â½\u0004Ã¯Â¿Â½W\u0004F\u001cG*Ã¯Â¿Â½&gt;=Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½\u001c&quot;zÃ¯Â¿Â½cÃ¯Â¿Â½CvÃ¯Â¿Â½GoÃ¯Â¿Â½\u000ehpÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½NÃ¯Â¿Â½?q~Ã¯Â¿Â½E\fÃ¯Â¿Â½DÃ¯Â¿Â½ OJÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½\nÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½'&amp;Ã¯Â¿Â½JÃ¯Â¿Â½\u0017\u001epcÃ¯Â¿Â½/ cÃ¯Â¿Â½6Ã¯Â¿Â½fÃ¯Â¿Â½8Ã¯Â¿Â½iÃ¯Â¿Â½/Ã‚â€˜ÃƒÅ½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½\u0019Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½#Ã¯Â¿Â½\u0001Ã¯Â¿Â½\nÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½zÃ¯Â¿Â½sÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½0P\fÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½[VÃ¯Â¿Â½vÃ‰â€¦Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½PÃ¯Â¿Â½\u000eW&gt;)Ã¯Â¿Â½\u001b??-XÃ¯Â¿Â½\u0001\u0006Ã¯Â¿Â½\u001cÃ¯Â¿Â½(VÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã«ËœÂ­+Ã¯Â¿Â½@\nll\u001e!\u0003|+EÃ¯Â¿Â½s}\u001eÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½RÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½@yÃ¯Â¿Â½\fÃ¯Â¿Â½\u001dÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½\u000fÃ¯Â¿Â½bÃ¯Â¿Â½KÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½o\u001aÃ¯Â¿Â½K","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f59190ab56e179ec8dba98d482e8b506bee352fa","amp;dn":"Naruto+Shippuden+Season+10+%28Ep.+197-221%29+%5BEng.+Dub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f59190ab56e179ec8dba98d482e8b506bee352fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,145,144,171,86,225,121,236,141,186,152,212,130,232,181,6,190,227,82,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
