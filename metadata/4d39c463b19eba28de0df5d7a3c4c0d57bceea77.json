We ripped them atleast twice\non 2 different Consoles and crc compared both rips. It occasionally happened,\nthat crc's and number of files were different. We blame that partly on the early\nstage of Backup Manager, but also on the fat32 filesytem.\nSo be sure your own private rips are working properly - especially if you\nplan to release them!\n\nSome games won't start if you have old gamedata on your console. So delete\nthat if neccessary!\n\nRelease Info:\n\nThis dump was made using the PSGROOVE (PSJailbreak) method using Backup\nManager 1.0 . We have tested quite a few old PS3 Scene Rips which mostly\ndidnt work correctly (empty/corrupted or missing files etc..).\n\nTo warm you up until you receive your jailbreak device we'll\nbring you a few PS3 exclusive and some major cross platform titles\nto get things going.\n\nUnrar contents to an external fat32 formatted usb drive into a\nfolder called GAMEZ (in root dir), connect it to your PS3, use\nyour usbkey to get it into service mode and play from the external drive.\nMake sure you have an original ps3 game in your drive (any game will do).\n\nNotes:\n\nBe aware that fat32 filesystem can't deal with files bigger than 4gb. So\nsome Games can't be ripped to an external hdd - only to the internal ps3\nhdd. As soon as more tools are available, we might change the format (e.g.\nusing some form of containers like .iso etc..) Time will tell :)\n\nDUPLEX is here to get the real ps3 scene going\n\nbmx!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d39c463b19eba28de0df5d7a3c4c0d57bceea77","amp;dn":"Transformers.War.for.Cybertron.PS3-DUPLEX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d39c463b19eba28de0df5d7a3c4c0d57bceea77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,57,196,99,177,158,186,40,222,13,245,215,163,196,192,213,123,206,234,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
