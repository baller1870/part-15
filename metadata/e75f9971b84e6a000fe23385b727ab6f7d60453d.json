It is to be distinguished from the quarterly, graphic-novella series, and monthly comic series that take place during the events showed in the TV show Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series), which started in December 2009. The connected stories describe the events during the Clone Wars, set between the events of Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones and Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. Important characters include Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Mace Windu, Count Dooku, the Clone Troopers, Asajj Ventress and Quinlan Vos, the last one which has not been featured in any of the Star Wars films. This series is aimed towards an older audience than that for the Clone Wars Adventures comic book series that were published around the same time. They are more complex and feature more graphic violence. A must-have immersive collection for Star Wars fans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e75f9971b84e6a000fe23385b727ab6f7d60453d","amp;dn":"Star+Wars%3A+Clone+Wars+Volumes+%231-9+%28TPB%29+%5BDark+Horse%5D+%28stefcuk%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e75f9971b84e6a000fe23385b727ab6f7d60453d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,95,153,113,184,78,106,0,15,226,51,133,183,39,171,111,125,96,69,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
