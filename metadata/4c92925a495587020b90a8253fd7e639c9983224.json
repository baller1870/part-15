Sorry for the annoyance, and thanks to blessphemy for reporting the problem. This one works : I checked twice ;)\n\n\nThis is the game &quot;The Elder Scrolls : Daggerfall&quot; from Bethesda Softworks, 1995.\nAs it is a free game since today (Bethesda celebrates the 15 years birthday of the Elder Scrolls series, thank you Bethesda!) I decided to create a ready to run application for Mac, using user fak-it special Dosbox version (like in brukerdose's releases).\nPlease SEED when you have finished downloading.\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n============\nThe Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall is a first-person computer role-playing game (CRPG) for MS-DOS, developed by Bethesda Softworks and released in 1996. It is a sequel to the CRPG The Elder Scrolls: Arena and the second installment in The Elder Scrolls series.\nDaggerfall, like the other games in the Elder Scrolls series, takes place on the fictional continent of Tamriel. In Daggerfall, the player may travel within the High Rock and Hammerfell provinces of Tamriel. The journey through these realms is made difficult by a wide range of formidable enemies, the strongest of which are the Daedra.\nDaggerfall is the largest Elder Scrolls game to date, featuring a game world estimated as being 161,600 square kilometres (62,394 square miles or 40,400,000 acres) with over 15,000 towns, cities, villages, and dungeons for the player's character to explore. According to Todd Howard, Elder Scrolls programmer, the game's sequel, The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind is 0.01% the size of Daggerfall.\n\n\nHOW TO PLAY:\n============\nJust unzip and double-click the app. Can't be easier.\n\nLEGAL:\n======\nThis game is free, so I don't think it makes any arm to anyone to release this Mac version.
