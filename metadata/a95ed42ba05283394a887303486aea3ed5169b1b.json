But this one is especially exciting because it brings together the entirety of Stanley's work for the King and Gusto labels, much of it from the late '60s when Stanley was arguably at the peak of his considerable powers. Much of this material features lead singer Larry Sparks, the man generally considered Ralph Stanley's most effective duet partner since the death of his brother Carter. Indeed, the 36 King sides were recorded shortly after Carter's untimely death and a brief but intense period of personal grief and professional uncertainty on Ralph's part. When he returned to recording and playing it was with an impressive level of energy and commitment, as these recordings make plain -- just listen to the gritty incisiveness of his renditions of &quot;Poor Rambler,&quot; &quot;I'm Better Off Now That You're Gone,&quot; and the Bill Monroe classic &quot;In the Pines.&quot; But as fine as these songs are, the real fun comes on the 12 songs that Stanley recorded for the Gusto label with Jimmy Martin handling lead vocals and rhythm guitar chores. Martin's patented buzzsaw whine and powerful guitar attack push Stanley in a way that his late brother never had, and the results are thrilling. The occasional harmonica and drums (!) are an annoyance, but not more than an annoyance. Very highly recommended.  --Rick Anderson, AllMusicGuide\n\n\nRalph Stanley and his brother Carter delivered twenty years of classic bluegrass as the Stanley Brothers. From their earliest radio exposure on WCYBÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Farm And Fun TimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Bristol, Tennessee/Virginia), through years of endless touring and major-label recording, until CarterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death in 1966, the Stanleys amassed legions of fans. Even Bill MonroeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legendary resentment of the Stanley Brothers Ã¢â‚¬â€ who occasionally recorded songs he popularized Ã¢â‚¬â€ stands as a testament to their popularity.\n\nIn recent years, the national media has recognized Stanley as bluegrass musicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest living elder statesman. But such acknowledgements are not simply the result of StanleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work on the O Brother soundtrack. Nor is this recognition an entirely new phenomenon. Lincoln Memorial University presented Stanley with an honorary doctorate in 1976 (thus his standing as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dr. RalphÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ ), and the National Endowment for the Arts named him a National Heritage Award winner in 1984. Since the early 1990s, he has recorded with everyone from George Jones and Lucinda Williams to Bob Dylan and Bill Monroe. (Resentment, it seems, can only last so long.)\n\nBut there was another rung on StanleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career ladder. In early 1967, decades before the Country Music Association would honor him as their Male Vocalist of the Year, Ralph Stanley faced a singularly difficult decision: Without Carter by his side, would he continue making music as a solo artist?\n\nEncouraged by friends and fans alike, Stanley entered the studio a few months after his brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death, and by 1969 he had recorded three albums for King Records. Poor Rambler is a three-disc set preserving each of those albums, plus tracks Stanley recorded with Jimmy Martin for their album First Time Together, released on the Gusto label in 1980.\n\nOn Brand New Country Songs, StanleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first album for King, his band included Melvin Goins, Curly Ray Cline, and a 19-year-old Larry Sparks, all of whom had worked with the Stanley Brothers. Ralph, now assuming the role of bandleader, chose to steer their music in a slightly different direction. He deliberately opted for a more distinctive mountain sound; his voice sounded nearly as ancient at 40 as it does today. On songs such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“LonesomeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Poor RamblerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, the mandolin takes a back seat to SparksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ guitar runs, and the melodies are carried by StanleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s banjo and ClineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s raw fiddling.\n\nOver The Sunset Hill, a gospel collection recorded in 1968, is the highlight of this set. The lineup of Goins, Cline and Sparks returned, with the addition of George Shuffler Ã¢â‚¬â€ another Stanley Brothers alumnus Ã¢â‚¬â€ on bass. RalphÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jesse James PrayedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Before every raid, Jesse James prayed/Maybe Jesse was a God-loving manÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ) is a curiosity that probably hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t found its way into many church hymnals. Still, this record should take its place alongside Cry From The Cross as one of StanleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most moving gospel efforts.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Hills Of HomeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, StanleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recitation honoring his brother Carter, is the title track of his final King album. CarterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s presence is also felt on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Midnight StormÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Kitten And The CatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, both of which he co-wrote. Stanley fires his banjo like a machine gun on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dug-Gunn ShameÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and SparksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ lead pushes RalphÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tenor on Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Only ExistÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Goins had left the band at this point, and Jimmy Martin, a former Blue Grass Boy himself, sat in on guitar and mandolin.\n\nUnfortunately, the fine material Stanley and Martin recorded later for Gusto seems a bit jarring. The dozen songs from that session are divided among the three discs as bonus tracks, and tend to sneak in from left field. As opposed to the King recordings, which mainly included Stanley originals, the Stanley-Martin set favored songs such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Footprints In The SnowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“In The PinesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rabbit In The LogÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (songs, incidentally, that were first associated with Monroe). The more modern production style, which included the use of a drum set, also makes for some difficult transitions. --David Baxter, No Depression\n\n\nTrack Listing:\nCD1:\n1. Sharecropper's Son \n2.
