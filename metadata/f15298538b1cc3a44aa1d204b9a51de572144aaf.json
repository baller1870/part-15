In the\nsame way, Subheims sound has evolved and\nmatured greatly: from a prominently\nelectronic basis, this project has now\nembraced a much more acoustic composition.\nLive drums and strings, field recordings,\nhorns provide a very organic texture to\nNo Land Called Home, bringing at times a\nresolutely jazz feeling to the deep and\nsombre overall atmospheres. And, of\ncourse, the much stronger presence of\nvocals throughout this album also adds to\nthe human and soulful nature of this\nalbum. Subheim live vocalist Katja lends\nher voice to more than half of the tracks,\nand Timothy N. Gregorys emotional\npresence on The Veil confirms Subheims\ntalent at writing not only tracks, but\nfull songs.\n\nAt times gentle, at times epic, always\nhumane and evocative, No Land Called\nHome is both the fruit and the invitation\nto a deeply introspective contemplation.\nSatisfied by neither completely electronic\ndroning nor a fully acoustic / rock\nstructure, Subheim create here a bridge\nbetween both and manages to use the best\nof both genres while keeping their sound\ncoherent, vivid and personal.\n\nThe cover art to Subheims dbut album was\nshowing the middle of a flowing river, the\none to No Land Called Home displays a\nreclining tide, welcoming to birds and\npeople alike: the land has been reached,\nwhichever it might be.\n\n\n\n\n\ng r o u p    n o t e s\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe  are  a  small  group of rather  friendly\npeople  (with few exceptions!)  whod prefer\nwasting   their   time   releasing  scatporn\ninstead of  ripping  those  crappy  (mostly)\nelectronic releases nobody even cares about.\n\nOf  course  we  release  all  what  we  hate\nbecause hate is a much stronger feeling than\nlove and when you  think about it,  there is\nno  point  wasting   money  on  loved  ones.\n\nFinally if you ever like one of our releases\n(and not only ours...), go fuck a goat, sell\nthe video and buy the damn  vinyl/cd/dvd ...\n... thats double pleasure !\n\nWe  would  like  to share  a goat  with  the\nfollowings for their work and/or friendship,\nof  course in -almost- no  particular order:\n\nTrT - DPS - MAEM - mbs - bASS - kiNky - soup\nsour - XTC - FWYH - D2H - BCC - BOSS - FMR\nETHNiC - CT - i8 - 1way - hM - SQ - HQEM\nhUSHhUSH - SiCKO - AEROHOLICS - BERC\nSexSh0p - JustDifferent\n\ndefacing music since\n2004\n\n\n\n2  0  1  0\n\n\n\n\nfUrPC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f15298538b1cc3a44aa1d204b9a51de572144aaf","amp;dn":"Subheim-No_Land_Called_Home-%28ADN133CD%29-2010-DEF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f15298538b1cc3a44aa1d204b9a51de572144aaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,82,152,83,139,28,195,164,74,161,210,4,185,165,29,229,114,20,74,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
