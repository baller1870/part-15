It is lucidly written and is suitable for undergraduate as well as first year postgraduate course in civil engineering with soil mechanics and foundation engineering at undergraduate level as prerequisite.\n\nKey Features:\nSubject matter is organised logically to make it easy and interesting for the students.\nEmphasis has been given on the basics of geotechnical earthquake engineering.\nHome work problems have been given at the end of each chapter to test the understanding of concepts given in the chapter.\nAt the end of appropriate chapters solved numerical problems as well as exercise numerical problems as home work problems have also been to make the related concepts clear.\nAbout the Author(s):\nDr. Kamalesh Kumar\nis with civil engineering, Biria Institute of Technology &amp; Science (BITS), Pilani, Rajasthan. He obtained his B. Tech. degree from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur and M. S. degree from Lehigh University, Pennsylvania, USA. He completed his Ph. D. from BITS Pilani, Rajasthan in 2002. He has research publications in one international conference, three national conferences and two national journals. He has contributed chapter on geotechnical earthquake engineering for the lecture notes developed by civil engineering group, BITS Pilani for earthquake risk management. His area of specialization is geotechnical engineering. He is actively involved in the soil consultancy projects to determine its bearing capacity. He is member of Phi-Beta-Delta honour society for international scholars.\n\nContents:\nIntroduction to Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering\nEarthquakes\nSeismic Hazards in India\nDynamic Soil Properties\nSite Seismicity, Seismic Soil Response and Design Earthquake\nLiquefaction\nEarthquake Resistant Design for Shallow Foundation\nEarthquake Resistant Design of Deep Foundation\nSlope Stability Analyses for Earthquakes\nRetaining Wall Analyses for Earthquakes\nEarthquake Resistant Design of Buildings","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71d913f45c3117006b5e7683048b09e738701e29","amp;dn":"Basic+Geotechnical+Earthquake+Engineering+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71d913f45c3117006b5e7683048b09e738701e29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,217,19,244,92,49,23,0,107,94,118,131,4,139,9,231,56,112,30,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
