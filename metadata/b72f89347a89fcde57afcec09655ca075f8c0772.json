Produced by Daniel Rey, this is the perfect introduction for those unfamiliar with Teenage Head's unique Ramones-meet-Eddie Cochrane-meets-New York Dolls sound. The idea for this recording started when Head guitarist Gord Lewis and bassist Steve Marshall performed a short set with Marky Ramone at the conclusion of a couple of his spoken word performances. With eight albums of material to choose from, Teenage Head with Marky Ramone is a 12-track collection of high-energy `70s-style punk rock that borrows most heavily from the group's 1979 self-titled debut album. \n\n.. On October 15th, 2008, Gord Lewis announced that Frank Kerr had died following a battle with throat cancer... \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b72f89347a89fcde57afcec09655ca075f8c0772","amp;dn":"Teenage+Head+-+Teenage+Head+with+Marky+Ramone+%282008%29+%5Bmp3%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b72f89347a89fcde57afcec09655ca075f8c0772","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,47,137,52,122,137,252,222,87,175,206,192,150,85,202,7,95,140,7,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
