Beyond the battlefield, the book also looks at the impact of artillery on history and on the lives of civilians as well as soldiers.\n\n\n\n\nPublisher \tABC-CLIO (March 28, 2007)\nLanguage \tEnglish\nISBN-10 \t185109556X\nISBN-13 \t978-1851095568\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Artillery-Illustrated-History-Weapons-Warfare/dp/185109556X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372640747&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Artillery%3A+An+Illustrated+History+of+Its+Impact&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Artillery-Illustrated-History-Weapons-Warfare/dp/185109556X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372640747&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Artillery%3A+An+Illustrated+History+of+Its+Impact&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c58ff3b0f3b18a5add34369e83b5e31267ebdc6","amp;dn":"Artillery%3A+An+Illustrated+History+of+Its+Impact+%5B+blackatk%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c58ff3b0f3b18a5add34369e83b5e31267ebdc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,88,255,59,15,59,24,165,173,211,67,105,232,59,94,49,38,126,189,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
