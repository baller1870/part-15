It somewhat reminds me of The Grissom Gang (1970) - you can see the resemblances between Temple Drake and Barbara Blandish - surely Robert Aldrich took a close look at this. It is surprising that such a story made it to the screen in the 1930s.\n\nThere is said to be a restored version making the rounds, this is definitely not it. This is a small file, you can judge whether yu think it worth chasing after a better one.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbdab687c033a0ed448b388a7479cd65b03936cd","amp;dn":"Story+of+Temple+Drake+%281933%29+William+Faulkner+Miriam+Hopkins","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbdab687c033a0ed448b388a7479cd65b03936cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,218,182,135,192,51,160,237,68,139,56,138,116,121,205,101,176,57,54,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
