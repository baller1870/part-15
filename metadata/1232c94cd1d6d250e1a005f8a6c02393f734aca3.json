If you are looking for fun and history at the same time, these lectures are worth your time and investment--still worth the investment if you are just looking for great laughs!\n\n\n\n16)  Geoffrey Chaucer \nIf you ask most people what they know about Geoffrey Chaucer, they'll probably reply that he was the bloke who wrote bawdy poems about people sticking their bums out of windows and breaking wind. Which, strictly speaking, is true? However, through his writing Chaucer not only managed to become considered as the father of English poetry, he also attained the lofty position of being this country's first ever social commentator. The son of a winekeeper, Geoffrey Chaucer was born around 1342 in London at a time of enormous social change. When he was a young boy, the Black Death swept into England and whilst this was certainly bad news for most, Chaucer ended up becoming a notable beneficiary of its devastating effects. Up until this point, social mobility between the classes hadn't really existed - essentially you stayed in the class that you were born into; which was either the nobility where you owned the land or the peasantry where you worked the land. One consequence of the Black Death was that it created a labour shortage and as a result, the middle ranks of the Royal Court had to be replaced with un noble blood. Which is precisely where a young Chaucer fitted in. Now, for the first time it was actually possible to move from one social class to another and Chaucer took full advantage of this; his subsequent experiences went on to form a sturdy foundation for his later writings...\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img526.imageshack.us/img526/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img526.imageshack.us/img526/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img717.imageshack.us/img717/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img717.imageshack.us/img717/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img338.imageshack.us/img338/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img338.imageshack.us/img338/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1537 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s MP3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 30mins\n * Number Of Parts: 18\n * Part Size: 349 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by Harry65\n * Thanks to llambert\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Steel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Steel&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1232c94cd1d6d250e1a005f8a6c02393f734aca3","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Mark+Steel+Lectures+Series+1+to+3+16of18+Geoffrey+Chauce","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1232c94cd1d6d250e1a005f8a6c02393f734aca3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,50,201,76,209,214,210,80,225,160,5,248,166,192,35,147,247,52,172,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
