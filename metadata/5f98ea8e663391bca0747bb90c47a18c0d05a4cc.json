To their neighbors, Dorrie and Sam Whiteare a contented couple in AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heartland, with steady jobs, a suburban home, and plenty of community activities to keep them busy. But theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not quite what they seem. For plain, hard-working Sam hides a depth of devotion for his wife that no one would suspect. And Dorrie is living a lie--beset by physical ailments, alone within herself...and secretly following the comings and goings of the sixteen-year-old daughter, Juliet, she gave up for adoption when she was hardly more than a child herself. Then one day at the mall, Dorrie watches horror-stricken as Juliet is abducted, forced into a van that drives away. Instinctively, Dorrie sends her own car speeding after it--an act of reckless courage that puts her on a collision course with a depraved killer...and draws Sam into a dogged, desperate search to save his wife. As mother and daughter unite in a terrifying struggle to survive, to what extremes will Dorrie go in overcoming her own limitations...and in confronting her dark, tormented past?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f98ea8e663391bca0747bb90c47a18c0d05a4cc","amp;dn":"Dark+Lie+-+Nancy+Springer.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f98ea8e663391bca0747bb90c47a18c0d05a4cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,152,234,142,102,51,145,188,160,116,123,185,12,71,161,140,13,5,164,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
