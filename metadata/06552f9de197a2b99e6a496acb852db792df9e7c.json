He only has a few weeks to live. Furious, he refuses to speak to anyone except straight-talking Rose, the lady in pink he meets on the hospital stairs. As Christmas approaches, Rose uses her fantastical experiences as a professional wrestler, her imagination, wit and charm to allow Oscar to live life and love to the full, in the company of his friends Pop Corn, Einstein, Bacon and childhood sweetheart Peggy Blue.\n\nExtras stripped.\n\n\nSize: 4.70 Gb ( 4Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â 926Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â 820 KBytes ) - DVD-9\nEnabled regions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\nPlay Length: 01:41:28\nVideo: PAL 16:9 (720x576) VBR, Auto Letterboxed\nAudio: Francais (Dolby AC3, 6 ch) Russian (Dolby AC3, 6 ch)\nSubtitles: English, Nederlands, Russian\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06552f9de197a2b99e6a496acb852db792df9e7c","amp;dn":"Oscar+et+la+Dame+Rose+%282009%29+DVD9+rus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06552f9de197a2b99e6a496acb852db792df9e7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,85,47,157,225,151,162,185,158,106,73,106,203,133,45,183,146,223,158,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
