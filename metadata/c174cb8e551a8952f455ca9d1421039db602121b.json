This love becomes overwhelming and takes precedence over his family and work. What starts off as relatively harmless -- though disturbing -- gets increasingly troublesome to the point where the man must defend himself at any cost.\n\nIf you think the only sheep film in the horror genre is &quot;Black Sheep&quot;, you're dead wrong. As great as that film is, this one is probably better. In my opinion, this film really treads the ground that make horror films memorable and fun. Remember, the first goal of a movie is to be entertaining... and if you're the sort who likes sick humor, this film is going to hit the spot. (I acquired it around the same time as &quot;Sick Girl&quot;, and I think they make a nice pair.) This film had to be a foreign film. American sensibilities would not have been able to present such a portrayal. I mean, you could do it if it was independent, but still not in this sense. There's a &quot;feel&quot; that American films can't reach, and this one can... which brings me to a final point.\n\n&quot;Animalada&quot; has a similar visual style to Peter Jackson's &quot;Dead Alive&quot;. If someone had told me this was an early Jackson film, I wouldn't doubt them. And that's a good thing... for as great as Jackson has become, his strength was -- for me -- his work on &quot;Bad Taste&quot; and &quot;Meet the Feebles&quot;. Even &quot;The Frighteners&quot; was too polished. So, for the director of this film, you succeeded in emulating a master, even if that wasn't your pan. from IMDb.\n\n\nFile Name .........................................: Sergio Bizzio - Animalada (2001).avi \nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,100,527,616 bytes \nRuntime ............................................: 1:33:50 \n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4 \nFrame Size ......................................: 624x352 (AR: 1.773) \nFPS .................................................: 23.976 \nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1429 kb/s \nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.271 bpp \nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], [] \n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3 \nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz \nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 128 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR \nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c174cb8e551a8952f455ca9d1421039db602121b","amp;dn":"Animalada+%28Sergio+Bizzio%2C+2001%29+DVDRip+XVID","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c174cb8e551a8952f455ca9d1421039db602121b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,116,203,142,85,26,137,82,244,85,202,157,20,33,3,157,182,2,18,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
