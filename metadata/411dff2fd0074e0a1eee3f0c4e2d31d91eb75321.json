In many cases, these barbarian tribes were hired as mercenaries and served the Empire as hired muscle against other barbarians.  Some of the most famous of these groups, two of which went on to become extremely important in post- Imperial Europe. The Franks, under the ruthless, but powerful, King Clovis, would found a great kingdom of their own and lay the foundations for the Holy Roman Empire. \n\n\nThe Saxons, surging west from Germania, would launch an invasion of Britain, claiming lands vacated by the retreating Romans, and served as the deadly enemies of the Britannic warlord who became the basis for the mythical King Arthur. The Vandals and the Lombards, though less well-known, also left their bloody mark on history as enemies of the Empire.\n \n\nThis period of history saw the collapse of civilization in the West and the emergence of a chaotic time known to history as the Dark Ages. At the same time, Christianity spread throughout Europe, largely at the hands of the Barbarians themselves who came to embrace, at least nominally, a belief in Christ.\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Struan Rodger\n==========================\n\n\nWritten by: Kate Youngdahl\n==========================\n\n\nProduced by: Robert Gardner\n===========================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Barbarians II The Lombards\nYear.................:    2007\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    00:41:54\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    256 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3)\nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    640x480\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    2494 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A) \nFile Size:...........:    747 MB\nFPS..................:    25.000000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2007\n\n\n\n\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1209451/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1209451/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\\\\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\\\\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\\\\\&quot;nfo\\\\\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             *** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n\n\n\n\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:411dff2fd0074e0a1eee3f0c4e2d31d91eb75321","amp;dn":"Barbarians+II+The+Lombards-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"411dff2fd0074e0a1eee3f0c4e2d31d91eb75321","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,29,255,47,208,7,78,10,30,238,63,12,78,45,49,217,30,183,83,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
