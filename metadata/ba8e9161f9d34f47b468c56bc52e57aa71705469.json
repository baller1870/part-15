This was Elvis second Christmas album and this CD re-issues features one bonus track not featured on the original LP version, 'Blue Christmas' (Live from his Comeback Special).\n\nAllmusic Review:\nElvis Presley's 1971 holiday album Elvis Sings &quot;The Wonderful World of Christmas&quot; may not be as irresistible as his 1957 masterpiece Christmas Album, but it's nevertheless an enjoyable record. There are no surprises here, either in the selection of tunes (&quot;O Come, All Ye Faithful,&quot; &quot;The First Noel,&quot; &quot;Winter Wonderland,&quot; &quot;Merry Christmas, Baby&quot;) or in its soul and country-inflected pop arrangements, but it's a solid record that will please Elvis fans. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba8e9161f9d34f47b468c56bc52e57aa71705469","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+Elvis+Sings+The+Wonderful+World+of+Christmas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba8e9161f9d34f47b468c56bc52e57aa71705469","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,142,145,97,249,211,79,71,180,104,197,107,197,46,87,170,113,112,84,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
