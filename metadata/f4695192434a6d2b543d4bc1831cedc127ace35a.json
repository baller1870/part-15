The first one is the one we are used to. The alternate mix has the drums mixed more up front. \n\n Bob Terry Source Tapes&gt;RCA 630HF HI-Fi Stereo VHS recorder (SP speed, audio only mode)&gt; Lucid analog to digital converter&gt;firewire&gt;Macbook&gt;SoundStudio&gt;.wav&gt;flac.\n\n This RCA deck is the actual deck used to record these tapes. Great to have as hi-fi audio played back on a non-original machine usually picks up a 60 hertz hum. That was a problem until the original deck was located!\n\n Big, big thanks to Bill B.. of New J.. for the tapes!\n\n\n\n 10-10-68 1st Show 40:03\n 1. Intro 3:33\n 2. Are You Experienced? 7:22\n 3.
