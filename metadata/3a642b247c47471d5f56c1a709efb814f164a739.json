Integrating the riot's story into the broader fabric of American life, the documentary connects the event to urban renewal, anti-war activism, civil rights and sexual liberation. With enticing archival footage and period music, this unknown story is dramatically brought back to life.&quot;\n\nQuality is unknown as this is a festival version.\n\nalso, the imdb for this needs to be rewritten. like seriously.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a642b247c47471d5f56c1a709efb814f164a739","amp;dn":"Screaming+Queens%3A+The+Riot+At+Compton%27s+Cafeteria+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a642b247c47471d5f56c1a709efb814f164a739","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,100,43,36,124,71,71,29,95,86,193,167,9,239,184,20,241,100,167,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
