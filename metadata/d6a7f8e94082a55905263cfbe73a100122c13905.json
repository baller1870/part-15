Infected Voice\n\n\nThis record was issued before the official release of &quot;Arise&quot; as Sepultura played on the &quot;Rock in Rio&quot; festival. EstÃƒÂºdio Eldorado couldn't wait until the record was complete and released this record for the Brazilian market only. It has alternative artwork which was also used on the &quot;Under Siege&quot; single. It's basically an excerpt of the upper part of the full artwork. \n\nIt comprises the Scott Burns rough mix of the album opposed to the final mix by Andy Wallace. Some songs also lack overdubs which appeared on the final mix. \n\nRecorded and mixed at Morrisound Recording, Tampa, FL.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6a7f8e94082a55905263cfbe73a100122c13905","amp;dn":"Sepultura+-+1991+-+Arise+%28Rough+Mixes+Limited+Edition+For+Rock+I","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6a7f8e94082a55905263cfbe73a100122c13905","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,167,248,233,64,130,165,89,5,38,60,251,231,58,16,1,34,193,57,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
