The show aired on the CBS network from October 25, 1982 to May 21, 1990. TV Guide, TV Land, and other media organizations named its series finale as one of the most memorable in television history.Newhart was nominated for one Casting Society of America award, nominated 25 times for Emmy Awards for acting writing, and editing; received six Golden Globes nominations, four nominations for TV Land Awards, and five wins of Viewers for Quality Television Awards.\n\nCast\n\n    * Bob Newhart as Dick Loudon.\n\n    * Mary Frann as Joanna Loudon.\n\n    * Tom Poston as George Utley, the Stratford's somewhat dim handyman.\n\n    * Jennifer Holmes as Leslie Vanderkellen. A fabulously rich, world-class skier, with a foundation that underwrites Jacques-Yves Cousteau, Leslie takes the job of hotel maid to find out what it is like to be normal. In the second season, she is replaced by her cousin, Stephanie.\n\n    * Julia Duffy as Stephanie Vanderkellen. Stephanie is a spoiled rich girl cut off by her parents. She grudgingly, and often incompetently, works in Leslie's old job.\n\n    * Steven Kampmann as Kirk Devane, a chronic liar who owns the Minuteman CafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© across from the inn, and holds an unrequited infatuation for Leslie. Kirk eventually marries a woman named Cindy and leaves town after two seasons.\n\n    * William Sanderson, Tony Papenfuss, and John Voldstad as brothers Larry, Darryl and Darryl. The three, whose last name is never mentioned, are backwoodsmen who live in a shack. They are seen infrequently in the first season, a bit more in the second, but at the start of season three, they become regulars and take over the Minuteman CafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© from Kirk Devane. The two Darryls are afraid to speak (until the final episode), and in a monotone voice, because if they did, they might disappoint Larry, and he introduces the group the same way every time they make an appearance: &quot;Hi, I'm Larry, this is my brother Darryl, and this is my other brother Darryl.&quot; Larry often makes strange claims, though some of the most outrageous things he says turn out to be true, including a statement that Johnny Carson pays their gas bills. But when the two Darryls have stopped them shouting in the series finale with their new found word, &quot;QUIET&quot;, they can speak to Larry and Newhart The trio also appeared in various episodes of the television series Coach. Barry Kemp created both shows. Once the characters became popular, their entrances were greeted by loud applause, similar to that of Fonzie on Happy Days.\n\n    * Peter Scolari as Michael Harris. The hyperactive, manipulative producer of Dick's TV show eventually marries Stephanie. They have a daughter. Exceptionally shallow and superficial, Michael and Stephanie represent the quintessence of the 1980s &quot;yuppie&quot; couple. The dry erase board in Michael's apartment always lists &quot;Take Over CBS&quot; (the network which originally aired the series) among his ever-changing daily tasks. He often speaks in an annoyingly alliterative manner.\n\nOther recurring characters included:\n\n    * Rebecca York as Cindy Parker-Devane, a professional clown, Kirk's girlfriend and eventual wife\n    * Todd Susman as Officer Shifflett, the over-the-top macho police chief\n    * Kathy Kinney as Prudence Goddard, the prim but hot-to-trot librarian\n    * William Lanteau as Chester Wanamaker, the fussbudget, small-minded mayor\n    * Thomas Hill as Jim Dixon, Chester's wild-eyed friend\n    * David Pressman as Mr. Rusnak, the town's racist and chauvinist shoe store owner.
