They became known for energetic live performances which often included instrument destruction.[2][3] The Who have sold about 100 million records,[4] and have charted 27 top forty singles in the United Kingdom and United States, as well as 17 top ten albums, with 18 Gold, 12 Platinum and 5 Multi-Platinum album awards in the United States alone.[5]\n\nThe Who rose to fame in the UK with a series of top ten hit singles, boosted in part by pirate radio stations such as Radio Caroline, beginning in January 1965 with &quot;I Can't Explain&quot;. The albums My Generation (1965), A Quick One (1966) and The Who Sell Out (1967) followed, with the first two reaching the UK top five. They first hit the US Top 40 in 1967 with &quot;Happy Jack&quot; and hit the top ten later that year with &quot;I Can See for Miles&quot;. Their fame grew with memorable performances at the Monterey Pop,[6] Woodstock[7] and Isle of Wight music festivals. The 1969 release of Tommy was the first in a series of top ten albums in the US, followed by Live at Leeds (1970), Who's Next (1971), Quadrophenia (1973), The Who by Numbers (1975), Who Are You (1978) and The Kids Are Alright (1979).\n\nMoon died at the age of 32 in 1978, after which the band released two studio albums, the UK and US top five Face Dances (1981) and the US top ten It's Hard (1982), with drummer Kenney Jones, before disbanding in 1983. They re-formed at events such as Live Aid and for reunion tours such as their 25th anniversary tour (1989) and the Quadrophenia tours of 1996 and 1997. In 2000, the three surviving original members discussed recording an album of new material, but their plans temporarily stalled upon Entwistle's death at the age of 57 in 2002. Townshend and Daltrey continue to perform as The Who, and in 2006 they released the studio album Endless Wire, which reached the top ten in the UK and US.\n\nThe Who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990, their first year of eligibility.[7][8] Their display there describes them as &quot;Prime contenders, in the minds of many, for the title of World's Greatest Rock Band.&quot;[9] Time magazine wrote in 1979 that &quot;No other group has ever pushed rock so far, or asked so much from it.&quot;[10] Rolling Stone magazine wrote: &quot;Along with The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, The Who complete the holy trinity of British rock.&quot;[11] They received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the British Phonographic Industry in 1988, and from the Grammy Foundation in 2001, for creative contributions of outstanding artistic significance to the field of recording.[12][13] In 2008 surviving members Townshend and Daltrey were honoured at the 31st Annual Kennedy Center Honors. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive at The Isle of Wight Festival 1970\n\n\nLive at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970 is a live album by The Who, recorded at the Isle of Wight Festival on 29 August 1970, and released by Sony in 1996. A DVD of the concert was also released.[1]\n\nThe Who were one year and three months into their Tommy tour when they played their second engagement at the Isle of Wight Festival. As in 1969, they played most of their famous rock opera, which by this time was quite familiar to the festival crowd. Huge spotlights bathed the audience of some 600,000 attendees, and as The Who's tour manager John Woolf recalls, attracted &quot;every moth and flying nocturnal animal on the island.&quot;[2]\n\nBy August 1970, Pete Townshend was already introducing new songs to the setlist including &quot;Water&quot;, &quot;I Don't Even Know Myself&quot;, and &quot;Naked Eye&quot;. These songs, which were being recorded at the time of the festival, were intended for an upcoming project known as Lifehouse. Although Lifehouse was eventually abandoned, the sessions paved the way to the Who's classic album Who's Next.\n\nThe Who also performed some live staples such as &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;, &quot;Substitute&quot;, &quot;My Generation&quot;, &quot;Magic Bus&quot;, &quot;I Can't Explain&quot;, and the perennial covers of &quot;Shakin' All Over&quot; and &quot;Summertime Blues&quot;.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n\nDisc 1 \n\n1.\t&quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; (John Entwistle) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:16\n2.\t&quot;I Can't Explain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:45\n3.\t&quot;Young Man Blues&quot; (Mose Allison) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:06\n4.\t&quot;I Don't Even Know Myself&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:11\n5.\t&quot;Water&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 10:53\n6.\t&quot;Overture&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:08\n7.\t&quot;It's a Boy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:33\n8.\t&quot;1921&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:27\n9.\t&quot;Amazing Journey&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:19\n10.\t&quot;Sparks&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:10\n11.\t&quot;Eyesight to the Blind (The Hawker)&quot; (Sonny Boy Williamson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:58\n12.\t&quot;Christmas&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n\n\n\nDisc 2 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;The Acid Queen&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:41\n2.\t&quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:50\n3.\t&quot;Do You Think It's Alright?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:22\n4.\t&quot;Fiddle About&quot; (John Entwistle) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:15\n5.\t&quot;Tommy, Can You Hear Me?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:58\n6.\t&quot;There's a Doctor&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:22\n7.\t&quot;Go to the Mirror!&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32\n8.\t&quot;Smash the Mirror&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:16\n9.\t&quot;Miracle Cure&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:13\n10.\t&quot;I'm Free&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:24\n11.\t&quot;Tommy's Holiday Camp&quot; (Keith Moon) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:01\n12.\t&quot;We're Not Gonna Take It&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:37\n13.\t&quot;Summertime Blues&quot; (Eddie Cochran, Jerry Capehart) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24\n14.\t&quot;Shakin' All Over / Spoonful / Twist and Shout&quot; (Johnny Kidd / Willie Dixon / Phil Medley and Bert Russell) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:27\n15.\t&quot;Substitute&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:10\n16.\t&quot;My Generation&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:15\n17.\t&quot;Naked Eye&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:33\n18.\t&quot;Magic Bus&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97fd06ed6c0b2a6ade8f93b59e62e8555e488202","amp;dn":"The+Who+-+Live+at+The+Isle+of+Wight+Festival+1970+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97fd06ed6c0b2a6ade8f93b59e62e8555e488202","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,253,6,237,108,11,42,106,222,143,147,181,158,98,232,85,94,72,130,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
