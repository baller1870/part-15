Want to learn more? Whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a self-taught iPhone and iPad apps development genius or have just made your way through the pages of Beginning iOS 6 Development, we have the perfect book for you.\n\nMore iOS 6 Development: Further Explorations of the iOS SDK digs deeper into AppleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest iOS 6 SDK. Bestselling authors Dave Mark, Alex Horovitz, Kevin Kim and Jeff LaMarche explain concepts as only they canÃ¢â‚¬â€covering topics like Core Data, peer-to-peer networking using GameKit and network streams, working with data from the web, MapKit, in-application e-mail, and more. All the concepts and APIs are clearly presented with code snippets you can customize and use, as you like, in your own apps.\n\nIf you are going to write a professional iPhone or iPad app, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll want to get your arms around Core Data, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no better place to do so than in the pages of this book. The book continues right where Beginning iOS 6 Development leaves off, with a series of chapters devoted to Core Data, the standard for Apple persistence. Dave, Alex, Kevin and Jeff carefully step through each Core Data concept and show techniques and tips specifically for writing larger appsÃ¢â‚¬â€offering a breadth of coverage you won't find anywhere else.\n\nThe Core Data coverage alone is worth the price of admission. But there's so much more! More iOS 6 Development covers a variety of networking mechanisms, from GameKitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relatively simple BlueTooth peer-to-peer model, to the addition of Bonjour discovery and network streams, through the complexity of accessing files via the web.\n\nDave, Alex, Kevin, and Jeff will also take you through coverage of concurrent programming and some advanced techniques for debugging your applications. The enhanced multitasking, threading, memory management and more are important. Apps are getting more and more complex, including sophisticated game apps that offer virtual or augmented reality experiences and new mapping views that take advantage of sensors and other APIs in the newest iOS 6 SDK.\n\nWhether you are a relative newcomer to iPhone and iPad or iOS development or an old hand looking to expand your horizons, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something for everyone in More iOS 6 Development.\n\n \n\nWhat youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn\nAll about Core Data: key concepts and techniques for writing larger applications\nHow to utilize a variety of networking mechanisms, including peer-to-peer connections over Bluetooth using GameKit\nDetails on the addition of Bonjour discovery and network streams\nHow to embed maps with Map Kit and use in-application email\nHow to access a userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s iPod library and integrate music into apps\nEssentials of concurrent programming and advanced debugging techniques\nHow to work with enhanced multitasking, threading, memory management and other APIs\nTips on working with data from the web and the cloud, including Apple's  iCloud \nHow to work with the iOS 6 SDK when dealing with sensors, gyroscopes, etc. for augmented reality experiences in game and socia media apps\nWho this book is for\nAll iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad app developers, especially developers already familiar with the basics of Apple's iPhone SDKs and who have read the previous volume, Beginning iOS 6 Development.\n\nTable of Contents\nHere We Go Round Again\nCore Data The What, Why &amp; How\nA Super Start: Adding, Displaying, and Deleting Data\nThe Devil in the Detail View\nPreparing for Change: Migrations and Versioning\nCustom Managed Objects\nRelationships, Fetched Properties, and Expressions\niCloud Storage\nPeer-to-Peer Over Bluetooth Using GameKit\nMapKit - new geocoding\nMessaging: Mail, Twitter, and iMessage\niPod Library Access\nLocking It Down: Generic Security Services Framework\nKeeping Your Interface Responsive: Advanced Storyboarding\nUnit Testing, Debugging, and Instruments\nThe Road Goes Ever On...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14704be030035aa521186ed73d550106ac6b017d","amp;dn":"More+iOS+6+Development+%28Epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14704be030035aa521186ed73d550106ac6b017d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,112,75,224,48,3,90,165,33,24,110,215,61,85,1,6,172,107,1,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
