A very dark secret.\n\nAn archivist for the Smithsonian Institute and also a part-time operative for the CIA, no one would ever suspect the handsome Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthirty-ishÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ William is in fact the most reviled human being to ever walk the earth. His infectious warmth and sense of humor make such an assertion especially hard to believe.\n\nBut long ago, William Barrow had another nameÃ¢â‚¬Â¦one that is synonymous with shame and betrayal: Judas Iscariot.\n\nForced to walk the earth as a cursed immortal, William/Judas is on a quest to reclaim the thirty silver shekels paid to him in exchange for Jesus Christ. Twenty-one coins have now been recoveredÃ¢â‚¬â€thanks in large part to the help from his latest son, the esteemed Georgetown University history professor, Alistair Barrow. \n\nEver hopeful the complete coin collection will buy him a full pardon from God and end his banishment from heaven, William plans a visit to a remote village deep within IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Alborz Mountains to retrieve Ã¢â‚¬Ëœsilver coin number twenty-twoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. But the CIA has a different objective for this trip, one that pits both father and son against an unscrupulous Russian billionaire searching for something else thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just as precious within the ancient mountains of IranÃ¢â‚¬Â¦something that threatens peace in the modern world if William and Alistair fail to reach it first.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c86933f941c73a3e94be30125d2c0b105f7e0d97","amp;dn":"Aiden+James+-+The+Judas+Chronicles+series+%28Books+1+-+5%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c86933f941c73a3e94be30125d2c0b105f7e0d97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,105,51,249,65,199,58,62,148,190,48,18,93,44,11,16,95,126,13,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
