Characters in the game come to call the zombies &quot;walkers&quot;, due to the slowness of their movement. Although the survivors initially think that being bitten by a zombie is the only way to become infected, it is later discovered that one becomes a zombie upon death irrespective of the manner in which one dies; only by damaging the brain can the reanimation be stopped. As with the comic and television series, the game's events occur in the state of Georgia.\n\n\nInstall Notes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n1, Download and Play\n2, Enjoy!\n3, Support The Developer(s), BUY THE GAME!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d513e8ed461352ed9e7f3ef8810195edf7f6341","amp;dn":"The+Walking+Dead+Episode+1+2+3+4+5+and+the+400+Days+DLC+FULL+Cra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d513e8ed461352ed9e7f3ef8810195edf7f6341","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,81,62,142,212,97,53,46,217,231,243,239,136,16,25,94,223,127,99,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
