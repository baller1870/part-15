Articles range from 1,000 to 4,000 words.\n\nVolume 1 has a list of entries and a separate list of entries arranged by theme. Themes include &quot;Architects and Firms&quot; (the largest category, with 267 entries); &quot;Building Types&quot; (52 entries); &quot;Buildings and Sites&quot; (172 entries); &quot;Countries and Regions&quot; (35 entries); &quot;Materials and Building Technology&quot; (36 entries); and others. Examples of topics include Acoustics; Bank of China Tower; Concrete; Gas station; Israel; Paul, Bruno; Tent; and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.\n\nArticles on buildings include designer name(s), date of completion, and location and often describe design features, architectural themes and influences, and challenges in design. For example, the article on the AEG Turbine Factory touches on the somewhat contentious relationship between designer and engineer. Articles on architects zero in on the person's architectural career, describing major achievements, philosophy of design, and impact on the architectural community.\n\nAll articles are signed, and most end with a list of related topics as well as a list of suggested readings. The lack of Internet sites will disappoint some researchers. Articles on people often include a list of their selected works and publications.\n\nVolume 3 provides a cumulative subject index with main entries listed in bold. The 600 mostly black-and-white illustrations usually show exterior shots of buildings. The lack of detailed illustrations highlighting specific design features forces readers to rely on text descriptions, which the general reader might find challenging.\n\nThe international coverage of not only architects and buildings but also building materials, locations, movements, and other architectural topics distinguishes this resource from reference tools such as the Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of the World (Cambridge Univ., 1997) and the International Dictionary of Architects and Architecture (St. James, 1993). Recommended for large public libraries and academic libraries, especially those supporting architectural programs.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:908a5773ccf24131b99f0179f3b0ab2ffd890b33","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+20th-Century+Architecture%2C+Volume+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"908a5773ccf24131b99f0179f3b0ab2ffd890b33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,138,87,115,204,242,65,49,185,159,1,121,243,176,171,47,253,137,11,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
