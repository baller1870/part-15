And when Mr. Whitman has occasion to clout Mr. Wayne on the head with a spade, he does so with such violence that, if it were serious, the film would be over, then and there.\n\nSo it goes. Separated by expedience, brought together again by chance, these two roughnecks bang their way across Texas in a whirlwind of hyperboles. They play cut-throat poker in Sweetwater, where Mr. Wayne puts a couple of deadly slugs into a scalping-scarred, booze-sogged Lee Marvin, who gets so noisy he just has to be shot. In another place, Mr. Whitman is absolved of the murder charge by Circuit Judge Edgar Buchanan, who has an amiable way with the law.\n&quot;Ain't no way to do this legal and honest,&quot; Mr. Buchanan says, &quot;So, being good, sensible Texans, we gonna do it illegal and dishonest. Case dismissed.&quot;\n\nIndians are knocked off with a vengeance that could only be achieved through a careful collaboration of a wild director and stunt men with rubber for skin. Houses are burned, booze is guzzled and finally the two roughnecks arrive in the secret stronghold of the Comancheros, a band of white renegades, back in the hills.\n\nHere again seriousness and credibility are cheerfully tossed to the winds. You might think the Comancheros were sybarites at Montego Bay. Top Comanchero Nehemiah Persoff is an elegantly cultivated gent. His ward, Ina Balin, is a beauty right out of a finishing school. Fine wine and drunken Indians adorn their dining room. The Texas Rangers arrive to save our heroes just in the nick of time.\n\nSure, it is foolish and childish, meaningless and absurd, designed for no other evident purpose than to agitate and amuse. But, at least, it doesn't have the gross pretensions of such as &quot;The Alamo.&quot; Making it, under the direction of Michael Curtiz, must have been back-breaking fun.\n\nOne of the earlier examples of the genre which later became the buddy movie. There are plenty of rousing action setpieces to enjoy, while Wayne is as cool as ever.\n \nhe film turns out to be a better-than-average western epic with an unusual amount of humor interspersed with the usual gunfights, fist fights, trail rides, songs, card games, drinking and killings. It boasts a lot of talent in front of and behind the lens, with Academy Award-winning director Michael Curtiz (Ã¢â‚¬Å“CasablancaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) directing (in his final film), a top cinematographer in William H. Clothier, director of photography, and an Academy Award-winning musical composer, Elmer Bernstein. In addition to the legendary John Wayne, there is also another iconic Western actor in the film, Lee Marvin. Both Marvin and Wayne won best actor Academy Awards.\n \nThe Comancheros is a big, brash, uninhibited action-western of the old school about as subtle as a right to the jaw.Wayne is obviously comfortable in a role tailor-made to the specifications of his easygoing, square-shooting, tight-lipped but watch-out-when-IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m-mad screen personality. Lee Marvin makes a vivid impression in a brief, but colorful, role as a half-scalped, vile-tempered Comanchero agent.\n\nVIDEO\n\nSize.... 2.04gb\nDuration.... 01:47:23\nCodec.......
