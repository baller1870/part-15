The film is based on a story by Hal Goodman and Larry Klein and stars Yul Brynner, Janice Rule, George Segal, Alfred Ryder and Clifford David. \n \nNot a typical Western by any stretch of the imagination, Invitation to a Gunfighter (1964) is a psychological frontier drama with an unusual twist - the hired gun is a literate, highly educated gentleman of Creole ancestry with a hatred for whites.\n\nWhen Matt Weaver, a Confederate veteran, returns to his family home after the Civil War, he discovers that his property has been confiscated by the Yankees. Sam Brewster, the town leader, tries to intimidate Weaver into leaving the community but the former Rebel soldier refuses to give up his homestead. To remedy the situation, Brewster imports a professional gunslinger from Louisiana by the name of Jules Gaspard d'Estaing to kill Weaver. But the hired gunman has his own agenda and quickly becomes a bigger threat to the townspeople than Weaver.\n\nGood Western,however, if you expect pure action from a Western like blazing gunfights, barroom brawls, and cattle stampedes, Invitation to a Gunfighter is NOT for you. Sure, the film has the prerequisite shootouts and killings and violent confrontations. But the overall style of the movie is closer to a Eugene O'Neill drama than a six-gun oater like Dodge City (1939). After all, when was the last time you saw a feared gunfighter publicly best his rival - not in a showdown - but through a demeaning lesson in French pronunciation?\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 372mb\nDuration.... 01:28:57\nCodec.......
