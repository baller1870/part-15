According to the folks at Chemikal Underground, 5: 14 Fluoxytine Seagull Alcohol John Nicotine began as a Middleton home recording project before its fleshing out. But even with gentle percussion or the aforementioned synth squiggles, the album is still intensely personal -- Middleton's accented mumble is almost an aside to himself that listeners just happen to overhear. Sometimes, it's personal to the point of awkwardness. &quot;Where are you tonight?&quot; he wonders in the fragile &quot;Cold Winter.&quot; &quot;Why aren't you here?/You should be looking after me this winter/I sure as hell can't&quot; -- you want to jump a steamer to Scotland, or send in a St. Bernard with a cask of hot brandy. In &quot;Speed on the M9,&quot; he professes a desire to get into a fight just for the company, and &quot;Loneliest Night of My Life Came Calling&quot; is made even more achy when its swaying melody is picked up by a windstorm of keys and bittersweet fiddle. Fluoxytine bottoms out with &quot;Devil and the Angel.&quot; The first entity tells Middleton his &quot;songs are sh*te,&quot; while the second reassures with kind words. Which path will he choose? Given the self-defeat and sadness palpable in every stitch of the album, the angel might not stand a chance. Bonus demo tracks are included at the end of the album; there's also a short film from Arab Strap video director Martin Smith.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8059124ac11e92324775f18982dc6139cfdf4130","amp;dn":"Malcolm+Middleton+-+5%3A14+Fluoxytine+Seagull+Alcohol+John+Nicotin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8059124ac11e92324775f18982dc6139cfdf4130","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,89,18,74,193,30,146,50,71,117,241,137,130,220,97,57,207,223,65,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
