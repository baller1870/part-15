Vintage Rock chronicles all the stellar artists and music, the enduring legacy of those early pioneers - and why itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still the best way to live. Spanning the dawn of the 50s to early Beatles (pre Eastern mysticism!), Vintage Rock covers a time of Mods and Rockers, crinoline skirts and blue jeans, rock star movies and screaming-girl concerts. This special magazine rejoices in the music and verve of Elvis, The Shadows, Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Gene Vincent and a host more, and speaks to a contemporary audience that relishes the vitality and flair of the era.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b33c7fcfc7f55307224c9e4dcc0a6160956c3891","amp;dn":"Vintage+Rock+-+Winter+2013++UK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b33c7fcfc7f55307224c9e4dcc0a6160956c3891","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,60,127,207,199,245,83,7,34,76,158,77,204,10,97,96,149,108,56,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
