In this savage paradise where lawlessness and violence are\nthe only sure thing, players will dictate when, where and how the events\nof the game unfold\n\nNotes:\n\nDigital distribution of games is nothing new anymore. It's common in the\nPC Games scene for years already.And it doesn't really matter where you\nbought a game - online or in a physical store. The game will remain the\nsame. So we decided not to tag this release with PSN or anything else, even\nthough it's in a pkg format\nTo make it easier for those who use fat32 devices with their consoles, we\nmade 2 conventient packages for you as one pkg would have been too big\n\n\nIf you have problem in installation then visit source link\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb15b839856b852e6be6b6f452dd5475df37dbe0","amp;dn":"Far.Cry.3.PS3-DUPLEX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb15b839856b852e6be6b6f452dd5475df37dbe0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,21,184,57,133,107,133,46,107,230,182,244,82,221,84,117,223,55,219,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
