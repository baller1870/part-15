Kinsey's material ranged from deep blues in the Muddy Waters vein to hard-rocking blues with touches of funk and reggae, courtesy of sons Donald and Ralph. In the early 1990s Kinsey released one of the most successful albums of his career, I Am the Blues which featured contributions from Buddy Guy, James Cotton, Sugar Blue and Pinetop Perkins.\nHis three sons Donald, Ralph and Kenneth formed the contemporary blues band, The Kinsey Report, along with Ron Prince, in 1984. The Kinsey Report recorded and toured as his backing band until April 2001 when in Gary, Indiana he succumbed to prostate cancer, dying at the age of 74.]\n\n\nTracklist:\n01.
