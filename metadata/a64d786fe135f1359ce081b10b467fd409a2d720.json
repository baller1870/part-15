The two stated they knocked out eighteen tracks and Snoop ended the video out saying he gave him some gangsta tracks, some R&amp;B tracks and some Hip Hop tracks. [2][3]  Snoop Dogg called off plans to release the sequel to his classic debut Doggystyle, instead opting for the title Doggumentary Music for his 11th studio album, set for release in March 2011 on Priority/EMI Records. &quot;I have been in the game for so long and still have the same passion I did when I first started. I want my fans to ride with me on this one and know that I am so focused on bringing good music to them,&quot; explained the veteran MC. &quot;It's called Doggumentary Music because this is my life and I want to share my music, and my process of making it, with the fans.\n\nReleased.........: March 29, 2011\n\nRecorded.........: 2010ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£2011\n\nGenre............: Hip hop, Gangsta rap, Pop rap, West Coast hip hop, G-Funk\n\nLength...........: 79:44\n\nLabel............: Priority/Capitol/EMI Records\n\nProducer.........: Snoop Dogg (exec.), Jake One, Battlecat, DJ Khalil, Lex Luger, Kanye West, Fredwreck, the Cataracs, Scoop DeVille, Gorillaz, Mr. Porter, Warryn Campbell, David Banner, Meech Wells, Scott Storch, Willie Nelson\n__________________________________________________________________________\n\nSingles from Doggumentary\n\n   1. &quot;Wet&quot;\n      Released: December 17, 2010\n   2. &quot;Boom&quot;\n      Released: March 8, 2011\n\n===========================================================================\n\nTrack List:\n\n1.
