Perhaps most touching in this episode is the extended portrait of the troubled, white cornet player, Bix Beiderbecke, whose family disapproved of his chosen profession, and who would never be allowed to record with greats like Louis Armstrong due to segregation in the music business. \nJazz continually relates issues of race both heartening and harrowing. Episode 3, &quot;Our Language,&quot; tells the story of the Empress of the Blues, Bessie Smith. While performing in a Southern local, one of her musicians informed her that several members of the Klan were descending upon the tent show. Smith, no pushover, stormed out to meet themÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½shaking her fist. &quot;IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll get the whole damned tent out here. You just pick up them sheets and run!&quot; They left. Other stories prove more disturbing. While performing in a downtown club, Miles Davis decided to go outside during a break. A white police officer asked him to move along. When Davis refused, explaining that he was working at the club, the officer beat him bloody. In 1957, Louis Armstrong had been asked by the State Department to go on a goodwill tour of Russia. When Eisenhower did little to stop the violence surrounding desegregation at Little Rock Central High School, Armstrong refused to go on the tour.\n\nCredits\nKen BurnsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Director/Producer/Cinematography\nLynn Novick--Producer\nGeoffrey C.
