In the past 10 years, the orchid industry has been growing substantially worldwide. This interesting book focuses on the recent advances in orchid biotechnology research since the last 10 years in Taiwan. To advance the orchid industry, enhancement of basic research as well as advanced biotechnology will provide a good platform to improve the flower quality and breeding of new varieties. Important topics covered include the new knowledge of basic genome, through floral morphogenesis, floral ontology, embryogenesis, micropropagation, to functional genomics such as EST, virus-induced gene silencing, and genetic transformation.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 276 pages\n    * Publisher: World Scientific Publishing Company; 1 edition (July 27, 2007)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 9812706194","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44b3fa9ba631e5a98f419ef22e3f19752f54b2d9","amp;dn":"Orchid+Biotechnology%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44b3fa9ba631e5a98f419ef22e3f19752f54b2d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,179,250,155,166,49,229,169,143,65,158,242,46,63,25,117,47,84,178,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
