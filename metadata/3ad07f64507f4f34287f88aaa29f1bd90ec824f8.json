It looks like fantastic scenery, so you'll definitely want to check it out.  \n\nIt's the original installer- no rip here, so just install and you're good to go.\n\nI don't take credit for this- only for uploading it here on TPB.  Credit goes to those wonderful folks over at FSWC.  \n\nNow if we could only get FsP X, then life would be complete....  haha.  Okay, maybe that and the FS DreamTeam stuff...  \n\nAnyway- enjoy the scenery....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ad07f64507f4f34287f88aaa29f1bd90ec824f8","amp;dn":"FSX+-+FTX+-+Orbx+-+Australia+Red","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ad07f64507f4f34287f88aaa29f1bd90ec824f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,208,127,100,80,127,79,52,40,127,136,170,162,159,27,217,14,200,36,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
