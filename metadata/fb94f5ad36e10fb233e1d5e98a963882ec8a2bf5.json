Bob Godfrey presents the Do It Yourself Film Animation Show.\n\nTerry Gilliam demonstrates his own cutout animation method in great detail. The format of the show matches Gilliam's own anarchic sensibilities and Godfrey has created some original animation to match.\n\nQuality is good, high quality VHSlike, PAL, with a timecode at upper left.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb94f5ad36e10fb233e1d5e98a963882ec8a2bf5","amp;dn":"Terry+Gilliam%5C%27s+Do+It+Yourself+Film+Animation+Show+%5BBob+Godfrey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb94f5ad36e10fb233e1d5e98a963882ec8a2bf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,148,245,173,54,225,15,178,51,225,213,233,138,150,56,130,236,138,43,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
