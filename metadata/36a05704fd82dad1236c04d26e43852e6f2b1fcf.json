Run debuted with 1,190,380 copies sold in its first week and over 2,196,660 copies sold in total.\n\nThe album continues the band's change in direction from a synthesizer-heavy band to a more guitar-oriented band. A full horn section replaced the synth brass backing, and electric organ was used more extensively. The resulting sound was not unlike many American bands, particularly Aerosmith, one of lead singer Koshi Inaba's inspirations.\n\nOnly one single, &quot;Zero,&quot; was released.\nTrack listing\n\n    The Gambler\n    Zero\n    Akai Kagerou\n    Run\n    Out Of Control\n    Native Dance\n    Mr. Rolling Thunder\n    Sayonara Nanka wa Iwasenai\n    Gekkou\n    Baby, You're My Home\n\n\n\nAll ripped by me from the original CD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36a05704fd82dad1236c04d26e43852e6f2b1fcf","amp;dn":"B%27z+-+Run+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36a05704fd82dad1236c04d26e43852e6f2b1fcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,160,87,4,253,130,218,209,35,108,4,210,110,67,133,46,111,43,31,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
