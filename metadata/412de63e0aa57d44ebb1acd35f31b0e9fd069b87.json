She believes that by shedding our armor, we can stop hiding, competing, striving for the mirage of perfection, and making motherhood, marriage, and friendship harder by pretending theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not hard. In this one woman trying to love herself and others, readers find a wise and witty friend who will inspire them to forgive their own imperfections, make the most of their gifts, and commit to small acts of love that will change the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:412de63e0aa57d44ebb1acd35f31b0e9fd069b87","amp;dn":"Carry+On%2C+Warrior+-+Glennon+Melton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"412de63e0aa57d44ebb1acd35f31b0e9fd069b87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,45,230,62,10,165,125,68,235,177,172,211,95,49,176,233,253,6,155,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
