In his preface, PrixGoncourt-winning writer Yann QueffÃƒÂ©lec recalls the sea's &quot;perpetual,static velocity,&quot; and these overwhelming photographs-400 in all-are atestament to that paradox. Some portray human interaction with theocean: fisherman casting their lines from a craggy jetty; wavescrashing over a railing, soaking onlookers; hundreds ofpleasure-seekers wading into the water's edge on a summer day.\n\nOthersdepict the sea's vast and mottled surface, with nary a ship insight. The book's design, which positions all the captions at the end,allows readers to be swept up by the remarkable images. Some photosare panoramas, spanning four fold-out pages. From Portugal toPolynesia, Plisson succeeds in documenting the sea's tremendouspresence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cad541945fcc2d29548befa8de5040fbac37e16e","amp;dn":"The+Sea+-+day+by+day+%28Photography%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cad541945fcc2d29548befa8de5040fbac37e16e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,213,65,148,95,204,45,41,84,139,239,168,222,80,64,251,172,55,225,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
