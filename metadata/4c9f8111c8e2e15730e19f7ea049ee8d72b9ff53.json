Simplify Your Electronic Life by Eric Taub\n\n\nFormat: mobi/epub/azw3\nLength: 192 pages\nGenre: Non-Fiction/Electronics\nDate: 6 January 2014\n\nThe first really easy-to-use consumer guide to buying, installing, and using electronic gadgetry including HDTVs and home networks, tablets, smart phones, MP3 players, GPS systems, car electronics and more, for you and me, not geeks! \n\nSmartphone, router, Blu-ray, LED--America's use of electronics has gotten increasingly more challenging since the invention of the light bulb. If you don't know how many pixels your HDTV should contain for maximum viewing pleasure, or if you are ready to throw your hands up when you hear that you have to configure your Internet router using the WPA-PSK (TKIP) or WPA-PSK (TKIP) + WPA2-PSK (AES) security protocols, then you need Eric Taub's Does This Plug Into That?\n\nTaub ignores the jargon and demystifies the technology that can make our lives easier, but usually leaves us bewildered, flummoxed, and defeated--especially after consulting the manufacturer's installation and usage instructions. Does This Plug into That? cracks the geek code and offers practical advice and directions for everything from purchasing a new TV, to setting up a Web connection, installing a home network, and more. Does This Plug Into That? is the all-inclusive resource that will make you smarter than your smartphone while enhancing your gadgetry and electronic prowess.\n\nAuthor:\n\nEric Taub is a leading technology consultant for Apple, IBM, Microsoft, and more. A consumer technology writer for the New York Times, he is one of the co-founders of the Times's famed Circuits section. Taub has written hundreds of articles that take 'arcane, esoteric, technical subjects and turn them into work that both educates and entertains'.
