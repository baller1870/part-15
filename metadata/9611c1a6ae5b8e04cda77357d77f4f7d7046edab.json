Nothing is more fundamental than human thinking. Nothing is more important than human thinking. Why has human thinking been so successful in science and technology yet so unsuccessful in human affairs? Is it really possible to change human thinking in a way that is significant, practical, effective and simple?&quot; Dr Edward de Bono\nProduct Description\nIn Why So Stupid? How the Human Race has Never Really Learned to Think, Dr Edward de Bono acknowledges the excellence of the thinking system provided by the Renaissance but maintains that it is not enough. He says that we have become too complacent with a system that is dangerously inadequate in some areas. That this system is so enshrined in society will make change more difficult - but more necessary. Dr de Bono outlines new thinking methods. He challenges us to open our minds to the potential of these methods and provides concrete examples of the remarkable results they achieve in practice. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Why-So-Stupid-Really-Learned/dp/1842180509/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1306522253&amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Why-So-Stupid-Really-Learned/dp/1842180509/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1306522253&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9611c1a6ae5b8e04cda77357d77f4f7d7046edab","amp;dn":"Why+So+Stupid%3F%3A+How+the+Human+Race+Has+Never+Really+Learned+to+T","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9611c1a6ae5b8e04cda77357d77f4f7d7046edab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,17,193,166,174,91,142,4,205,167,115,87,215,127,79,125,112,70,237,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
