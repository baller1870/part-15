When young attorney Jeffrey Rutherford's brother is killed in a plane crash minutes after takeoff from JFK, his life is turned upside down - especially when he discovers that his brother's career wasn't what it seemed. Jeffrey's staid existence is upended as he races to unravel a Gordian knot of deceit and betrayal, and ultimately must battle an unstoppable adversary bent on systematic global genocide.\n\n(sb request)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2205fa9dee53716b766743fe78052cc553e0643c","amp;dn":"Upon+a+Pale+Horse+-+Russell+Blake","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2205fa9dee53716b766743fe78052cc553e0643c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,5,250,157,238,83,113,107,118,103,67,254,120,5,44,197,83,224,100,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
