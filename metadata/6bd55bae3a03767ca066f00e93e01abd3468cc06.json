Originally released in 1965 and continues to be revered and praised The All Seeing Eye featured an incredible line up of young talent that would turn into legends of the jazz scene. The title track and &quot;Genesis&quot; being standouts from the session; but also the album features Wayne Shorter's brother Alan on flugelhorn on the phenomenal final track &quot;Mephistopheles.&quot; The piece was also written by Alan. The All Seeing Eye was another of a large selection of albums Shorter would record in a short and highly prolific time period.\n\n\n With such titles as &quot;The All Seeing Eye,&quot; &quot;Genesis,&quot; &quot;Chaos,&quot; &quot;Face of the Deep,&quot; and &quot;Mephistopheles,&quot; it is clear from the start that the music on this album is not basic bop and blues. Wayne Shorter (who composed four of the five originals) picked an all-star cast (trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, altoist James Spaulding, trombonist Grachan Moncur III, pianist Herbie Hancock, bassist Ron Carter, and drummer Joe Chambers, along with brother Alan Shorter on flÃƒÂ¼gelhorn for the final song) to perform and interpret the dramatic selections, and their brand of controlled freedom has plenty of subtle surprises. This is stimulating music that still sounds fresh over three decades later.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - The All Seeing Eye\n 02 - Genesis\n 03 - Chaos\n 04 - Face Of The Deep\n 05 - Mephistopheles\n\n Produced by Alfred Lion.\n Recorded October 15, 1965 in Rudy Van Gelder Studio, Englewood Cliffs, NJ.\n\nMusicians:\n Wayne Shorter - tenor saxophone\n Freddie Hubbard - trumpet, flugelhorn\n Alan Shorter - flugelhorn\n Grachan Moncur III - trombone\n James Spaulding - alto saxophone\n Herbie Hancock - piano\n Ron Carter - bass\n Joe Chambers - drums\n\n\n In preparing these hi def remasters, we were very conscientious about maintaining the feel of the original releases while adding a previously unattainable transparency and depth. It now sounds like you've set up your chaise lounge right in the middle of Rudy Van Gelder's studio!&quot; -- Blue Note President, Don Was","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bd55bae3a03767ca066f00e93e01abd3468cc06","amp;dn":"Wayne+Shorter+-+The+All+Seeing+Eye+%281965%29+HDTracks+24-192","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bd55bae3a03767ca066f00e93e01abd3468cc06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,213,91,174,58,3,118,124,160,102,240,14,147,224,26,189,52,104,204,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
