Over the years the Ashampoo \n\nprogrammers have turned the program into a full suite that can handle all your data, audio \n\nand video burning and authoring tasks, without sacrificing its famous ease of use. In \n\nversion 10 they have once again added a wealth of new features and modules, but the program \n\nis still amazingly intuitive to use ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ everything is explained as you do it. The main focus \n\nof this premium version is even better authoring capabilities for building video and audio \n\ndiscs using the latest formats. HD and Full HD video (720p and 1080p) are now fully \n\nsupported for Blu-ray discs, and all the encoding is handled by Ashampoo Burning Studio. All \n\nthe authoring tools have been overhauled and the video encoding quality is even better than \n\nbefore. You now use the same new integrated editor for building DVD and Blu-ray video disks \n\nwith menus. The program also starts more quickly and is generally snappier to use. In \n\naddition to this there is a new Autoplay Editor module with which you can build \n\nauto-starting data discs with attractive interactive menus ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ for example for collections of \n\nprograms. And there is now also a new Audio Player with which you can play audio files and \n\naudio CDs without leaving the program.\n\nFeatures:\n- Burn and update data to CD, DVD or Blu-ray discs\n- Back up your data to single or multiple discs\n- Rip music from CDs and burn music to audio CDs and MP3 or WMA discs\n- Burn movies and photos to DVDs and data discs\n- Movie editor with DVD authoring\n- Create high-quality DVD slideshows\n- Copy CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray discs\n- Create and burn disc images\n- Quick and easy erase rewriteable discs\n- Expert burn functions for full control\n- Create covers and labels","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f679de1d6c4a0fa664259158672eb676fcecaa40","amp;dn":"Ashampoo+Burning+Studio+2012+v10.0.15+Multilang","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f679de1d6c4a0fa664259158672eb676fcecaa40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,121,222,29,108,74,15,166,100,37,145,88,103,46,182,118,252,236,170,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
