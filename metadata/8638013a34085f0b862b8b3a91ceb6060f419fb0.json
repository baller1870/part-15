Text replaced, paragraphs moved together, format A4 in single column.\n\nFrom the book introduction;\nThe accompanying description of the methods used at the Springfield Armory in manufacturing the Springfield, 1903 Model Service Rifle was undertaken at the request of the Ordnance Bureau of the United States Army for the purpose of assisting manufacturers in undertaking large contracts for this arm should necessity arise. The immediate necessity arrived before this plan could be carried out, but as the Springfield still remains the standard arm of the United States Army, the work remains of value for the future. The methods shown are those in use during the fall of 1916, some of these being since modified in accordance with manufacturing requirements.\nIt is believed that this is the first instance of such an amount of detailed information being gathered into such a small compass where it is so readily available for use. The perspective drawings of operations are all from photographs, over 1000 being taken for this purpose.\nWhile this was secured primarily for its value to makers of military rifles, it is hoped and believed that it will be found useful to other manufacturers making parts which in some way resemble those shown. Some of the uses of the profiler and miller should be available in other classes of manufacture.\nWe have also included the descriptions of the operation and mechanisms of the modified Enfield, the United States Machine Rifle, the Lewis Machine Gun, and the Vickers Machine Gun.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8638013a34085f0b862b8b3a91ceb6060f419fb0","amp;dn":"United+States+Rifles+And+Machine+Guns+-+F+H+Colvin+-+1917.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8638013a34085f0b862b8b3a91ceb6060f419fb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,56,1,58,52,8,95,11,134,43,139,58,145,206,182,6,15,65,159,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
