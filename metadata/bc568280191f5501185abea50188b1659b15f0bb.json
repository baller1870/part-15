The field emerged from its mathematical roots some forty-years ago through work in computer-based imaging, and it is used today in many fields, such as digital image processing and analysis (with applications in medical imaging, pattern recognition, and robotics) and of course computer graphics. Digital Geometry is the first book to detail the concepts, algorithms, and practices of the discipline. This comphrehensive text and reference provides an introduction to the mathematical foundations of digital geometry, some of which date back to ancient times, and also discusses the key processes involved, such as geometric algorithms as well as operations on pictures.\n\n*A comprehensive text and reference written by pioneers in digital geometry, image processing and analysis, and computer vision\n*Provides a collection of state-of-the-art algorithms for a wide variety of geometrical picture analysis tasks, including extracting data from digital images and making geometric measurements on the data\n*Includes exercises, examples, and references to related or more advanced work.\n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc568280191f5501185abea50188b1659b15f0bb","amp;dn":"Digital+Geometry+Geometric+Methods+for+Digital+Image+Analysis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc568280191f5501185abea50188b1659b15f0bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,86,130,128,25,31,85,1,24,90,190,165,1,136,177,101,155,21,240,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
