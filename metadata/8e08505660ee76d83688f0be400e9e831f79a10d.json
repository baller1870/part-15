This release sounds absolutely awesome.\n Delivering a sound that you come to expect is nothing but first rate. Drums bring the thunder that feels like a 100 tons of crushing cinder blocks.\n\n Guitars blaze like molten metal and incinerate everything its path. Bass guitar work holds down the low-end and help give Blindside Thunder their trademark sound. Vocal work on this release really rise to the occasion and give the music a run for its money.\n\n John really seems to have stepped up his game on this album and leaped a couple levels in his vocal delivery. Rather than fill an album with a couple of good songs and a bunch of filler, BT has crafted a disc with eight tracks that rock.\n One stand out track is, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Take My Breath AwayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with its true swagger and sex appeal.\n This is the type of album that you want to put on and have a good time. Blindside Thunder have a great talent for writing party anthems that make you want to throw back a few cold ones and grab your girl.\n The opening of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rebel RevolutionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has a really cool crawling vibe that helps unfold a track that is a call to arms and makes you want to join the Blindside Army.\n From the opening grind of guitars in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rock nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Roll JunkieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to blazing leads in Ã¢â‚¬Å“BurnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Blindside Thunder delivers again and again.\n\n If you are a fan of Hard Rock/Heavy Metal then I would highly recommend checking out this album because it delivers 100% of the time with pure 100 Proof.\n\t\n01 - Rock 'n' Roll Junkie.mp3\t10.6 MB\n\t02 - Bad Reputation.mp3\t8 MB\n\t03 - Tequila.mp3\t9.6 MB\n\t04 - Take My Breath Away.mp3\t9.3 MB\n\t05 - Daddy's Farm.mp3\t11.4 MB\n\t06 - Rebel Revolution.mp3\t10.7 MB\n\t07 - Human Race.mp3\t9.3 MB\n\t08 - Burn.mp3\t10.6 MB\n\nParty!!!!\n\nJohn E.
