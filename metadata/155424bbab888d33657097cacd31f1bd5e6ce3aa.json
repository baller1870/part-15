He lived in Kentish Town and went to school at the Acland Burghley Secondary Modern at Tufnell Park. He had his first Number One hit in 1968, when he was the lead guitarist and main songwriter of the multiracial group The Equals, with his self-penned song &quot;Baby Come Back&quot;. The tune also later topped the UK Single Chart again when covered by Pato Banton. Notably, he openly used his songwriting for political purposes, especially against the then-current apartheid regime of Sout Africa. The Clash recorded a version of &quot;Police On My Back&quot; for their Sandinista! set.\n\nEddy Grant stands among an elite group of artists as one who has not just merely moved successfully across the musical spectrum, but has actually been at the forefront of genres and even created one of his own. From pop star to reggae radical, musical entrepreneur to the inventor of ringbang, the artist has cut a swath through the world of music and made it his own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01. I Don't Wanna Dance\n02.
