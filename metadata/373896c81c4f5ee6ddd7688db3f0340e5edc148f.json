Though it is her wedding night, she decides not to consummate the union and so ends up hiding in the room of a fellow whose airplane cargo company is facing financial ruin. He assumes that the frightened girl is poor and homeless and so takes her in. She then overdoses on sleeping pills and cannot wake up. The fellow is forced to take her back to California. The flight back is tumultuous as she, a fugitive criminal, two enamored newlyweds, a cigar smoking chimp, a corpse, and a shipment of lobsters are aboard the plane. Mayhem really ensues when the plane crashes in a farmer's field. By this time, the woman and the fellow have fallen in love.\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040982/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040982/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nSpan subs:\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3598443/you-gotta-stay-happy-es&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3598443/you-gotta-stay-happy-es&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nDirector:\nH.C.
