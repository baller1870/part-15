In the second season, Mannix opened his own agency, with police widow Peggy Fair working for him as his secretary. Each episode featured plenty of fistfights, car chases and shootouts. \n\nEnjoy the show, and thanks for choosing cOOt torrents.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83c611be82f4043756c745d13f22599e9e0629ec","amp;dn":"Mannix+-+Season+1+%5BDVDRip%5D+-+cOOt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83c611be82f4043756c745d13f22599e9e0629ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,198,17,190,130,244,4,55,86,199,69,209,63,34,89,158,158,6,41,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
