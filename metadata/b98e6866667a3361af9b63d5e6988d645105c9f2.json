Author Adam Crespi starts with a gas station taken from a photographÃ¢â‚¬â€retrieving measurements and dimensions with modular blocking and planning techniques in Adobe PhotoshopÃ¢â‚¬â€and then re-creates the building in Maya with polygonal modeling and advanced texturing techniques. The course shows how to model elements such as walls, doors, and roofs, including stacking UVs on a texture sheet, and also sheds light on simulating real-world details like dirt, wear, and grime, using ambient occlusion and normal baking in a high- to low-poly workflow. The final chapter shows how to export the model to the Unity gaming engine for final cleanup and rendering.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b98e6866667a3361af9b63d5e6988d645105c9f2","amp;dn":"Creating+Game+Environments+in+Maya+and+Photoshop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b98e6866667a3361af9b63d5e6988d645105c9f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,142,104,102,102,122,51,97,175,155,99,213,230,152,141,100,81,5,201,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
