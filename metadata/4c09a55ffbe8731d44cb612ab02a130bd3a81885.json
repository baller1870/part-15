Not only is its fare local, seasonal, organic, and sustainable, but also so flavorful and satisfying that customersÃ¢â‚¬â€vegan and omnivore alikeÃ¢â‚¬â€are constantly asking for recipes to cook at home. This collection answers that call, with simple yet impressive recipes for Chickpea Crepes, Ginger-Seitan Dumplings, Live Lasagna, Chocolate Mousse Towers, Cucumber-Basil Martinis, and more. Expanding the horizons of vegan fare with appetizers, soups, salads, mains, brunches, desserts, cocktails, and wine pairings, Candle 79 Cookbook invites every home cook to make truly green cuisine.\n\nCandle 79 is one of the most highly rated vegan restaurants in the country and this book presents many of their recipes. Included are; amuse-bouches, appetizers, soups, salads, entrees, sides, sauces, desserts, brunch, and drinks. There are lovely pictures of most of the recipes - they will make them appealing to even a confirmed carnivore.\nThese are not the easiest dishes to prepare, mainly because of a lot of chopping and number of ingredients - but most of the time that includes many spices to add the very good taste that is achieved. The preparation is not difficult, not even for novice cooks, it just can be labor and or time intensive; because of that I wish they would have included an estimated prep time.\n\nThe best sections of recipes are the sides, which would add interest to almost any meal and the drinks were magnificent. We have already tried the heirloom tomato-avocado tartare, the spinach-mushroom pate, and the seaweed salad with ginger-sesame dressing. Live lasagna is an interesting dish, but quite first-rate and we can never fix enough pomegranate cosmos (and they are very easy to prepare)\nThere is a glossary and resources are listed with phone numbers and web sites. An index is included.\nThis can be the cookbook that will prove that vegan recipes are tasty and definitely not boring.\n\nCONTENTS\nForeword\nIntroduction\nAmuse-Bouches and Appetizers\nSoups\nSalads\nEntrees\nSides, Sauces, and Secrets\nBrunch\nDesserts\nDrinks\nGlossary\nResources\nAcknowledgments\nAbout the Authors\nIndex\nMeasurement Conversion Charts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c09a55ffbe8731d44cb612ab02a130bd3a81885","amp;dn":"Candle+79+Cookbook+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c09a55ffbe8731d44cb612ab02a130bd3a81885","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,9,165,95,251,232,115,29,68,203,97,42,176,42,19,11,211,168,24,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
