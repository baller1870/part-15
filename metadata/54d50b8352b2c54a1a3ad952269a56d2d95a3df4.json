They're going to attempt to transform the driving habits of two British motorists whose terrible driving is putting both themselves and the public at risk. They've been nominated by their families who believe they are accidents waiting to happen, so Dom and Cherry enrol of the help of one the UK's most experienced driving instructors' tackle their ingrained faults in new and surprising ways.\nElsewhere in the show, Dom reveals the real dangers of bad driving when he joins the East Midlands Serious Collision Investigation Unit to discover how they bring criminal drivers to justice, and Cherry learns the truth about the serious risks we all run when we use our mobile phones in the car.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;571f3e303f171b637966&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 2500 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 59mins\n * Framerate: 25FPS\n * Number of Parts: 1\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: average 1.08 GB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\nRelease Notes\nMerged Subtitles\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54d50b8352b2c54a1a3ad952269a56d2d95a3df4","amp;dn":"BBC.So.You.Think.You.Can.Drive.720p.HDTV.x264.AAC..mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54d50b8352b2c54a1a3ad952269a56d2d95a3df4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,213,11,131,82,178,197,74,26,58,217,82,38,154,86,210,217,90,61,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
