One of ten adventures in The Bane Chronicles.\n\nMagnus thought he would never return to London, but he is lured by a handsome offer from Tatiana Blackthorn, whose plansÃ¢â‚¬â€involving her beautiful young wardÃ¢â‚¬â€are far more sinister than Magnus even suspects. In London at the turn of the century, Magnus finds old friends, and meets a very surprising young man...the sixteen-year-old James Herondale.\n\nThis standalone e-only short story illuminates the life of the enigmatic Magnus Bane, whose alluring personality populates the pages of the #1 New York Times bestselling series The Mortal Instruments and The Infernal Devices. This story in The Bane Chronicles, The Midnight Heir, is written by Cassandra Clare and Sarah Rees Brennan.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a73814847c6b383bfa75d472e6b8bf4e78ff7438","amp;dn":"Clare_Cassandra-Midnight_Heir_The.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a73814847c6b383bfa75d472e6b8bf4e78ff7438","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,56,20,132,124,107,56,59,250,117,212,114,230,184,191,78,120,255,116,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
