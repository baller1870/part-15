This two-CD set compiles all of three separate albums,\nincluding Quest II, Quest III: Midpoint/Double Edge (a duo CD by Liebman and\nBeirach), with bassist Ron McClure and drummer Billy Hart ably assisting on the\nfirst two sessions. The six tracks from Quest II, recorded in the studio, open\nthe first disc. Beirach's &quot;Gargoyles&quot; is pensive with an unpredictable path,\nnever relenting from its brooding, mysterious setting. His &quot;Pendulum&quot; is a\ndaunting modal work fired by Hart's explosive drumming and Liebman's searing\nsoprano. Liebman's eerie ballad &quot;Carrisma&quot; and intense &quot;Third Visit&quot; provoke\nsome of the quartet's best performances. Midpoint was recorded in concert over\ntwo nights in 1987 at the Montmartre in Copenhagen. The music encompasses\ncompositions by each member of the quartet. Liebman's &quot;The Code's Secretcode&quot; is\nan extended work with progressively different sections, taking the listener on a\ndelightful journey. Beirach's &quot;The Snow Leopard&quot; begins with a rapidly darting\npost-bop theme, and segues into avant-garde which leads into a dramatic feature\nfor Hart. plus a recap of the theme. McClure's &quot;Midpoint&quot; is a showcase for the\nbassist, playing its moody theme with soft backing from Beirach, with Hart's\nlater brushwork and Liebman's haunting soprano rounding it out. Hart's turbulent\n&quot;Redemption&quot; proves to be a very satisfying finale.\n\nThe duo selections are all familiar songs, though Liebman and Beirach present\nthem with novel interpretations. Choosing two John Coltrane works, they detour\nquickly from the familiar theme of &quot;Naima,&quot; giving it a more plaintive air,\nwhile Beirach's strumming and picking of the piano strings adds a surprising\nintroduction to their driving, dramatic rendition of &quot;India.&quot; Sandwiched between\nthem is a searing performance of &quot;'Round Midnight&quot; that is far from the usual\ndeliberate, spacious arrangement of this frequently recorded jazz\nstandard. Their setting of &quot;On Green Dolphin Street&quot; sticks to a straight-ahead\npath instead of the familiar changes throughout each chorus. Beirach's\ninterpretation of Leonard Bernstein's &quot;Some Other Time&quot; can't help but be\ninfluenced by Bill Evans' famous recording, with Liebman making a delayed\nentrance, adding a bit of mystery with his offbeat flute. There are plenty of\nfireworks and a darting run through Sonny Rollins' &quot;Oleo,&quot; where the musicians\nnever get around to its theme until the conclusion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dbda0bcb9629c675863a43bdbbd405344b79895","amp;dn":"Quest+-+Searching+For+The+New+Sound+Of+Be-Bop+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dbda0bcb9629c675863a43bdbbd405344b79895","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,189,160,188,185,98,156,103,88,99,164,59,219,189,64,83,68,183,152,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
