For decades, he was a notoriously-successful freelance direct-response copywriter with a global reputation for creating ads that brought home the bacon in almost every possible media (particularly direct mail, magazines and newspapers).

You start here, and the greatest adventure of your life can finally begin in earnest.\n\nAbout the author:\n\nJohn CarltonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s notorious 30-year career has become something of a legend among modern marketers. Just some of the highlights:\n\nHe started out as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“bad boyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ freelance copywriter snuck through the back doors of Los Angeles advertising agencies to do the hard-core sales jobs their staff writers couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t pull off (because they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand street-level salesmanship)Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nHe penned game-changing packages for the largest direct response mailers in the world (like Rodale Press)Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ while single-handedly also completely transforming the way print ads worked in a number of markets (through sizzling long-copy ads the magazine owners hated, but which worked like crazy)Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nAnd he pioneered the now-common use of killer Ã¢â‚¬Å“old schoolÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ persuasive ad-writing models for online markets when the Web finally became a viable vehicle for entrepreneurs.\n\nJohnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been called Ã¢â‚¬Å“the most respected and ripped-off copywriting wizard aliveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, because so many of his ads are still used as templates by other marketers. (Yes, even the ads written before the Web became a viable marketing medium.)\n\nAnd for over a decade now, John has been the Ã¢â‚¬Å“go-to-teacherÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for helping entrepreneurs learn how to craft ads that get results. His first book, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kick-Ass Copywriting Secrets of a Marketing RebelÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, is still cited as a primary resource by the best writers working today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccc53169d1f865c7faa21a1997d478b09aa88c77","amp;dn":"THE+ENTREPENEUR%27S+GUIDE+TO+GETTING+YOUR+SGETHER+-+John+Carlton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccc53169d1f865c7faa21a1997d478b09aa88c77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,197,49,105,209,248,101,199,250,162,26,25,151,212,120,176,154,168,140,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
