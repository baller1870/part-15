In The Slave Next Door we find that slaves are all around us, hidden in plain sight: the dishwasher in the kitchen of the neighborhood restaurant, the kids on the corner selling cheap trinkets, the man sweeping the floor of the local department store. In these pages we also meet some unexpected slaveholders, such as a 27-year old middle-class Texas housewife who is currently serving a life sentence for offences including slavery. Weaving together a wealth of voicesÃ¢â‚¬â€from slaves, slaveholders, and traffickers as well as from experts, counselors, law enforcement officers, rescue and support groups, and othersÃ¢â‚¬â€this book is also a call to action, telling what we, as private citizens, can do to finally bring an end to this horrific crime.\n\n\nEditorial Reviews \n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\nAlthough most people imagine widespread enslavement only in the historical past, human trafficking continues to exist today in myriad forms around the world. In this informative call to action, Bales (Disposable People), sociologist and president of Free the Slaves, and Soodalter (Hanging Captain Gordon), a historian, document routine coercive slave labor in domestic service, prostitution, farm labor, factories, light industry, prisons and mining operations. While many sensational cases have been well publicized, the authors demonstrate that slavery exists in mundane and unexpected forms. Their case studies begin in an American suburb and traverse the globe to urban China and rural Ghana, returning to Los Angeles, Calif., and East Orange, N.J., just a few of 100-plus documented cases in the U.S. The second half of the book focuses on causes and solutions, with a helpful emphasis on how ordinary individuals can recognize and report coercive situations, creating a humane and helpful primer on how to sever the links that create and hide human bondage.

Bales exposed how modern slavery penetrates the global economy in his Pulitzer-nominated book, Disposable People: New Slavery in the Global Economy. The film based on this book, Slavery: A Global Investigation (TrueVision), which he co-wrote for HBO and Channel 4, won a Peabody Award and two Emmys. His book also inspired a project undertaken by seven Magnum photographers, which he helped to design and write, entitled Documenting Disposable People: Contemporary Global Slavery, which was mounted as a touring exhibition and published as a book by Hayward. Scientific American published his findings as a 9-page fully illustrated feature story. Bales was named as the originator of one of &quot;100 World-Changing Discoveries&quot; by the Association of British Universities and as a &quot;visionary who is changing your world&quot; by Utne Reader. Disposable People went on to publication in ten other languages and won the Premio Viareggio for the Italian edition.\n\nIn 2001 he co-founded Free the Slaves, the American sister-organization of the UK's Anti-Slavery International, the world's oldest human rights group. In ten years it has helped to liberate thousands of slaves in India, Nepal, Haiti, Ghana, Brazil, Ivory Coast, and Bangladesh, and work with them to build new lives of dignity. After reading Bales' book Ending Slavery, President Clinton told the plenary of the Clinton Global Initiative: &quot;It tells you that it is a problem we can solve and here's how to do it.&quot; Ending Slavery won the 2011 $100,000 Grawemeyer Award for Ideas Promoting World Order. In 2008, with Zoe Trodd, he published To Plead Our Own Cause: Personal Stories by Today's Slaves. In 2009, with Ron Soodalter, he published The Slave Next Door: Human Trafficking and Slavery in America Today, an expose and plan to make America slave-free for the first time in its history. He is currently writing a book on the relationship between slavery and environmental destruction, and with Jody Sarich a book on forced marriage. He gained his Ph.D. at the London School of Economics.\n\n\nPaperback: 336 pages\nPublisher: University of California Press; With a New Preface edition (August 23, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0520268660\nISBN-13: 978-0520268661\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Slave-Next-Door-Trafficking/dp/0520268660/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Slave-Next-Door-Trafficking/dp/0520268660/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nTags: slave, slavery, oppression, bondage, servitude, indentured servitude, chattel, economic, mule, narcotic, narco, cocoa, cocaine, coffee, debt, strawberry, farm, labor, economics, human, trafficking, traffic, slavetrade, slaver, au pair, domestic, worker, work, nanny, maid, chain, detain, bondage, restrain, Phillipines, Saudi Arabia, Australia, United States, India, Africa, white slave, sex, prostitution, gang, gans, mob, mafia, OC, organized crime, political, science, criminal, justice, UN, Human, rights, woman, women, kidnap, drug, drugs, forced, addiction, whore, whoring, forced prostitution, human ring, business, businessmen, buy, buyer, brothel, hooker, Russia, PRC, Japan,DHS, mexico, mexican, latin, latino, south, dixie, cotton, invisible, hand, middle, passage, golden, triangle,extort,extortion,blackmail, \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e22f3fee492ce5a66329d6b3b14a78ec277ec020","amp;dn":"The+Slave+Next+Door%3A+Human+Trafficking+and+Slavery+in+America+To","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e22f3fee492ce5a66329d6b3b14a78ec277ec020","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,47,63,238,73,44,229,166,99,41,214,179,177,74,120,236,39,126,192,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
