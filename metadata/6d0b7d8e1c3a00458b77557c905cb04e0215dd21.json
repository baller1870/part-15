This vast region is a study in contrasts: a hub of industry thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the resting spot for billions of migrating birds. 40 million residents, immense untamed forests. 95 percent of North AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fresh water and a dumping ground for poisonous wastes. The Great Lakes is an authoritative, accessible look at an ecosystem in eternal flux. Written by one of North AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most acclaimed science and nature writers, the book explores the areaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s geological formation and its role in human history; its diverse plant, bird, and animal species; and its significant physical, climatic, and environmental features. This captivating tribute to the Great Lakes region is also an essential guide to the challenge of preserving the natural world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d0b7d8e1c3a00458b77557c905cb04e0215dd21","amp;dn":"The+Great+Lakes%3A+The+Natural+History+of+a+Changing+Region","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d0b7d8e1c3a00458b77557c905cb04e0215dd21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,11,125,142,28,58,0,69,139,119,85,124,144,92,176,78,2,21,221,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
