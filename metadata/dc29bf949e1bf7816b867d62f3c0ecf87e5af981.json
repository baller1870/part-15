Included on this album is also the song Aretha sang at Bill Clinton's Inaugural Concert in 1993, &quot;I Dreamed A Dream&quot;, originally from the musical Les MisÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rables. Aretha's version of the song opens with the spoken line &quot;I had a dream...&quot; and the lyrics consequently take on an entirely different meaning - and sixteen years later she sang at another president's inauguration; Barack Obama's.\n\nTRACK LIST\n\nWhat You See Is What You Sweat\n==============================\n01.
