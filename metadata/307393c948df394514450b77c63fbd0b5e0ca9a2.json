On his way there, he bails his brother, Fuller Thomas (Steve Zahn), out of jail. Fuller, looking for a good time, decides to ride with Lewis. During their trip to pick up Venna, Fuller coaxes Lewis into playing a cruel joke, through their CB radio, on a truck driver, known only as 'Rusty Nail' (voiced by Ted Levine). When the joke takes a deadly turn, Lewis, Venna, and Fuller find themselves being relentlessly stalked by the psychotic truck driver who is looking for more than an apology.\n\n\nTAGLINE:\n\n\nIt started as a joke. Now the joke is on them. Don't screw with people you don't know. Don't play with strangers. Everything you say will come back to haunt you. Everything you see will terrify you.
