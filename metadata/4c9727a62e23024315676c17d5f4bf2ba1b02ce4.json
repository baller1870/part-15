Theres Gordie (Wil Wheaton), the intelligent, creative one with the obviously bright future. His best buddy, Chris (River Phoenix), hardens his image in order to hide the pain from the physical abuse he endures at home, all the while harboring the hope of escaping that image. Rounding out the foursome are Vern (Jerry OConnell), the pudgy tagalong, and Teddy (Corey Feldman), a loyal and funny but troubled kid with a death wish. When the four boys hear about a dead body 20 miles down the railroad tracks from their small Oregon town, they clandestinely set upon the unwieldly journey to lay eyes on this rare find. Amid numerous misadventures, Gordie, Chris, Vern, and Teddy savor what may be their last chance to revel in the simple life of children; around the corner is a future that could tear them apart, not to mention a tough teen gang who desires local fame by finding the body first.\n\nRegion: PAL\n   \nLanguage: Mono: Eng, Spa, Ita, Germ, Fren\n\n\nSubtitles: Ger, Eng, Ita, Spa, Pol, Ung, TÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼rk, Arab, DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ni, Finni, Hebr, Hin, Isl, Dutch, Norw, Port, Schwe, Tsche.\n\n\nDVD9=&gt;DVD5\n\nAnyDVD, DVDRemake Pro, DVDRebuilder Pro+CCE 4 pass.\n- Reduction Level for DVD-5: 90.7%\n- Overall Bitrate : 5&amp;#039;018Kbs\n- Space for Video : 3&amp;#039;238&amp;#039;490KB\n- Movie improvement from extra reduction = .8%\n- HIGH/LOW/TYPICAL Bitrates: 6&amp;#039;462/3&amp;#039;432/5&amp;#039;018 Kbs\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092005/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092005/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c9727a62e23024315676c17d5f4bf2ba1b02ce4","amp;dn":"Stand+by+Me","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c9727a62e23024315676c17d5f4bf2ba1b02ce4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,151,39,166,46,35,2,67,21,103,108,23,213,244,191,43,161,176,44,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
