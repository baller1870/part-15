Chilling, epic, and wholly original, this debut novel imagines a North America where dragons are kept on reservations, where strict blackout rules are obeyed no matter the cost, where the highly weaponized military operates in chilling secret, and where a gruesome television show called Kissing Dragons unites the population. Joshua McCune's debut novel offers action, adventure, fantasy, and a reimagining of popular dragon lore.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98416f9011117fe412a6ad7f62f06aaaf32aefce","amp;dn":"Talker+25+-+Joshua+McCune+%5BAdvance+Reader%27s+E-Proof%5D.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98416f9011117fe412a6ad7f62f06aaaf32aefce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,65,111,144,17,17,127,228,18,166,173,127,98,240,106,170,243,42,239,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
