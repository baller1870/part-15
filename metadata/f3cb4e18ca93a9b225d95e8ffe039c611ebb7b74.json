The band formed in 2005 and has released several split albums, EPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and more. There is not much known about the band members, except the fact that the following persons (pseudonyms) are in the band: Yusuke Flamethrower, Haruko Outlaw and Masaru Iron Bitch. Rumours go that Syphilitic Vaginas is a side-project of the guy behind Netjajev SS from Sweden.Unfortunately, this is the only album on the list I've put together that I don't actually own. I really don't think that's that ridiculous though when the first pressing of the bands debut full length is limited to 250 copies (90% of which I'm sure were sold in Japan.) I love obscure records and the hunt for rare pieces of vinyl, but in this instance I really wish they had gone a less kvlt route and at least done even a shittier edition limited to at least 1000 copies (which I'm sure would still sell out remarkably fast.) The rarity also accounts for that image sadly being the only one I can find of the album on the internet. Oh well, it's fucking outstanding. For those who haven't heard Syphilitic Vaginas before, they are a probably the best GISM worship band there has ever been, but on some of the newer records they've developed the sound much more into incorporating 1st Wave of Black Metal and Motorheady riffing, and that only makes it all the more incredible. I play the fuck out of the few Syphilitic Vaginas records I am lucky enough to have, and I wish I could say the same for Alpha Antichrist because I think it is their pinnacle of quality so far...maybe one day. For now it's pretty easy to find a d/l and I suggest you all get on doing that right now!\nTracklist\n\n01 sex, drugs &amp; violence\n02 high on necromancy\n03 anoda night rider\n04 baphomet in vitro\n05 white line black fever\n06 supersonic motor satanic\n07 black chrome supremacy\n08 witching power\n09 spark of the devil\n10 night perdition\n\nTracklist\n\nSelf Titled Tape '08\n01 inferno rider\n02 iron sabbath\n03 black leather terror\n04 hammer of hell\nBlack Motor Covenant 7&quot; '08\n05 black sorcery\n06 the lycan horror\n07 scream evil\n08 in devil night\nSelf Titled 12&quot; '11\n09 sacrifice tonight\n10 motor demon\n11 possessed to fuck\n12 angel of destruction\n13 in satanic service\n14 armageddon buttfuck\n15 nightly fighter\n16 cloven hoof\nNight Desecrate 9&quot; '07\n17 witchcraft night\n18 scorn of satan\n19 ritual titfuck\n20 night desecrate\n21 altar of penis demon\n22 goatfuck\n23 making love with devil (zouo cover)\nSplit 7&quot; with Netjajev SS '06\n24 bbc weapons\n25 kanpai war\n26 shred uranium pussy\n27 konnichiwa to yous\nUnreleased\n28 invocation\n29 hell in hades\n30 command us satan\n31 demon sexual\n32 black ritual murder\n33 oyama death cult\n34 tear off their wings\n35 march to golgotha\nSouds like something good to hear but not to Eat........","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3cb4e18ca93a9b225d95e8ffe039c611ebb7b74","amp;dn":"Syphilitic+Vaginas+-Alpha+Antichrist+%2B+Complete+Studio+Collectio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3cb4e18ca93a9b225d95e8ffe039c611ebb7b74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,203,78,24,202,147,169,178,37,217,94,143,254,3,156,97,30,187,123,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
