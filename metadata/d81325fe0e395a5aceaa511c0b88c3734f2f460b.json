This led to the loss of two-thirds of the hundred thousand items in the Kabul museum. \nThe Taliban was forced from Kabul after the U.S. military intervention in Afghanistan in late 2001. Before then, the Taliban's culture minister supervised the destruction of many of the remaining exhibits at the museum. \nWhat the Taliban didn't know was that many of the most magnificent objects had already been spirited away. More than 25 years ago museum staff had hidden the treasures as the bombs started to fall. (The Afghanistan government found the hidden treasure boxes in 2003 and made the announcement on August 25, 2003. It quickly asked for international assistance in conducting an inventory of the artifacts. The work was done in April, May, and June of that year. \nEarlier this year a safecracking at a presidential palace vault in downtown Kabul revealed that the entire trove was intact. Now an inventory project funded by the National Geographic Society has catalogued the more than 22,000 objects. The collection includes exquisite ivory statues and 2,500 years' worth of gold and silver coins. \nThe discovery is a ray of hope in the quest to restore Afghanistan's cultural heritage, most of which has been destroyed forever by decades of war and looting. \n&quot;By the end of the Taliban's reign, most of us thought there was nothing left-just destruction and despair,&quot; National Geographic Fellow Fredrik Hiebert said. Hiebert led the inventory project with support from National Geographic and the U.S. National Endowment for the Humanities.\n\n\n\n\n* Video Codec: XviD\n* Video Bitrate: 1664KB/s\n* Video Aspect Ratio: 1:76\n* Video Resolution: 704 x 400\n* Audio Codec: (Dolby AC3)\n* Audio BitRate: 192 KB/s 48000Hz\n* Run-Time: 55mins\n* Framerate: 23FPS\n* Number Of Parts: 1\n* Part Size: 746mb/s\n* Ripped by artistharry\n* Subtitles: No\n* Source: DVD\n\n\nMy torrents info at SuprBay &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=33643&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=33643&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d81325fe0e395a5aceaa511c0b88c3734f2f460b","amp;dn":"National.Geographic.Special.Lost.Treasures.of.Afghanistan.XviD.A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d81325fe0e395a5aceaa511c0b88c3734f2f460b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,19,37,254,14,57,90,90,206,170,81,28,11,136,195,115,79,47,70,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
