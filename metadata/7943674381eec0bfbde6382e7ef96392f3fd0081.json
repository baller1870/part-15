Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside RileyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.\n\nDirector: Pete Docter\n\nActors: Amy Poehler, Bill Hader, Mindy Kaling, Lewis Black, Phyllis Smith\n\nGenre: Comedy, Family","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7943674381eec0bfbde6382e7ef96392f3fd0081","amp;dn":"Inside+Out.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%232+%5BHD%5D+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7943674381eec0bfbde6382e7ef96392f3fd0081","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,67,103,67,129,238,192,191,189,230,56,46,126,249,99,146,243,253,0,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
