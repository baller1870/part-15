The episode examines the &quot;fire lance,&quot; beleived to be the first firearm. It was a bamboo tube with gunpowder and a projectile packed into it, highly effective but only at short ranges. Gunpowder remained a Chinese secret until the 13th century when Roger Bacon, a Franciscan monk, learned of it, saying, &quot;the sound of thunder may be artificially produced in the air with greater resulting horror than if it had been produced by natural causes.&quot; As the episode jumps ahead to more modern times, it examines the development of hand cannons made of bronze metal tubes and the development of the Matchlock, the Wheellock, and the Snaplock.. This episode ends with the lead-up to the place of arms in pre-revolution America and British General Gage's explicit orders to remove weapons from the colonists, resulting in the famed &quot;shot heard 'round the world.&quot;\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img805.imageshack.us/img805/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img805.imageshack.us/img805/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img708.imageshack.us/img708/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img708.imageshack.us/img708/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/4396/gunstheevolutionoffireaa.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/4396/gunstheevolutionoffireaa.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Technical Specs for SD\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1452 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 404\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.775 (~16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 23\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 40.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 7\n * Part Size: average 414 MB\n * Encoded by Harry65\n * Source: DVD\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Guns-The-Evolution-of-Firearms-Blu-ray/59215/#Review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Guns-The-Evolution-of-Firearms-Blu-ray/59215/#Review&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c68656c58358077d4a91db0633f845576cbe9852","amp;dn":"Guns+The+Evolution+of+Firearms+1of7+From+the+Invention+of+Gunpow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c68656c58358077d4a91db0633f845576cbe9852","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,134,86,197,131,88,7,125,74,145,219,6,51,248,69,87,108,190,152,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
