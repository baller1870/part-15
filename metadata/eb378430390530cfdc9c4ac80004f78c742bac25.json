An easy reccomendation\n for anyone who is fan of the genre or of the band.\n\n\nBackground:\nFor the uninformed, some background. Porcupine Tree are a progressive rock\n four-piece from Hemel Hempstead, north of London, England. Fronted by\n vocalist, guitarist and songwriter Steven Wilson, Porcupine Tree have been\n at the forefront of the modern prog-rock scene since the release of\n The Sky Moves Sideways in 1995. Wilson has gained prominence not only\n for his works in Porcupine Tree, but also for his contributions\n to works by Opeth, Marillion, as well as his other projects\n No-Man and Blackfield. Within Porcupine Tree are bassist Colin Edwin,\n keyboardist Richard Barbieri and drummer Gavin Harrison.\n\nInfo:\nFor this concert release, titled Arriving SomewhereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦, \n the band, together with touring guitarist John Wesley,\n performed at Park West in Chicago, Il. The band has previously stated\n that Park West was a favorite venue of theirs, and prime contender\n for a DVD recording. 15 songs are performed in total, covering songs\n from the album Stupid Dream, released in 1999, to Deadwing, in 2005\n and everything in between. Fans of the bands older, more psychedelic\n sound may be in for a disappointment, but the selection of songs is\n a solid representation of the bands more recent sound, blending melodic,\n almost radio-friendly tunes to some heavier riffs usually only found in the depths of metal.\n\nAudio Quality:\nAs expected, Steven Wilson has delivered on audio quality and mixing.\n Porcupine Tree music is often a choice pick by those reviewing high end audio products\n due to their high quality, clean production DVD-Audio releases and 5.1 DTS mixes.\n This DVD is no exception, with 48000 Hz PCM and DTS sound which is exceptionally\n clear and high quality with just the right amount of warm tone to make the soundtrack\n feel full, but not quite so much as to kill the live mood. There are a few periods where\n the music sounds almost prerecorded, but this is mostly due to the tight performance\n of the musicians and use of keyboards. These periods are hardly worth noting,\n but when the crowd cheers leave earshot, a sharp ear can sometimes pick them up,\n rare as they are. WilsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice, while not the best in the genreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, holds up\n well and provides ample emotion along with the higher tones and falsetto of John Wesley\n (who is a very impressive solo artist in his own right).\n Every part of the audio feels and sounds like it was thought through and stressed over,\n and the final product shows that easily.\n\nConclusion:\nSo in conclusion, thanks to a blend of a great set list, stunning audio and a competent\n video aspect, Arriving SomewhereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ is an excellent DVD concert that will certainly\n entertain any Porcupine Tree fan, or fan of the prog rock genre. The performance is next\n to flawless and stage presence is acceptable for a band with a lead singerguitarist.\n A few shortcomings such as slightly overactive camera effects and the lack of\n a documentary are all that really stop this DVD from being one of the best released\n in a long time. That said, these annoyances are nothing to prevent you buying or experiencing\n firsthand how strong this DVD is. So spend the money, put this in a high quality player\n with a dedicated AV receiver and see for yourself not only how impressive Porcupine Tree\n are as a musical ensemble, but also how impressive this DVD looks and sounds.\n Once on your sofa with the receiver just so and the TV levels calibrated,\n very few DVDs will come to rival Arriving SomewhereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s depth and quality.\n\n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Enjoy our releases and help us with sharing, please.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb378430390530cfdc9c4ac80004f78c742bac25","amp;dn":"Porcupine+Tree+-+Arriving+Somewhere+%282006+Dvd+Rip+2+Cd%29%5BEac+Flac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb378430390530cfdc9c4ac80004f78c742bac25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,55,132,48,57,5,48,207,220,156,74,200,0,4,247,140,116,43,172,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
