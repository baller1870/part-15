It deals with the machinations and activities of the Cardiff branch of the fictional Torchwood Institute, who deal mainly with incidents involving extraterrestrials. An initial 13-part series was commissioned by the BBC as a spin-off from the 2005 revival of the long-running science fiction programme Doctor Who with which it is closely interlinked. The main cast consists of John Barrowman, Eve Myles, Burn Gorman, Naoko Mori and Gareth David-Lloyd. Gorman and Mori left the programme after the second series, with Kai Owen promoted from a recurring role to the main cast in series 3.\n\nThe programme is produced in-house by BBC Wales. The Head of Drama at the time of the first season, Julie Gardner, serves as executive producer alongside Davies. (Julie Gardner is currently both Controller of Drama Commissioning at BBC Television and Head of Drama for BBC Wales.) The first two episodes of Series 1 of Torchwood premiered on 22 October 2006 on BBC Three and BBC HD. Series 2 premiered on BBC Two and BBC HD on 16 January 2008. The third series, a five part mini-series entitled Torchwood: Children of Earth, aired on BBC One and BBC HD between 6 July and 10 July 2009.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter has reported that Fox is developing a spin-off of Torchwood to be set in the United States.[9]\n\nBefore the revival of Doctor Who, Russell T Davies began to develop an idea for a science-fiction/crime drama in the style of American dramas like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. This idea, originally titled Excalibur, was abandoned until 2005, when BBC Three Controller Stuart Murphy invited Davies to develop a post-watershed science-fiction series for the channel. During the production of the 2005 series of Doctor Who, the word &quot;Torchwood&quot; (an anagram of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;) had been used as a title ruse for the series while filming its first few episodes and on the 'rushes' tapes to ensure they were not intercepted. Davies connected the word &quot;Torchwood&quot; to his earlier Excalibur idea and decided to make the series a Doctor Who spin-off. Subsequently, the word &quot;Torchwood&quot; was seeded in Doctor Who episodes and other media which aired in 2005 and 2006.\n\nThe series is set in Cardiff and follows the Welsh branch of a covert agency called the Torchwood Institute which investigates extraterrestrial incidents on Earth and scavenges alien technology for its own use (its origins are outlined in the Doctor Who episode &quot;Tooth and Claw&quot;). To paraphrase Torchwood Three's commander-in-chief, Captain Jack Harkness, the organisation is separate from the government, outside the police, and beyond the United Nations. Their public perception is as merely a 'special ops' group. The events of the first series take place some time after the Doctor Who series two finale, in which Torchwood's London headquarters was destroyed.\n\nThe main writer alongside Davies was Chris Chibnall, creator of the BBC light drama show Born and Bred. Other writers include P.J. Hammond, Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who script editor Helen Raynor, Cath Tregenna, and Doctor Who cast member Noel Clarke, who gained acclaim for his screenplay for the film Kidulthood. Russell T Davies wrote just the first episode.\n\nIn a 17 October 2005 announcement, Stuart Murphy described Torchwood as &quot;sinister and psychological...As well as being very British and modern and real.&quot; Davies further described it as &quot;a British sci-fi paranoid thriller, a cop show with a sense of humour. [...] Dark, wild and sexy, it's The X-Files meets This Life.&quot;[15][16] Davies later denied ever making this comparison, instead describing the show as &quot;alleyways, rain, the city&quot;.\n\nAs Torchwood is a post-watershed show ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ that is, after 9 p.m. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it has more mature content than Doctor Who. Davies told SFX: &quot;We can be a bit more visceral, more violent, and more sexual, if we want to. Though bear in mind that it's very teenage to indulge yourself in blood and gore, and Torchwood is going to be smarter than that. But itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the essential difference between BBC One at 7 pm, and BBC Three at, say, 9 pm. That says it all ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ instinctively, every viewer can see the huge difference there.&quot;[13] According to Barrowman: &quot;I don't do any nude scenes in series one; they're saving that for the next series! I don't have a problem with getting my kit off. As long as they pay me the right money, I'm ready to get out my cock and balls.&quot; Davies also joked to a BBC Radio Wales interviewer that he was &quot;not allowed&quot; to refer to the programme as &quot;Doctor Who for grown-ups&quot;.[19] The first series includes content rarely seen or heard in the Doctor Who franchise, including sex scenes (in episodes such as &quot;Day One&quot; and &quot;Out of Time&quot;), same sex kissing (with the exception of the Dr. Who Series 1 finale), and use of extreme profanity in several episodes.\n\n[img]http://img714.Imageshack.us/img714/8869/torchwoodscreenshots.png[/img]\n[img]http://img683.Imageshack.us/img683/8190/torchwood1x01tuttocambi.th.png[/img]\n\n  \n[img]http://img63.Imageshack.us/img63/8798/torchwoodtecnica.png[/img]\n\n\n[ Info sul file ]\n\n[b]Nome:[/b] Torchwood - 1x01 - Tutto Cambia (Everything Changes).avi\n[b]Data:[/b] 8/10/2008 19:03:30\n[b]Dimensione:[/b] 430,256,128 bytes (410.324 MB)\n\n[ Info generiche ]\n\n[b]Durata:[/b] 00:51:10 (3069.52 s)\n[b]Tipo di contenitore:[/b] AVI OpenDML\n[b]Streams totali:[/b] 3\n[b]Tipo stream n. 0:[/b] video\n[b]Tipo stream n. 1:[/b] audio\n[b]Tipo stream n. 2:[/b] audio\n[b]Audio streams:[/b] 2\n[b]ISFT:[/b] VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n[b]JUNK:[/b] VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n\n[ Giudizi sulla qualitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  ]\n\n[b]Risoluzione:[/b] ALTA (608 x 352)\n[b]Larghezza:[/b] multipla di 32 (BENE)\n[b]Altezza:[/b] multipla di 32 (BENE)\n[b]QualitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  DRF medio:[/b] MEDIA (3.995934)\n[b]QualitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  deviazione standard:[/b] MEDIA (1.120108)\n[b]Media pesata dev. std.:[/b] ALTA (0.499939)\n\n[ Traccia video ]\n\n[b]FourCC:[/b] xvid/XVID\n[b]Risoluzione:[/b] 608 x 352\n[b]Display aspect ratio:[/b] 19:11 = 1.727272\n[b]Framerate:[/b] 25 fps\n[b]Frames totali:[/b] 76738\n[b]Bitrate:[/b] 827.776580 kbps\n[b]Qf:[/b] 0.154713\n[b]Max key int:[/b] 250\n\n[ Traccia audio n. 1 ]\n\n[b]Audio tag:[/b] 0x55 (MP3)\n[b]Bitrate:[/b] 160 kbps CBR\n[b]Canali:[/b] 2\n[b]Frequenza:[/b] 48000 Hz\n[b]Stream size:[/b] 61,390,560 bytes\n[b]Ritardo:[/b] 0 ms\n\n[ Traccia audio n. 2 ]\n\n[b]Audio tag:[/b] 0x55 (MP3)\n[b]Bitrate:[/b] 115.848 kbps VBR\n[b]Canali:[/b] 2\n[b]Frequenza:[/b] 48000 Hz\n[b]Stream size:[/b] 44,448,624 bytes\n[b]Ritardo:[/b] 0 ms\n\n[ Info sulla codifica MPEG4 ]\n\n[b]User data:[/b] XviD0047\n[b]Packed bitstream:[/b] No\n[b]Interlaced:[/b] No\n[b]Aspect ratio:[/b] Square pixels\n[b]Quant type:[/b] MPEG custom (*)\n[b]Custom intra quant matrix:[/b] \n      8  16  20  23  27  30  32  34\n     16  16  23  24  29  31  34  38\n     20  23  27  28  30  35  38  40\n     23  24  28  29  35  39  40  44\n     27  29  30  35  39  42  45  50\n     30  31  35  39  42  46  54  59\n     32  34  38  40  45  54  62  72\n     34  38  40  44  50  59  72  84\n[b]Custom inter quant matrix:[/b] \n     17  19  21  23  25  27  29  31\n     19  21  23  25  27  28  29  33\n     21  23  25  27  29  30  32  37\n     23  25  27  30  31  34  40  45\n     25  27  29  31  38  46  54  60\n     27  28  30  34  46  58  72  74\n     29  29  32  40  54  72  90 100\n     31  33  37  45  60  74 100 124\n[b]Frames totali:[/b] 76738\n[b]Frames corrotti:[/b] 0\n\n[b]I-VOPs:[/b]  1116 (  1.454 %)                          \n[b]P-VOPs:[/b] 38770 ( 50.523 %) #############            \n[b]B-VOPs:[/b] 36852 ( 48.023 %) ############             \n\n[b]Max consecutive B-VOPs:[/b] 1\n\n[ Analisi DRF ]\n\n[b]DRF medio:[/b] 3.995934\n[b]Deviazione standard:[/b] 1.120108\n[b]DRF max:[/b] 7\n\n[b]DRF7:[/b]     0 (  0.000 %)                          \n\nRapporto generato da(26-05-2007) in data 31 gen 2010, h 01:36:43\n  \nLista Episodi:\n - Torchwood - 1x00 - Promo\n - Torchwood - 1x01 - Tutto Cambia (Everything Changes)\n - Torchwood - 1x02 - Primo Giorno (Day One)\n - Torchwood - 1x03 - La Macchina Dei Fantasmi (Ghost Machine)\n - Torchwood - 1x04 - La Donna Cibernetica (Cyberwoman)\n - Torchwood - 1x05 - La Fate Cattive (Small Worlds)\n - Torchwood - 1x06 - Il Villagggio Deglio Orrori (Countrycide)\n - Torchwood - 1x07 - Un Amore Venuto Da Lontano (Greeks Bearing Gifts)\n - Torchwood - 1x08 - Continuano A Uccidere Suzie (They Keep Killing Suzie)\n - Torchwood - 1x09 - L'Occhio Alieno (Random Shoes)\n - Torchwood - 1x10 - Fuori Dal Tempo (Out Of Time)\n - Torchwood - 1x11 - Combattimento (Combat)\n - Torchwood - 1x12 - Il Capitano Jack Harkness (Captain Jack Harkness)\n - Torchwood - 1x13 - La Fine Dei Giorni (End Of Days)\n[img]http://img718.Imageshack.us/img718/144/torchwoodnote.png[/img]\n[b]7g/7 a 20k salvo inconvenienti fino ai primi 50 completi[/b]\nperditempo.[/quote]\n\nVisit http://www.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:504bc0e52e3e16c1c623a3c47e95654e3d0843c2","amp;dn":"%5BMux+-+XviD+-+Ita+Eng+Mp3+-+Sub+Ita+Eng+Fra%5D+Torchwood+S01e01-13","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"504bc0e52e3e16c1c623a3c47e95654e3d0843c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,75,192,229,46,62,22,193,198,35,163,196,126,149,101,78,61,8,67,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
