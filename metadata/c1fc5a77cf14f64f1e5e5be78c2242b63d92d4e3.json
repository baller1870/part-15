FAST \n\ntry it \n\nFULL INSTALLER - even the chrome site jus gives u a online installer not full version thats transferable everywhere and get it FASTER DOWNLOAD!!\n\nVersion 17 of Google's popular Chrome browser entered the beta channel on Thursday, packed with an array of new features designed to improve the software's speed and security.\n\nSIMILAR ARTICLES:\nGoogle Releases Chrome 12, Adds Security and 3D\nChrome 13 Renders Pages Before You Click\nChrome, Firefox Experiment With Hidden URL Bars\nGoogle Revamps New-Tab Page in Chrome Web Browser\nGoogle Chrome Tip: Enable AutoFill for Fast and Easy Form Completion\nGoogle Chrome Adds Cloud Print Option, Multiple Profile Support\nPerhaps most notable is the fact that Chrome can now start loading some Web pages in the background, even before the user has finished typing the URL into the browser's ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOmniboxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ search and address bar.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIf the URL auto-completes to a site youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re very likely to visit, Chrome will begin to prerender the page,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ explained Google Software Engineer Dominic Hamon in a post yesterday on the Google Chrome Blog. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPrerendering reduces the time between when you hit Enter and when you see your fully-loaded web page--in some cases, the web page appears instantly.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nScrutinizing Executables\n\nNew security features, meanwhile, include improvements to ChromeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Safe Browsing technology that are designed to help protect users from a wider variety of malware attacks.\n\nUntil now, Chrome has focused primarily on protecting against sites that exploit the user's computer without requiring any user interaction, Hamon noted. Today, however, there are a growing number of malicious websites that try to convince the user to download and run harmful files--sometimes even claiming that those files are free anti-virus products, he added.\n\nAccordingly, Chrome 17 is now better able to analyze executable files that the user downloads, including ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ.exeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ.msiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ files.\n\n'Chrome Will Warn You'\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIf a file you download is known to be bad, or is hosted on a website that hosts a relatively high percentage of malicious downloads, Chrome will warn you that the file appears to be malicious and that you should discard it,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Hamon explained.\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\ncheck out my other unique cool torrents\namerican greed season 4\ncrank yankers season 3\njersey shore season 4\nphil hendrie show all years\nPerfect Photo Suite 6\nMonstercat Dubstep Series\nDFX audio enhancer 10 \nKourtney And Kim Take New York\nand over 40 gigs of music !\n           &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/atndigcrk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/atndigcrk/&lt;/a&gt;\t\t\n\n------------------------------------------\nMy rss Feed : plug into ur utorrent    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/cb7aa30de11cc37b2b717e32c4a92714&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/cb7aa30de11cc37b2b717e32c4a92714&lt;/a&gt;\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1fc5a77cf14f64f1e5e5be78c2242b63d92d4e3","amp;dn":"GOOGLE+Chrome+17+Beta+-+Full+Installer+%28SUPER+NEW%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1fc5a77cf14f64f1e5e5be78c2242b63d92d4e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,252,90,119,207,20,246,79,30,94,91,231,140,34,66,182,61,146,212,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
