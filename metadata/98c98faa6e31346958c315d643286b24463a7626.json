The first male child born in the newly established Republic of Texas, Eli McCullough is thirteen years old when a marauding band of Comanches storms his homestead and brutally murders his mother and sister, taking him captive. Brave and clever, Eli quickly adapts to life among the Comanches, learning their ways and language, answering to a new name, becoming the chief's adopted son, and waging war against their enemies, including white menÃ¢â‚¬â€which complicates his sense of loyalty and understanding of who he is. But when disease, starvation, and overwhelming numbers of armed Americans decimate the tribe, Eli finds himself alone. Neither white nor Indian, civilized nor fully wild, he must carve a place for himself in a world in which he does not fully belongÃ¢â‚¬â€a journey of adventure, tragedy, hardship, grit, and luck that reverberates in the lives of his progeny.\n\nIntertwined with Eli's story are those of his son, Peter, a man who bears the emotional cost of his father's drive for power, and Jeannie, Eli's great-granddaughter, a woman who must fight hardened rivals to succeed in a man's world.\n\nPhilipp Meyer deftly explores how Eli's ruthlessness and steely pragmatism transform subsequent generations of McCulloughs. Love, honor, even children are sacrificed in the name of ambition as the family becomes one of the richest powers in Texas, a ranching-and-oil dynasty of unsurpassed wealth and privilege. Yet, like all empires, the McCulloughs must eventually face the consequences of their choices. Harrowing, panoramic, and vividly drawn, The Son is a masterful achievement from a sublime young talent.\n\nRead by Will Patton, Kate Mulgrew, Scott Shepherd, and Clifton Collins Jr.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98c98faa6e31346958c315d643286b24463a7626","amp;dn":"The+Son+By+Philipp+Meyer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98c98faa6e31346958c315d643286b24463a7626","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,201,143,170,110,49,52,105,88,195,21,214,67,40,107,36,70,58,118,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
