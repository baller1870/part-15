Has it blessed your marriage? Deepened your respect for your body? Has it made your sex life fantastic? Do you and your spouse hold hands at sunset, and do pink flowers grow around your marital bed? If so, this book is not for you. But if you've tried Natural Family Planning and have discovered that your life is now awful-or if you feel judged or judgey, or if you trust NFP but your doctor doesn't, or if you're just trying to figure out how the heck to have a sex life that is holy but still human-you'll find comfort, encouragement, honesty, wit, and, most important, practical advice in The Sinner's Guide to NFP. Popular Catholic writer Simcha Fisher shows what it's really like to practice NFP, and how to achieve those fabled &quot;marriage building&quot; benefits. The Sinner's Guide to NFP helps you with NFP and Your Spiritual Life, NFP and the Rest of the World, NFP in the Trenches. The next time you ask yourself, &quot;If NFP is wonderful, why am I so miserable?&quot; - don't panic. The Sinner's Guide to Natural Family Planning is here to help.\r\n\r\n2.
