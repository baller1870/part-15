It was as a double A-side with album opener &quot;Planet Telex&quot;. &quot;High and Dry&quot; was released in the UK on 5 March 1995 and remains one of the band's most popular radio hits, despite reaching only #17 upon release.\n\n&quot;High and Dry&quot; was recorded during the Pablo Honey sessions but was dismissed by the band, who thought that it sounded like a Rod Stewart song. However, during the sessions for The Bends it was rediscovered and remastered, as it was felt that it worked well with the rest of the album's content. The version that appears on the album is the original demo; it was never re-recorded.\n\nThe song is widely regarded as Radiohead's most accessible pop hit, and was a live favourite, though it has not been performed in a decade. In a 2007 interview with Pitchfork Media, Thom Yorke stated that he did not like the song, saying &quot;It's not bad... it's very bad&quot;. He also stated that he was pressured into including the song on The Bends.\n\nThe music video, directed by Paul Cunningham, stars the band in a diner (Dick's Restaurant &amp; Cocktails, in San Leandro, California), where other patrons are involved in dramas of their own, which are revealed through the use of flashbacks. A couple and the diner's cook are involved in an unspecified crime. A businessman is hiding something in his briefcase. In the end, the two dramas are resolved when the guilty parties are betrayed, the cook gives the couple a time bomb and the businessman is ambushed and killed (though the murder is only suggested).\n\nThe Bends is the second album by English alternative rock band Radiohead, released on 13 March 1995. The Bends was produced by John Leckie at EMI's studios in London, and engineered by Nigel Godrich, who would go on to produce all future albums by the band. Featuring five charting singles, the album also marked the beginning of a shift in aesthetics and themes for the band, with greater use of keyboards, and more abrasive guitar tracks balancing subtler ones. The introspective post-grunge Radiohead style of Pablo Honey evolved toward more multilayered rock with cryptic lyrics and larger ideas, as the band and singer Thom Yorke reacted against the rigours of near-constant world tours. &quot;Street Spirit (Fade Out)&quot;, the final single and last song on the album, became their first top five UK hit.\n\nThe album was subject to greater critical acclaim than their debut Pablo Honey (1993), receiving an enthusiastic critical reaction, and it reached number four in the UK Albums Chart. However, it failed to build on the commercial success of their single &quot;Creep&quot; outside the United Kingdom, and it peaked on the American charts at number 88. Although it lacked the instant success of later Radiohead albums, The Bends achieved triple platinum sales certifications in the UK and Canada and platinum sales in the US and the EU. In the years since its release, the album has frequently appeared in listener polls and critics' lists of best contemporary rock albums.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c0cadc588ff5bbd5eaa752b44f0c412056dcfb5","amp;dn":"Radiohead+-+High+And+Dry+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c0cadc588ff5bbd5eaa752b44f0c412056dcfb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,12,173,197,136,255,91,189,94,170,117,43,68,240,196,18,5,109,207,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
