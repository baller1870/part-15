Based on the book When Men Become Gods by New York Times bestselling author Stephen Singular, the movie chronicles JeffsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Tony Goldwyn) rise to power after the death of his father, Rulon Jeffs (Martin Landau). Within days of his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s passing, Warren married all of his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wives and dictatorial control over his polygamist followers ensued. He demanded women in the sect be completely subservient to men, banned laughing, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“reassignedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ wives to other men at whim. Jeffs was eventually charged as an accomplice to rape for arranging underage marriages but fled prosecution. After a year-long manhunt, he was finally apprehended in Texas and brought back to trial. The courtroom testimony of two brave young women who escaped his reign of terror ensured he would finally be convicted and sentenced to life in prison. Outlaw Prophet: Warren Jeffs gives an inside look at the psychology of a cult leader and those who blindly followed him. Even to this day with their leader behind bars, members of his polygamist cult still believe that he is the prophet chosen by God himself.\n\nCast: \n\nSage Bell ... Young Girl \n \nBranton Box ...
