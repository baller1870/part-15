That track blazes!! One of my friends said that it was incredible that two guitarists as good as Brad Gillis and Jeff Watson made it into the same band. How true. The best thing about this album is how it flows, maintaining a rocking yet melodic form throughout. I saw Night Ranger live in 1984 and again in 1999; they showcased their awesome talent as musicians on both occasions. They sounded great live. My favorite thing about this album is the unique guitar style of Brad Gillis. As soon as you hear his expressive solos, you know it is him, wailing away on his red guitar. I think this album shows the group at its rockin&amp;#039; best, before the pressure to conform to radio based hits took its toll. Check out &quot;Can&amp;#039;t Find Me a Thrill,&quot; &quot;Eddie&amp;#039;s Comin&amp;#039; Out Tonight,&quot; and &quot;Night Ranger(the song)&quot; for a chance to kick out the jams. Catch you on the Dawn Patrol, my rockin&amp;#039; brothers &amp; sisters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb017364bc3e8dda3ae4d4bb57e2840714fec5bf","amp;dn":"Night+Ranger+-+Dawn+Patrol","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb017364bc3e8dda3ae4d4bb57e2840714fec5bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,1,115,100,188,62,141,218,58,228,212,187,87,226,132,7,20,254,197,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
