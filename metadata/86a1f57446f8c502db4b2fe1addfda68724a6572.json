It was released on October 2, 2012. The book takes place where The Son of Neptune left off. The book is told from the points-of-view of Annabeth Chase, Leo Valdez, Percy Jackson, and Piper McLean.\n&quot;In The Son of Neptune, Percy, Hazel, and Frank met in Camp Jupiter, the Roman equivalent of Camp Half-Blood, and traveled to the land beyond the gods to complete a dangerous quest. The third book in the Heroes of Olympus series will unite them with Jason, Piper, and Leo. But they number only six--who will complete the Prophecy of Seven?\nThe Greek and Roman demigods will have to cooperate in order to defeat the giants released by the Earth Mother, Gaea. Then they will have to sail together to the ancient land--Rome itself--to find the Doors of Death. What exactly are the Doors of Death? Much of the prophecy remains a mystery...\nWith old friends and new friends joining forces, a marvelous ship, fearsome foes, and an exotic setting, The Mark of Athena promises to be another unforgettable adventure by master storyteller Rick Riordan.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Told from the perspectives of four different demigods, including Annabeth from Percy Jackson and the Olympians and Jason, The Mark of Athena unites the Greek and Roman main characters from The Lost Hero and The Son of Neptune. In a fantastical ship called the Argo II, seven demigods journey by air across the United States and by sea to Rome on their quest to defeat the earth mother, Gaea. Meanwhile, war is breaking out between the Roman and Greek demigods they left behind, and only Annabeth holds the key to restoring peace.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The Mark of Athena trailer\n&quot;Annabeth is terrified. Just when she's about to be reunited with Percy, after six months of being apart, thanks to Hera, it looks like Camp Jupiter is preparing for war. As Annabeth and her friends Jason, Piper, and Leo fly in on the Argo II, she can't blame the Roman demigods for thinking the ship is a Greek weapon. With its steaming bronze dragon masthead, Leo's fanatical creation doesn't appear friendly. Annabeth hopes that the sight of their praetor Jason on deck will reassure the Romans that the visitors from Camp Half-Blood come in peace.\nAnd that's only one of her worries. In her pocket Annabeth carries a gift from her mother that came with an unnerving demand: Follow the Mark of Athena. Avenge me. Annabeth already feels weighed down by the prophecy that will send seven demigods to find-and close- the Doors of Death. What more does Athena want from her?\nAnnabeth's biggest fear, though, is that Percy might have changed. What if he's now attached to Roman ways? Does he still need his old friends? As the daughter of the goddess of war and wisdom, Annabeth knows she was born to be a leader, but never again does she want to be without Seaweed Brain by her side.\nNarrated by four demigods, The Mark of Athena is an unforgettable journey across land and sea to Rome, where important discoveries, surprising sacrifices and unspeakable horrors await. Climb aboard the Argo II, if you dare...&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86a1f57446f8c502db4b2fe1addfda68724a6572","amp;dn":"Rick+Riordan+-+The+Mark+of+Athena","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86a1f57446f8c502db4b2fe1addfda68724a6572","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,161,245,116,70,248,197,2,219,75,47,225,173,223,218,104,114,74,101,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
