YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to use JavaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s network class library to quickly and easily accomplish common networking tasks such as writing multithreaded servers, encrypting communications, broadcasting to the local network, and posting data to server-side programs.\n\nAuthor Elliotte Rusty Harold provides complete working programs to illustrate the methods and classes he describes. This thoroughly revised fourth edition covers REST, SPDY, asynchronous I/O, and many other recent technologies.\n\nExplore protocols that underlie the Internet, such as TCP/IP and UDP/IP\nLearn how JavaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s core I/O API handles network input and output\nDiscover how the InetAddress class helps Java programs interact with DNS\nLocate, identify, and download network resources with JavaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s URI and URL classes\nDive deep into the HTTP protocol, including REST, HTTP headers, and cookies\nWrite servers and network clients, using JavaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s low-level socket classes\nManage many connections at the same time with the nonblocking I/O","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ad37736d923754d99135cb1ac2442a09da851d5","amp;dn":"Java+Network+Programming+Fourth+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ad37736d923754d99135cb1ac2442a09da851d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,211,119,54,217,35,117,77,153,19,92,177,172,36,66,160,157,168,81,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
