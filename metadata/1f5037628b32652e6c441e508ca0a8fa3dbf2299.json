Ian Broudie and Paul Simpson created some incredibly catchy and cheerful pop numbers, especially the timeless singles &quot;Flaming Sword&quot; and &quot;My Boyish Days.&quot; Other wonderful numbers include &quot;Whatever Possessed You,&quot; &quot;Cymophane&quot; and title track. Many of their tracks blended keyboard hooks with energetically-strummed acoustic guitars. Others are synthesizer-based throw-aways that closely resemble better-known songs.\n\nThis cd includes nearly everything the duo did. One flaw is that the cd omits parts 3 and 4 of a b-side mini-suite from one of their singles in favor of a second version of &quot;Flaming Sword&quot; that is too similar to the other to warrant inclusion. Still, a welcome appearance for those who mourned the early demise of this partnership, although the later emergence of The Lightning Seeds and continuation of The Wild Swans would partially carry on this project.\n\nTracklisting:\n\n01 Diamons and Emeralds 3:21 \n02 An Evening in the Ray 2:51 \n03 Chandeliers 3:39 \n04 Flaming Sword 3:14 \n05 Cymophane 4:34 \n06 Love Crowns and Crucifies 2:44 \n07 Temper Temper 3:28 \n08 White Cloud 3:35 \n09 Caretaking 3:48 \n10 My Boyish Days (12&quot; version) 6:44 \n11 Sad Day for England 4:30 \n12 Soldiers and Sailors 2:49 \n13 Whatever Possessed You 3:10 \n14 Such Is Life 3:33 \n15 What Kind of World 3:40 \n16 Nature Prayed Upon 4:17 \n17 Flaming Sword (12&quot; version) 4:07 \n18 Misericorde 4:07 \n19 Besides 1 &amp; 2 3:51 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f5037628b32652e6c441e508ca0a8fa3dbf2299","amp;dn":"Care+-+Diamonds+And+Emeralds","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f5037628b32652e6c441e508ca0a8fa3dbf2299","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,80,55,98,139,50,101,46,108,68,30,80,140,160,168,250,61,191,34,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
