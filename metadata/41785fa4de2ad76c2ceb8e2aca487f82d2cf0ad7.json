The library, however, is not self-explanatory. To make full use of its componentsÃ¢â‚¬â€œand to benefit from their powerÃ¢â‚¬â€œyou need a resource that does far more than list the classes and their functions.\n\nThe C++ Standard Library: A Tutorial and Reference, Second Edition, describes this library as now incorporated into the new ANSI/ISO C++ language standard (C++11). The book provides comprehensive documentation of each library component, including an introduction to its purpose and design; clearly written explanations of complex concepts; the practical programming details needed for effective use; traps and pitfalls; the exact signature and definition of the most important classes and functions; and numerous examples of working code. The book focuses in particular on the Standard Template Library (STL), examining containers, iterators, function objects, and STL algorithms.\n\nThe book covers all the new C++11 library components, including\n\nConcurrency\nFractional arithmetic\nClocks and timers\nTuples\nNew STL containers\nNew STL algorithms\nNew smart pointers\nNew locale facets\nRandom numbers and distributions\nType traits and utilities\nRegular expressions\n\nThe book also examines the new C++ programming style and its effect on the standard library, including lambdas, range-based for loops, move semantics, and variadic templates.\nGenre: Non Fiction , Computer Related\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41785fa4de2ad76c2ceb8e2aca487f82d2cf0ad7","amp;dn":"The+C%2B%2B+Standard+Library+A+Tutorial+and+Reference+%282nd+Edition%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41785fa4de2ad76c2ceb8e2aca487f82d2cf0ad7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,120,95,164,222,42,215,108,44,235,142,42,202,72,127,130,210,207,10,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
