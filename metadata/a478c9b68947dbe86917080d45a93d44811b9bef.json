Most of the \n\nselections, although allegedly Ã¢â‚¬Å“standards,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ were of more recent vintage (like Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Lot of \n\nLivinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to DoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“If I Were a CarpenterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), and even if Morgan and the other musicians play \n\nwell, nothing too exciting occurs. Although not a dud, it was not a major loss that this \n\nrecording stayed in the vaults.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a478c9b68947dbe86917080d45a93d44811b9bef","amp;dn":"Lee+Morgan+-+Standards+%5BEac+Flac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a478c9b68947dbe86917080d45a93d44811b9bef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,120,201,182,137,71,219,232,105,23,8,13,69,169,61,68,129,27,155,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
