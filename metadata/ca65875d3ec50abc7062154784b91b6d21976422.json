He has had a profound impact upon literary theory and philosophy.   This archive includes thirteen of his works in English translation.\n\nDerrida began speaking and writing publicly at a time when the French intellectual scene was experiencing an increasing rift between what could broadly speaking be called &quot;phenomenological&quot; and &quot;structural&quot; approaches to understanding individual and collective life. For those with a more phenomenological bent, the goal was to understand experience by comprehending and describing its genesis, the process of its emergence from an origin or event. For the structuralists, this was precisely the false problem, and the &quot;depth&quot; of experience could in fact only be an effect of structures which are not themselves experiential. It is in this context that in 1959 Derrida asks the question: must not structure have a genesis, and must not the origin, the point of genesis, be already structured, in order to be the genesis of something?\n\nThat introduction is adapted from part of the article in Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrida).  \n\nTake what you want, enjoy (if you can understand) what you take, and please seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca65875d3ec50abc7062154784b91b6d21976422","amp;dn":"Jacques+Derrida+Archive","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca65875d3ec50abc7062154784b91b6d21976422","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,101,135,93,62,197,10,188,112,98,21,71,132,185,27,109,33,151,100,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
