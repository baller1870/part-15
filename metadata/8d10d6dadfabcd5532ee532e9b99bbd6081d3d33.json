Backed by a who's who of musicians including Guido Brasso, Phil Dwyer, Robi Botos and more, 'The Other Woman' is infused with lush arrangements and luxurious vocals that dazzle on this new release. &quot;\n\nI was introduced to Mlle Chamberland by jango.com and immediately had to find out more about her and her music. I am a big fan of the old &quot;Torch Singers&quot; and Crooners. This woman is one of the rare contemporary artists who easily measures up to the greats. I had to get this CD immediately to share with my friends. I rarely take the time to write a review, but this is just too good to not rave about. ~ Lee Oberg\n\nI happened into an art gallery and heard &quot;Le Mer&quot;... Had to have the album, and every track is fabulous. Smoky, sweet and incredibly sexy vocals and instrumentals... A must have if you love jazz divas like Diana, Nina et al... ~ C.
