When Mong-lyong decides to take him under his wing, Bang-ja gets to share a room with the wise, MA. While sharing the room, MA teaches Bang-ja of all the arts of seduction. When strolling the park one day, Mong-lyong meets Chun-hyang, the daughter of the owner of the park, and he instantly falls in love and encourages Bang-ja to arrange a meeting with her. But Bang-jaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s feeling for her was also the same and he seeks advice from Ma. Ma tells him of Chun-hyangÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s real intention to win over Mong-lyong for his social status. Without knowing, Mong-lyong urges for a second meeting with Chun-hyang. Bang-jaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s anger towards Mong-lyong for using his nobility to attract her heart triggers his plan to use MaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s art of seduction. Successfully he wins her heart and body, but under the condition that he will help her to get married to Mong-lyong. Everything seems to go as planned but when Mong-lyong finds out their relationship, whole thing is about to go wrong.\n__________\n&quot;Bang-ja Chronicles&quot; (BANGJAJEON) is a motion picture twist to Chunhyangjeon, a classic Korean romance novel. In this new film, Kim changes its plot - in the original novel, it's a love story of Mongryong and Chunhyang, but in the film, Bangja, Mongryong's servant, joins in to make it a love triangle.\n\nKim Joo-hyeok plays Bangja, Ryoo Seung-beom as Mongryong and Jo Yeo-jeong as Chunhyang. The film opens on June 3.\n\nThe original novel has been adapted into movies several times, most notably as SEONG CHUNHYANG in 1961 by Shin Sang-ok. Starring Choi Eun-hee and Kim Jin-gyu as Chunhyang and Mongryong, respectively, it was one of the first full color-cinemascope Korean films. Veteran director Im Kwon-taek also made his own adaptation CHUNHYANG in 2000, starring Jo Seung-woo and Lee Hyo-jeong.\n\nIMDb n/a","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e923cba19d325119c360c33173c8653a0b8b9c9","amp;dn":"The.Servant.2010.BluRay.720p.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e923cba19d325119c360c33173c8653a0b8b9c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,146,60,186,25,211,37,17,156,54,12,51,23,60,134,83,160,184,185,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
