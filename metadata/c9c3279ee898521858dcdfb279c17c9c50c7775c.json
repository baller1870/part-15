This new volume discusses more of the health claims authorised to date for use in the EU. The chapters cover details of various permitted claims, such as the approved wording, conditions of use, the target group for the claims, the evidence for the claimed health benefits, and where appropriate details of other relevant legislation, consumer-related issues and future trends.\r\n\r\nThe book opens with an overview of regulatory developments relating to health claims. Part One reviews authorised disease risk reduction claims and proprietary claims. The second part investigates ingredients with permitted â€˜general functionâ€™ claims, with chapters examining ingredients such as red yeast rice, glucomannan and guar gum. The final section of the book explores foods and nutrients with permitted health claims, including chapters on authorised EU health claims for prunes, foods with low or reduced sodium or saturated fatty acids, and claims for essential and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding on volume 1, this title ensures that the area of EU health claims in food is comprehensively covered\r\nChapters are devoted to individual food ingredients and substances, covering the range of issues related to health claims\r\n\r\nHealth-promoting products are an increasing consumer trend in product development and this book provides key information on these advances","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9c3279ee898521858dcdfb279c17c9c50c7775c","amp;dn":"Foods%2C+Nutrients+and+Food+Ingredients+with+Authorised+EU+Health+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9c3279ee898521858dcdfb279c17c9c50c7775c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,195,39,158,232,152,82,24,88,220,223,178,121,193,124,156,80,199,119,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
