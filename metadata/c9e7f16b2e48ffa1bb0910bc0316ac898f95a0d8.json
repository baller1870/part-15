Everyday garment? Art object? Symbol of Japan? As this book shows, the kimono has served all of these roles, its meaning changing across time and with the perspective of the wearer or viewer.\n\n Kimono: A Modern History begins by exposing the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century foundations of the modern kimono fashion industry. It explores the crossover between Ã¢â‚¬ËœartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœfashionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in this period at the hands of famous Japanese painters who worked with clothing pattern books and painted directly onto garments. With JapanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exposure to Western fashion in the nineteenth century, and WesternersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ exposure to Japanese modes of dress and design, the kimono took on new associations and came to symbolize an exotic culture and an alluring female form. In the aftermath of the Second World War, the kimono industry was sustained through government support. The line between fashion and art became blurred as kimonos produced by famous designers were collected for their beauty and displayed in museums, rather than being worn as clothing. Today, the kimono has once again taken on new dimensions, as the Internet and social media proliferate images of the kimono as a versatile garment to be integrated into a range of individual styles.\n\n Kimono: A Modern History, the inspiration for a major exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, not only tells the story of a distinctive garmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever-changing functions and image, but provides a novel perspective on JapanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s modernization and encounter with the West","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9e7f16b2e48ffa1bb0910bc0316ac898f95a0d8","amp;dn":"Kimono%3A+A+Modern+History+%282014%29+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9e7f16b2e48ffa1bb0910bc0316ac898f95a0d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,231,241,107,46,72,255,161,187,9,16,188,3,22,172,137,143,149,160,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
