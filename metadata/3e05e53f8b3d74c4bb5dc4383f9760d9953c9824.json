Not a &quot;B&quot; side on it! Every song is a hit, and the great harmonies the guys make are great to listen to no matter what the weather, no matter what your mood. A great combination of upbeat music with great messages! To top it off, each of the members is probably the best musician in their field, especially drummer Mark Trojanowski and lead guitar Ryan Newell. This is a must-have album for anyone who needs a break from rock and roll.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e05e53f8b3d74c4bb5dc4383f9760d9953c9824","amp;dn":"Sister+Hazel+-+...Somewhere+More+Familiar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e05e53f8b3d74c4bb5dc4383f9760d9953c9824","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,5,229,63,139,61,116,196,187,93,196,56,63,151,96,217,149,60,152,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
