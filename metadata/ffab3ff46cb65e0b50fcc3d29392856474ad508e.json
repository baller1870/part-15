It received supreme critical acclaim for the screenplay by Arthur Hopcraft, the star Alex Guinness and the camerawork of Tony Pierce-Roberts.\n\nIn Alex Guinness&amp;#039;s first major TV role he plays George Smiley, a retired agent who is secretly brought into &quot;the Circus&quot; (the code name for British Secret Intelligent Service) to root out a top-level mole. Gradually piecing together the story, the weary but determined Smiley trawls through the murky waters of Cold War espionage and his own past.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffab3ff46cb65e0b50fcc3d29392856474ad508e","amp;dn":"LE_CARRE_TINKER_TAYLOR_SOLDIER_SPY_DISC1_DVD5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffab3ff46cb65e0b50fcc3d29392856474ad508e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,171,63,244,108,182,94,11,80,252,195,210,147,146,133,100,116,173,80,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
