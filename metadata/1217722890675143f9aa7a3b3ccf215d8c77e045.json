Vintage Rock chronicles all the stellar artists and music, the enduring legacy of those early pioneers - and why itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still the best way to live. Spanning the dawn of the 50s to early Beatles pre Eastern mysticism, Vintage Rock covers a time of Mods and Rockers, crinoline skirts and blue jeans, rock star movies and screaming-girl concerts. This special magazine rejoices in the music and verve of Elvis, The Shadows, Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Gene Vincent and a host more, and speaks to a contemporary audience that relishes the vitality and flair of the era.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1217722890675143f9aa7a3b3ccf215d8c77e045","amp;dn":"Vintage+Rock+-+June+2014++UK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1217722890675143f9aa7a3b3ccf215d8c77e045","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,23,114,40,144,103,81,67,249,170,122,59,60,207,33,93,140,119,224,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
