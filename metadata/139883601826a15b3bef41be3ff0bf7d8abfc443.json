With rich polymer notation, atom numbering,\nBioArt templates, and modern user interface, ChemDraw is\nmore powerful than ever before. Create tables of structures,\nidentify and label stereochemistry, estimate NMR spectra\nfrom a ChemDraw structure with structure-to-spectrum\ncorrelation, obtain structures from chemical names, assign\nnames from structures, and create multi-page documents\nand posters.\n\nChemDraw/Excel\nallows the user to create chemically\nknowledgeable spreadsheets within the familiar Microsoft\nExcel environment. You can build and manipulate chemical\nstructures within Excel, compute chemical properties and\nperform database searches.\n\nChem3D Ultra\nincludes a number of molecular modeling\ncapabilities such as molecular overlay, conformational searching\nand dihedral driver support. It also includes interfaces for\noptional use of MOPAC, Gaussian and GAMESS. The user\ncan also compute advanced physical properties such as\nCLogP and ChemProp. These properties can be used to\ncreate SAR tables. ChemSAR/Excel can then be used to\nexplore structure activity relationships. High quality Chem3D\ngraphics can be viewed on the web using the Chem3D ActiveX.\n\nChemFinder\nis a fast, chemically intelligent, relational\ndatabase search engine for desktop, workgroup or enterprise\napplications. Extended integration with Microsoft Excel and\nWord adds chemical searching and database capability to\nspreadsheets and documents.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:139883601826a15b3bef41be3ff0bf7d8abfc443","amp;dn":"Cambridgesoft+ChemOffice+Ultra+2004+v8.033","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"139883601826a15b3bef41be3ff0bf7d8abfc443","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,152,131,96,24,38,161,91,59,239,65,190,63,240,191,125,138,191,196,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
