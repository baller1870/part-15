The Handbook discusses these, but abundantly treats the other side solitude that fosters insight, connection, creativity, introspection, healing, and enlightenment. This is a badly needed and broadly focused antidote for the negative approach, and its group of expert contributors provides a fuller understanding of a state people often experience, and sometimes need.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Peter Suedfeld, Dean Emeritus of Graduate Studies and Professor Emeritus of Psychology, The University of British Columbia\n\nThis large volume is a veritable feast of information and perspectives on the important topic of solitude. Scholars from diverse sub-disciplines of psychology (e.g., developmental, clinical, social, neuroscience, cultural psychology) and varied disciplines (e.g., sociology, anthropology, political science, religious studies, computer science, biology) weigh in on this complex topic. Even the most knowledgeable reader will learn much about types and potential causes and outcomes of solitude and be exposed to new theoretical frameworks.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Nancy Eisenberg, Regents Professor of Psychology, Arizona State University\n\n===================================================================================\nFrom the Back Cover\nOver the course of a lifespan, humans experience solitude for a wide variety of reasons and subjectively respond to seclusion with a wide range of reactions and consequences. A Handbook of Solitude: Psychological Perspectives on Social Isolation, Social Withdrawal, and Being Alone presents a comprehensive compilation of the most cutting edge psychological research related to the construct of solitude.\nFeaturing contributions from international experts in the field, readings explore aspects of solitary behavior from myriad psychological perspectives, including developmental, neuropsychological, social, personality, and clinical; during different developmental periods across the lifespan; and across a broad range of contexts, including various natural environments, college campuses, singlehood, meditation, and cyberspace. Other insights into solitude are garnered through extra-disciplinary researchers in fields such as biology, anthropology, sociology, political science, religious studies, and philosophy. Innovative and illuminating, this handbook represents the definitive treatment of the psychological concept of solitude as an area of study.\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nRobert J.
