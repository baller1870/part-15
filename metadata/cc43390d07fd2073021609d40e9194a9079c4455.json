Clearly, a hippie as opposed to a punk band, their album is a fine one, with their sound moulded by Conny Devanney's crystal clear vocals. On tracks like Dark World her voice is beautiful, while on others, notably the widely recorded High Flying Bird, Hung Up Chick and Walkin' And Singin', it blends in beautifully with that of her male counterpart, Richard Griggs. Also of note is the unusual People Of The Night and the sleepy Full Cycle. This album is strongly recommended.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc43390d07fd2073021609d40e9194a9079c4455","amp;dn":"Ill+Wind+-+Flashes+%281968+US+Psychedelic+Rock%29+%5BWAV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc43390d07fd2073021609d40e9194a9079c4455","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,67,57,13,7,253,32,115,2,22,9,212,14,145,148,169,7,156,68,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
