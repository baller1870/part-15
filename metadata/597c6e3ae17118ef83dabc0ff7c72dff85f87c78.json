Warned by Amy not to tell anyone about her, Allison is unable to talk about the situation with her father and business partner, Marv, or her younger brother, Brad. Unable to resist the strange woman's insistence that she will nudge her in the right direction in life, a reluctant Allison agrees to the friendship which, in the end, may turn out to be exactly what the doctor ordered.\r\nFirst episode date: January 7, 2016\r\nFinal episode date: February 4, 2016\r\nNetwork: CBS\r\nProgram creator: Tad Quill\r\nExecutive producers: Tad Quill, Don Scardino\r\nEpisodes\r\n5.
