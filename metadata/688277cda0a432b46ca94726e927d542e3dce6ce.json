Its state-of-the-art cinematography creates an intimate sense of place and captures a world of wonder, transporting viewers to isolated, undisturbed corners of the globe so pure they remind us of how the ancient world once was.\n\n\nNgorongoro - Africa Cradle of Life\nNearly three million years ago, a massive explosion tore apart an enormous statovolcano in Eastern Africa&amp;#039;s Great Rift Valley to form the Ngorongoro Crater, one of the true wonders of the world. Today, the Ngorongoro Crater is a microcosm of African life enclosed in one unique place. From grasslands, wetlands and lakes to forests and slopes, the crater provides habitats for Africa&amp;#039;s creatures both great and small. This Living Eden is a glorious stage where lions, hyenas, cheetahs, jackals, vultures, servals and wildebeest act out a dramatic story of life and death that was set into motion so long ago.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: X264\nVideo Bitrate: 2050 KB/s\nAverage Quants:\n* I:16.50 to 17.50\n* P:17.50 to 18.50\n* B:19.00 to 20.00\nVideo Resolution 1 - 14: 640 x 464 (4:3)\nVideo Resolution 15 - 24: 688 x 368 (16:9)\nAudio Codec: AAC\nAudio BitRate: 128 KB/s\nAudio Channels: 2 Ch\nRunTime: 00:47\nFramerate: 25 FPS\nNumber Of Parts: 24\nPart Size: 744 MB\nEncoded by: gavin63\nSubtitles: No TV Cap\nSource: DVB\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1) Related Documentaries \n* Planet Earth\n* Greatest Places\n* The Living Planet\n\n\n\nSource: http://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=The_Living_Edens","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:688277cda0a432b46ca94726e927d542e3dce6ce","amp;dn":"National+Geographic+The+Living+Edens+15of24+Ngorongoro+DVB+x264+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"688277cda0a432b46ca94726e927d542e3dce6ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,130,119,205,160,164,50,180,108,169,71,38,233,39,213,66,227,220,230,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
