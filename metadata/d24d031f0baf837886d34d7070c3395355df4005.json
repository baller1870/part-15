Her own family continues to live life in relative peace and quiet. Despite reservations, the couple get married and spend one night in Yokohama before Takano ships out.\n\nMeanwhile, tensions between the Federation and the Alliance (fictional stand-ins for the US and NATO against the USSR/Warsaw Pact, respectively) build up, especially after an intelligence-gathering vessel is captured. A new Korean War breaks out across the 38th parallel, but is quickly stopped. Although Japan calls on both sides to seek peace, government officials think that the country could be ripe for Alliance retaliation in light of its open support for the Federation. Dogfights between Federation and Alliance fighters over the Arctic (with both sides using nuclear-tipped air-to-air missiles) are just the beginning of a renewed conflict. The Alliance tips the scales by launching ICBMs on Japan and the West, with several cities totally destroyed. The Federation responds with their own nuclear strikes.\n\nAs Takano's ship arrives at the remains of a decimated Tokyo, a children's song plays in the background.\n\n\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 720x278, 29.97 fps, 2449 kbps, 01h50m00s\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, 4 channel, 192 kbps\n\nDVDRip, original Japanese audio, optional English subtitles\n\nscreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AAAdIaAGD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AAAdIaAGD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aaADkaAgd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aaADkaAgd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AaAdlaagd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AaAdlaagd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aaAdmaaGD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aaAdmaaGD&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d24d031f0baf837886d34d7070c3395355df4005","amp;dn":"The+Last+War+-+1961+%28Japan+-+%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E5%A4%A7%E6%88%A6%E4%BA%89%29+Eng+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d24d031f0baf837886d34d7070c3395355df4005","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,77,3,31,11,175,131,120,134,211,77,112,112,195,57,83,85,223,64,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
