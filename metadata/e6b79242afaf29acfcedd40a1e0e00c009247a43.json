The Experience Hendrix version of this material (available on the DVD &quot;Band of Gypsys / Live at the Fillmore East&quot;) cuts from a camera shot AFTER the shake or jiggle.\r\n2) The two original cameras had different contrast and brightness settings. The Experience Hendrix version cuts from a dark shot to a hazy light shot without having blended the brightness or contrast to be matching between the two cameras. Here adjustments are made to balance the two cameras together.\r\n3) Some of the Experience Hendrix footage looks to have been partially deteriorated due to improper storage. The source tapes used here (very low gen) appear to have been taken from an earlier transfer of the masters (before the deterioration had taken place).\r\n01. Who Knows\r\n02. Machine Gun\r\n03.
