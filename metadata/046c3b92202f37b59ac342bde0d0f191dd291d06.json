But it's not cool to talk like a geek. Even a Geek Can Speak shows anyone how to express complex ideas in ways that are simple, that connect with listeners, and that persuade.\n\nFocusing Your Message: One internet security executive won over non-technical business owners by focusing on the importance of internet security to the business world. Result: Listeners said - I'm buying that stock.\n\nKeeping it Simple: A software consultant steered clear of the technical details when pitching to a CEO and focused on three key points: saving money, security and competitiveness. Result: He won the business.\n\nTelling Stories: A telecommunications saleswoman spoke to a users' group and illustrated her points with stories, rather than dwelling too much in detail. Result: A jump in new orders.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:046c3b92202f37b59ac342bde0d0f191dd291d06","amp;dn":"Even+a+Geek+Can+Speak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"046c3b92202f37b59ac342bde0d0f191dd291d06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,108,59,146,32,47,55,181,154,195,66,189,224,208,241,145,221,41,29,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
