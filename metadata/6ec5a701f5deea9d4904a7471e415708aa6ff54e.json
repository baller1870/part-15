The album was one of the first of its kind and in a way became the grandfather of modern neo-classical metal, and his future albums would definitely help in some way to mold modern power metal as well. It was not like many of his others in the sense that it was predominately instrumental, and Marching Out was his first recording that focused a full band, although his guitar playing is still the most prominent.\r\n\r\nThe album itself is one of his best works and features not only impressive playing but strong vocals from Jeff Scott Soto and complex keyboard work from Jens Johansson. The songwriting lyrically is quite a bit lacking in an actual purpose in many of the songs, and in my opinion is one of the worst albums lyrically for Malmsteen, as they tend to be corny and confusing. Aside from the lyrical aspect, most of the album musically is great, and for the most part all have their own flavor they give to the album.\r\n\r\nTrack List\r\n\r\n1. \t&quot;Prelude&quot;   \t\r\n2. \t&quot;I'll See the Light, Tonight&quot;   \t\r\n3. \t&quot;Don't Let It End&quot;   \t\r\n4. \t&quot;Disciples of Hell&quot;   \r\n5. \t&quot;I Am a Viking&quot;   \t\r\n6. \t&quot;Overture 1383&quot;   \t\r\n7. \t&quot;Anguish and Fear&quot; \r\n8. \t&quot;On the Run Again&quot;   \t\r\n9. \t&quot;Soldier Without Faith&quot;   \t\r\n10. \t&quot;Caught in the Middle&quot;   \t\r\n11. \t&quot;Marching Out&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ec5a701f5deea9d4904a7471e415708aa6ff54e","amp;dn":"Yngwie+J+Malmsteen+-+Marching+Out","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ec5a701f5deea9d4904a7471e415708aa6ff54e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,197,167,1,245,222,234,157,73,4,167,71,30,65,87,8,170,111,245,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
