Collaborating with other industry experts, the author covers the system architecture and infrastructure required for a CPAS, as well as important standards like OPC and the ISA-95 series of standards. This in-depth reference focuses on the differences between a CPAS and traditional automation systems. Implications on modern automation systems are outlined in theory and practice. This book is ideal for industrial engineers, as well as graduate students in control and automation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a106afe2e011a50779792055536691577bed546","amp;dn":"Collaborative+Process+Automation+Systems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a106afe2e011a50779792055536691577bed546","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,16,106,254,46,1,26,80,119,151,146,5,85,54,105,21,119,190,213,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
