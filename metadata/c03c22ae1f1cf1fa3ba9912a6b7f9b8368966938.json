Did you know that when you format an existing hard drive, your operating system doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t erase all the data? It only deletes the information about where the files are located on the drive. This means that your confidential information still resides on your hard drive and can be easily recovered with data recovery software. The only way to erase data completely is with a disk wiping solution. Make sure nobody recovers your deleted information and prevent identity theft with Paragon Disk Wiper.
