Strong performances (especially Jennifer Richman as Alice) and finely-tuned CG effects make this about as much like the Ã¢â‚¬Å“realÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ series as you could ask for. And, if all turns out well, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll eventually be twelve more just like it. (Hint: There's only the one epsiode)\n\nIn SD MP4 format, this is the only copy I could find on the web. The official site for Doctor Who 2009 is at this time offline and it would be a shame to lose this work of film forever. Please seed and I hope you enjoy the film.\n\nRuntime: Approx 70 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c49f0881b1a91da96de5cd3136c4453bc9e60bf3","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+Fire+and+Ice+%5B2009+Fan+Film+-+70+min+-+SD+-+MP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c49f0881b1a91da96de5cd3136c4453bc9e60bf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,159,8,129,177,169,29,169,109,229,205,49,54,196,69,59,201,230,11,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
