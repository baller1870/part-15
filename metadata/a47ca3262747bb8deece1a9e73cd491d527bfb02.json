There, she witnesses a world beyond humanityâ€™s sight, of frightful powers and chaos, where she is in deathâ€™s grip... before an irresistibly dangerous male saves herâ€”only to take her captive.\r\n\r\nFor she is a rare commodity in the shadowy realm sheâ€™s entered.\r\n\r\nKarina soon finds herself caught in a violent civil war where those with inhuman powers strive to destroy each other without mercy. And it becomes all too clear that she must make a choice: submit and become a pawn, or take hold of her own destiny and fight for survival against impossible odds","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a47ca3262747bb8deece1a9e73cd491d527bfb02","amp;dn":"Origins+by+Ilona+Andrews+%28ePub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a47ca3262747bb8deece1a9e73cd491d527bfb02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,124,163,38,39,71,187,141,238,206,26,158,115,205,73,29,82,123,251,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
