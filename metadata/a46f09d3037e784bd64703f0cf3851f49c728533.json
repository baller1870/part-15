It is no coincidence that these phenomena come together at the beginning of a new era. Radicals, Revolutionaries, and Terrorists provides a comprehensive survey of the intersection of radical social movements and political violence. \r\n\r\nThe book considers eight essential questions for understanding radicalism, including its origins, dynamics, and outcomes. Ranging across the globe from the 1500s to the present, the book examines cases as diverse as nineteenthâ€“century anarchists, the Nazis, Che Guevara, the Weather Underground, Chechen insurgents, the Earth Liberation Front, Alâ€“Qaeda, and the Arab Spring. Throughout, Colin J. Beck connects these cases to key social movements literature to demonstrate how using multiple areas of research results in better explanations. \r\n\r\nRadicals, Revolutionaries, and Terrorists is an essential companion for understanding the challenges facing governments and societies today. Its engaging style and original approach make it indispensable for students and scholars across the social sciences who are interested in social movements","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a46f09d3037e784bd64703f0cf3851f49c728533","amp;dn":"Radicals%2C+Revolutionaries+and+Terrorists+-+1st+Ed+%282015%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a46f09d3037e784bd64703f0cf3851f49c728533","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,111,9,211,3,126,120,75,214,71,3,240,207,56,81,244,156,114,133,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
