This may seem facile and obvious.  But when you see the extraordinary capability of what theater can do today it rivals the presence, depth and wonder of those CGI techniques which are so familiar to us as viewers of films.\n\nThe Stratford Theater production by Des McAnuff first appears as what Peter Brooke called The Empty Space:  a flat stage resembling a shard of the wrecked ship or perhaps the floor of a rough dwelling where the beams are left uneven at the edges.  All the action takes place here but stay tuned for the &quot;in house&quot; effects as the play progresses.\n\nThe story is well- known and the characters familiar if only for the production for film starring Helen Miren only two years ago.\n\nBut surprisingly, one character normally seen simply as Prospero's familiar &quot;takes stage&quot;  and becomes a major audience focal point.  You will see what I mean.\n\nThis is all to the director's credit.  And to Christopher Plummer who could see his role eclipsed bys Julyana Soelistyo as Ariel through sheer talent becoming a major role in this production the performance maintains an ensemble feel and spirit.\n\nFinally,  the one criticism I have is the use of a quick cutting television style shooting technique.  Contrast this with another torrent also made for television which I have on The Taming Of The Shrew which is here:\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7816861/The_Taming_of_the_Shrew_by_Wm_Shakespeare_%28Bard_Productions%29%28Kul&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7816861/The_Taming_of_the_Shrew_by_Wm_Shakespeare_%28Bard_Productions%29%28Kul&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nNotes written December 30th 2012\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2296593e04ca64d8646257bafa1c445e3767043","amp;dn":"The+Tempest+by+Wm+Shakespeare+%282012%29+starring+Christopher+Plumme","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2296593e04ca64d8646257bafa1c445e3767043","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,41,101,147,224,76,166,77,134,70,37,123,175,161,196,69,227,118,112,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
