Hogan\nStarring: Isla Fisher, Hugh Dancy, Joan Cusack, John Goodman\n\nA college grad lands a job as a financial journalist in New York City to support where she nurtures her shopping addiction and falls for a wealthy entrepreneur.\n\nNOTES:\nRight this is a rip of elektri4ka's dvdr he gave me.....THANK YOU !!\nI have used lynks audio to sync to this aswell....thanks for that.\nFirstly the video source for a TS is great like normally from the russians\nThe audio is pretty good a bit weak,but certainly heard alot worse....\nThe problem with lynks release was it was out of sync in few places,not by much except around the 42 min mark it goes\nway and there's video footage which as no audio for it .....Not knocking lynks in anyway,personally i think they do really\ngood releases and he's done most of the hard work getting this 95% synced up...so hats off to him.\n\nWORK DONE:\nWell firstly the intro is missing and the audio goes a little at the end so i created a new audio file using the intro and ending off the\noriginal russian audio track mixed with lynks audio inbetween .....\nOnce i created my audio file i needed to sync it to the video ....now most of it synced pretty easily but theres a part around the 42 min mark\nwhen it goes out like ever 10 secs or less.....i needed to make 17 cuts alone in the part.Also had to remove 10 secs or just under due to no audio for it.\nGot to be honest and say i did the best i could be have notice a slight oos in this part.....but it's only a few secs and i ain't going to redo it again for the\nsake of that\nNow once synced 20 + cuts later it was onto the video .....which was really good but i thought it was a touch too bright and also the rgb colours were\nslightly off...i fixed all that and also alter the gamma slightly,chroma slightly,add more contrast and also then used a contour filter.\nAll in all the release was a bit of a pain to do ....but i'm pretty happy with the outcome.\n\nScreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/shop/vlcsnap-369802.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/shop/vlcsnap-369802.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/shop/vlcsnap-371662.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/shop/vlcsnap-371662.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/shop/vlcsnap-372859.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/shop/vlcsnap-372859.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/shop/vlcsnap-373016.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/shop/vlcsnap-373016.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/shop/vlcsnap-373125.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/shop/vlcsnap-373125.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18f5c9483bcfa787c9652c21726b4509bc68def7","amp;dn":"Confessions+Of+A+Shopaholic+TS+XVID+-+STG%28No+Rars%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18f5c9483bcfa787c9652c21726b4509bc68def7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,245,201,72,59,207,167,135,201,101,44,33,114,107,69,9,188,104,222,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
