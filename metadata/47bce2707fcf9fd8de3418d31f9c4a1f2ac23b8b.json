Who in late February announced retirement from the world of chiptunes in order to concentrate on things other than music. While the retirement hasn't been claimed to be permanent he has said that &quot;I think that if I was to start writing music again I'd like to start fresh, learn an instrument, learn to sing or something similar.&quot;\n\nFrom an early age heavily influenced by the sights and sounds of the 8/16bit videogame era, he came to start sequencing music in late 2001 after deciding to rewrite the soundtracks to seminal Amiga 500 classics, notably 'Escape From The Planet Of The Robot Monsters' (however, it does seem he's the only one who's ever heard of it).\n\n\nFast forward half a decade and a mix of styles have emerged; primarily centering his efforts on a genre recently coined 'chipbreak' - sounding somewhat like a fusion between chip/jungle/breakcore/dnb and hardcore - Sabrepulse has also dipped his toe into crumply, glitchy idm and breakbeat. He played live regularly across the uk, records/performs as half of the glitch/sinecore duo ?GUSH OVEN? (alongside Smile For The Cameraman, Honey!) and is part of several diy/netlabels in the UK, US and Japan.\n\nHis final performance before his short-lived retirement was at the Newcastle carling academy 2 on the 17th March 2008, and he is since back on the chiptune circuit.\n\n\n------------- Release -------------\nSabrepulse made all of these albums available on his myspace; however the download links no longer work. Hence the reason for this torrent.\n\nIf you like it, help seed! \n\n:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47bce2707fcf9fd8de3418d31f9c4a1f2ac23b8b","amp;dn":"Sabrepulse+-+Discography+%28awesome+8bit+chip+music%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47bce2707fcf9fd8de3418d31f9c4a1f2ac23b8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,188,226,112,127,207,159,216,222,52,24,211,31,156,74,31,42,194,59,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
