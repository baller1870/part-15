The result, complete with a chorus of gentlemen of Japan as cartoon-like British peers, emphatically underscores the Englishness of the satire. The occasional non sequiturs, like a bunch of gentry dressed for Ascot and singing in Japanese, are loonily fun, and no more absurd than the fantasyland Japan that Gilbert andSullivan invented. The time frame, though, seems little more than an excuse for a smart black-and-white production design.\n\n\nThe show's main calling card is Eric Idle as Ko-Ko, the Lord High Executioner. Unfortunately, his star turn of a performance, like the production as a whole, is not as funny as it should be. There are loads of comic ideas, some of them \neffective (bellboys parading through the hotel lobby with &quot;No flirting&quot; signs), some dubious (Ko-Ko delivering a 1980s-updated &quot;little list&quot; song at a press conference), some worked beyond their shelf life (insanely posh accents). This video recording of a 1987 performance could have been better made; the chorus, badly miked, sounds as if it is far off-stage. The actors' heavy makeup and heavy mugging are reminders that the production wasn't originally created for the camera. Such staginess may take some getting used to, but it fits in nicely with the aggressive fakery characteristic of G&amp;S. This revisionist Mikado is probably best after you've experienced more straightforward approaches. --David Olivenbaum\n\n\nProduct Description\nThe irrepressible Eric Idle (Monty PythonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Flying Circus) teams up with the English National Opera in this hilarious performance of Gilbert and SullivanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s beloved comic opera, THE MIKADO. This rollicking version of Gilbert and SullivanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most popular tale relocates the action from ancient Japan to a 1920s English seaside resort. Here the rule of the Mikado is absolute--and often prone to whimsy. Ko-Ko (Eric Idle) is sentenced to death for the crime of flirting, but in a strange turn of events is instead named &quot;Lord High Executioner.&quot; A delightful farce ensues as Ko-Ko canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t behead anyone without first cutting off his own head. But by the second act, the Mikado demands an execution and Ko-Ko must delicately sing and dance his way around a messy situation involving the MikadoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s son and his secret love Yum Yum. One of the best loved gems in all of opera, this charming production of THE MIKADO adds a unique twist to the timeless music--especially with the madcap talent of Eric Idle in his opera debut!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69740c96679cea77b7b3032e94f3e6dd7a7e99b7","amp;dn":"Live+Theatre+-+The+Mikado+%28Starring+Eric+Idle%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69740c96679cea77b7b3032e94f3e6dd7a7e99b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,116,12,150,103,156,234,119,183,179,3,46,148,243,230,221,122,126,153,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
