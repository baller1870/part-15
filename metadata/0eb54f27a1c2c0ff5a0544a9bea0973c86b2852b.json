With the same passion he brought to the challenge of climate change, and with his decades of experience on the front lines of global policy, Al Gore surveys our planetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beclouded horizon and offers a sober, learned, and ultimately hopeful forecast in the visionary tradition of Alvin TofflerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Future Shock and John NaisbittÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Megatrends. In The Future, Gore identifies the emerging forces that are reshaping our world:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Ever-increasing economic globalization has led to the emergence of what he labels Ã¢â‚¬Å“Earth Inc.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€an integrated holistic entity with a new and different relationship to capital, labor, consumer markets, and national governments than in the past.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The worldwide digital communications, Internet, and computer revolutions have led to the emergence of Ã¢â‚¬Å“the Global Mind,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which links the thoughts and feelings of billions of people and connects intelligent machines, robots, ubiquitous sensors, and databases.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The balance of global political, economic, and military power is shifting more profoundly than at any time in the last five hundred yearsÃ¢â‚¬â€from a U.S.-centered system to one with multiple emerging centers of power, from nation-states to private actors, and from political systems to markets.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A deeply flawed economic compass is leading us to unsustainable growth in consumption, pollution flows, and depletion of the planetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strategic resources of topsoil, freshwater, and living species.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Genomic, biotechnology, neuroscience, and life sciences revolutions are radically transforming the fields of medicine, agriculture, and molecular scienceÃ¢â‚¬â€and are putting control of evolution in human hands.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ There has been a radical disruption of the relationship between human beings and the earthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ecosystems, along with the beginning of a revolutionary transformation of energy systems, agriculture, transportation, and construction worldwide.\n\nFrom his earliest days in public life, Al Gore has been warning us of the promise and peril of emergent truthsÃ¢â‚¬â€no matter how Ã¢â‚¬Å“inconvenientÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ they may seem to be. As absorbing as it is visionary, The Future is a map of the world to come, from a man who has looked ahead before and been proven all too right.\n\nPraise for The Future\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Magisterial . . .
