Kelly was renowned as an accompanist, but as he shows on a set including three of his originals and four familiar standards (including &quot;Softly, As in a Morning Sunrise&quot; and &quot;Willow Weep for Me&quot;), he was also a strong bop-based soloist too. A fine example of his talents. [Some reissues augment the program with a previously unreleased &quot;Do Nothin' Till You Hear from Me&quot; and the alternate take of &quot;Keep It Moving.&quot;&gt; (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01.
