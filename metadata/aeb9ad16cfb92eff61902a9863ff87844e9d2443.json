The prize is a beautiful new car. All Delia has to do now is appear in front of the camera in a commercial. All goes well until it becomes clear that Delia and her parents have very different ideas about what to do with the new car. Meanwhile, the contest's sponsor needs a radiant prize-winner with a gleaming smile. A wicked satire and a psychological portrait of a society perverted by its slavery to capitalism and consumerism.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aeb9ad16cfb92eff61902a9863ff87844e9d2443","amp;dn":"Cum.mi-am.petrecut.sfarsitul.lumii.2006.DVDRip.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aeb9ad16cfb92eff61902a9863ff87844e9d2443","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,185,173,22,207,185,46,255,97,144,42,152,99,255,135,132,78,157,36,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
