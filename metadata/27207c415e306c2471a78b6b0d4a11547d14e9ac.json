After being discharged, Colonel Ludlow decides to raise his three sons in the wilds of Montana, where they can grow up away from the government and society he has learned to despise. The three brothers mature and seem to have an unbreakable bond, until Susanna enters their lives. When Samuel, the youngest of the three, returns from college he brings with him his beautiful fiancÃƒÂ©e, Susanna. The eldest son, Alfred, soon finds himself in love with his brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fiancÃƒÂ©e, and things get worse when he discovers a growing passion between Susanna and Tristan. Colonel LudlowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite son, Tristan is willful and as wild as the mountains. As the brothers set out to fight a war in Europe, suspicion and jealousy threatens to tear apart their once indestructible bond.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110322/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110322/&lt;/a&gt;\nGenre: Drama | Romance | War | Western\niMDB Rating: 7,3/10 from 71 257 users\nDirector: Edward Zwick\nStarring: Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Aidan Quinn\n\n\nSource Used: Legends of the Fall 1994 720p BluRay DD5.1 x264-EbP\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ultraimg.com/images/xHsy.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ultraimg.com/images/xHsy.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ultraimg.com/images/jDlV6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ultraimg.com/images/jDlV6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ultraimg.com/images/bkU6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ultraimg.com/images/bkU6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ultraimg.com/images/HTRxJ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ultraimg.com/images/HTRxJ.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27207c415e306c2471a78b6b0d4a11547d14e9ac","amp;dn":"Legends+of+the+Fall+1994+720p+BRRip+x264-PLAYNOW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27207c415e306c2471a78b6b0d4a11547d14e9ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,32,124,65,94,48,108,36,113,167,139,107,13,74,17,84,125,20,233,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
