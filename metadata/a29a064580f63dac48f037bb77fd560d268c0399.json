The books center on some of the same themes as her better-known Young Wizards series; those who wield the Blue Fire have many of the same responsibilities as the wizards and fight the same battle against entropy. In So You Want to Be a Wizard Nita's wizardry manual is written by &quot;Hearnssen&quot;, a reference to the protagonist of The Door Into Fire, Herewiss s'Hearn (son of Hearn), so it may be that the Middle Kingdoms are part of the same sheaf of universes as the Young Wizards setting. Adding to this, one interdimensional portal in The Door into Fire appears to open over New York City. Unlike Duane's children's books, however, the Tale of the Five series deals openly with issues of alternative sexuality. Within the Middle Kingdoms, bisexuality and group marriage are the norm. Duane is working on the final volume. \n\nThe Door into Fire (1979)\nThe Door into Shadow (1984)\nThe Door into Sunset (1992)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a29a064580f63dac48f037bb77fd560d268c0399","amp;dn":"Diane+Duane+-+The+Tale+of+the+Five+Omnibus+%28epub%2C+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a29a064580f63dac48f037bb77fd560d268c0399","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,154,6,69,128,246,61,172,72,240,55,187,119,253,86,13,38,140,3,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
