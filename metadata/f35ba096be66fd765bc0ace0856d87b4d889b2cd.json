He warns of the danger, rooted in the fact that modernity no longer dares to think God, of talking God to death, of silencing God with too much God-talk. JÃƒÂ¼ngel analyzes what our possibilities are of thinking and speaking God and concludes that theology has to become the narrative of God's humanity. This second book in the series helps the reader to gain a more explicit awareness of the contemporary issues JÃƒÂ¼ngel's theology grapples with.\n\nAbout the Author\nEberhard JÃƒÂ¼ngel is Professor of Systematic Theology and Philosophy of Religion, University of TÃƒÂ¼bingen, Germany.\n\nCONTENTS\nForeword to the First and Second Editions vii\nForeword to the Third Edition xiii\nForeword to the English Text xv\nTranslator's Preface xxv\nAbbreviations xxvi\nI.
