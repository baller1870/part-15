His only company are a four-screen closed-circuit TV setup, the portraits on the walls, a bottle of Chivas Regal Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and a loaded pistol. At times addressing an imaginary judge in a court of public opinion, at other times speaking to an aide named Roberto, and sometimes just talking to himself, the former chief executive reflects, in a series of meandering monologues, on his humble Quaker upbringing, his school days, his family and a political career that reached all the way to the White House. Nixon rails at his treatment by the likes of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“goddam Kennedys,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ J.
