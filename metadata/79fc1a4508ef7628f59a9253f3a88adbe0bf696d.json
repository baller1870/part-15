Shattering decades of dogma, scientists began publishing studies in 2008 showing that Ã¢â‚¬Å“fluid intelligenceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€the ability to learn, solve novel problems, and get to the heart of thingsÃ¢â‚¬â€can be increased through training.\n\nBut is it all just hype? With vivid stories of lives transformed, science journalist Dan Hurley delivers practical findings for people of every age and ability. Along the way, he narrates with acidtongued wit his experiences as a human guinea pig, road-testing commercial brain-training programs, learning to play the Renaissance lute, getting physically fit, even undergoing transcranial directcurrent stimulation.\n\nSmarter speaks to the audience that made bestsellers out of Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain and Moonwalking with Einstein.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kurzweilai.net/images/Smarter.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kurzweilai.net/images/Smarter.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAbout the Author :-\n\n\nDAN HURLEY is an award-winning science journalist whose 2012 feature in the New York Times Magazine, &quot;Can You Make Yourself Smarter?&quot; was one of the magazine's most-read articles of the year. In 2013 he published another article for the magazine, &quot;Jumper Cables for the Mind,&quot; describing his experience with transcranial direct-current stimulation. He has written on the science of increasing fluid intelligence for the Washington Post and Neurology, and is featured in the 2013 PBS documentary, &quot;Smarter Brains.&quot; His books have been excerpted in Wired and Discover magazine.
