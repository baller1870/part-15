KiÃ…Â¡ was influenced by Bruno Schulz, Vladimir Nabokov, Jorge Luis Borges, Ivo AndriÃ„â€¡ and Miroslav KrleÃ…Â¾a, among other authors. His most famous works include A Tomb for Boris Davidovich and The Encyclopedia of the Dead.\n\nKiÃ…Â¡ was influenced especially by Jorge Luis Borges: he had been accused of plagiarizing Borges (and James Joyce) in A Tomb for Boris Davidovich, which prompted a &quot;scathing response&quot; in The Anatomy Lesson (1978), and the influence of Borges is recognized in The Encyclopedia of the Dead. From Bruno Schulz, the Polish writer and prose stylist, KiÃ…Â¡ picked up &quot;mythic elements&quot; for The Encyclopedia of the Dead, and he reportedly told John Updike that &quot;Schulz is my God&quot;.\n\nBranko Gorjup sees two distinct periods in KiÃ…Â¡'s career as a novelist. The first, which includes Psalm 44, Garden, Ashes, and Early Sorrows, is marked by realism: KiÃ…Â¡ creates characters whose psychology &quot;reflect[s] the external world of the writer's memories, dreams, and nightmares, or his experiences of the time and space in which he lives&quot;. The worlds he constructed in his narratives, while he distanced himself from pure mimesis, were still constructed to be believable. The separation from mimesis he sought to achieve by a kind of deception through language, a process intended to instill &quot;'doubts' and 'trepidations' associated with a child's growing pains and early sorrows. The success of this 'deception' depended upon the effect of 'recognition' on the part of the reader&quot;. The point, for KiÃ…Â¡, was to make the reader accept &quot;the illusion of a created reality&quot;.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains following books, all in ePUB format:\n\n* Psalm 44 (Dalkey Archive Press)\n\n* The Attic (Dalkey Archive Press)\n\n* The Lute and the Scars (Dalkey Archive Press)\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danilo_Ki%C5%A1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danilo_Ki%C5%A1&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dalkeyarchive.com/a-conversation-with-danilo-kis-by-brendan-lemon/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dalkeyarchive.com/a-conversation-with-danilo-kis-by-brendan-lemon/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7254455f99860d2baf9d418454eceb8d935e4374","amp;dn":"Danilo+Kis+-+Serbian+%26amp%3B+Yugoslavian+Author+%283+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7254455f99860d2baf9d418454eceb8d935e4374","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,84,69,95,153,134,13,43,175,157,65,132,84,236,235,141,147,94,67,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
