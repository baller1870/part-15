The skill and speed of the player along with his common sense will be the keys to victory. The player will be able to choose from a wide variety of different games in single player or multi-player campaign mode or as missions. First, the player will choose which side he wants to play with, whether with the angels or with the devils. He will choose the members of his team from all types of angel/devil available. Once the game is under way, he must achieve the objectives set, which may be very varied, depending on the type of game selected. But there is something that always stays the same: you must defeat the enemy. The player will start to play with one of the members of his team, although he will be able to change to another other type with a simple keystroke whenever he wants. The controls are identical to most current action games, with free third-person camera, and choice of keyboard, keyboard + mouse, gamepad or joystick. During the game, the player will fight against opponents with blows or using his powers. Using his skill to avoid the obstacles; running, jumping and flapping (gliding), he will look for items to achieve new advantages and accumulate points to be able to buy all sorts of tools in the shop between different missions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4430ae5b40b10ed5b54fa3445d80ff32c01d20be","amp;dn":"Angels+VS+Devils","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4430ae5b40b10ed5b54fa3445d80ff32c01d20be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,48,174,91,64,177,14,213,181,79,163,68,93,128,255,50,192,29,32,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
