She has won 12 Juno Awards and seven Grammy Awards, and has sold over 55 million albums worldwide.[1][2] Morissette began her career in Canada, and as a teenager recorded two dance-pop albums, Alanis and Now Is the Time, under MCA Records. Her international debut album was the rock-influenced Jagged Little Pill, which remains the best-selling debut album by a female artist in the U.S., and the highest selling debut album worldwide in music history, selling 30 million records worldwide.[3][4] According to RIAA and United World Charts, Alanis is the biggest selling female rock artist in music. Her following album, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, was released in 1998 and was a success as well. Morissette took up producing duties for her subsequent albums, which include Under Rug Swept, So-Called Chaos and latest release Flavors of Entanglement. In February 2005, Morissette became a naturalized citizen of the United States while maintaining her Canadian citizenship. [5]\n\n\n\n\n\nJagged Little Pill:\n\n\nJagged Little Pill is the third studio album (and the first to be released internationally) by Canadian singer and songwriter Alanis Morissette. Released on June 13, 1995, the record quickly broke into the mainstream.\n\nThe album garnered great success, spending twelve non-consecutive weeks at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart, and became one of three albums ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ along with Thriller by Michael Jackson and Falling into You by CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©line Dion ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ to remain in the Top Ten for over a year.\n\nMedia Traffic lists Jagged Little Pill as the tenth best-selling album of all time.[1] It was the second-best-selling album of the 1990s, behind Shania Twain&amp;#039;s Come on Over,[2] with twenty-eight million copies sold by 2000. By January 2005, the album had sold 30 million units worldwide.[3]\n\nIn October 2002, Rolling Stone ranked it number 31 on its Women In Rock - The 50 Essential Albums list, and in 2003 the magazine ranked it number 327 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[4]\n\n\n\n\nBackground and production:\n\n\nIn 1993, after leaving MCA Records Canada, Morissette moved from her home town of Ottawa to Toronto. Living alone for the first time in her life, she met with a bevy of songwriters, but the results frustrated her. A visit to Nashville a few months later also proved fruitless. Morissette began making trips to Los Angeles and working with as many musicians as possible, in the hopes of meeting a collaborator. During this time, she met producer and songwriter Glen Ballard. According to Ballard, the connection was &quot;instant&quot;, and within thirty minutes of meeting each other they had begun experimenting with different sounds in Ballard&amp;#039;s home studio in San Fernando Valley, California. Ballard and Morissette penned their first song together, called &quot;The Bottom Line&quot;. The turning point in their sessions was the song &quot;Perfect&quot;, which was written and recorded in twenty minutes. Morissette improvised the lyrics on the spot, and Ballard played guitar. The version of the song that appeared on Jagged Little Pill was the only take that the pair recorded.\n\nMorissette later revealed that during her stay in L.A., she was robbed on a deserted street by a man with a gun. The writings and brainstormings that eventually made up Jagged Little Pill had not been taken from her purse. After the robbery, Morissette developed an intense and general angst and suffered daily panic attacks. She was hospitalized and attended psychotherapy sessions, but it didn&amp;#039;t improve her emotional status. As Morissette later revealed in interviews, she focused all her inner problems on the soul-baring lyrics of the album for her own health. According to Morissette, Ballard was the first collaborator who encouraged her to express her emotions.\n\nThe demo recording sessions started in 1994 at Ballard&amp;#039;s home studio and included only Morissette and the producer, who recorded the songs as they were being written. Ballard provided the rough tracks, playing the guitars, keyboards and programming drum machines, and Morissette played harmonica. The duo sought to write and record one song a day, in twelve- or sixteen-hour shifts, with minimal overdubbing later. All of Morissette&amp;#039;s singing on the album respects that rule, and it was recorded in one or two takes each. The tracks that were redone later in a professional studio use the original demo vocals.\n\nThe first song to be shown to A&amp;R and record company people was &quot;Perfect&quot;, with a simple arrangement containing only Morissette&amp;#039;s vocals and Ballard&amp;#039;s acoustic guitar. In 1995, around the time that Morissette penned a deal with Maverick Records, the couple took the demos to a studio and started building some new band arrangements for some of them. During the overdub sessions, Flea and Dave Navarro (then Red Hot Chili Peppers bandmates) appeared at the studio, discovered Morissette&amp;#039;s work, and offered to play on &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;.\n\nThere are seven known outtakes from the recording sessions: &quot;Keep The Radio On&quot;, &quot;Bottom Line&quot;, &quot;Beautiful Intent&quot;, &quot;Aura&quot;, &quot;No Avalon&quot;, &quot;Superstar Wonderful Weirdos&quot;, and an alternate take of &quot;Ironic&quot; with a lyric change (&quot;It&amp;#039;s like ice cream on a freezing day&quot; instead of &quot;It&amp;#039;s a black fly in your chardonnay\n\n\n\n\nRelease and reception:\n\n\nMaverick Records released Jagged Little Pill in June 1995. Because expectations for the album were low, Scott Welsh (Morissette&amp;#039;s manager and long-time friend) and executives at Maverick did not expect the album to sell more than 250,000 copies.[5] It debuted at number 113 on the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart.\n\nThings quickly changed when a Los Angeles DJ from the influential radio station KROQ began playing &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, the album&amp;#039;s first single.[5] The song instantly garnered attention, and a subsequent music video went into heavy rotation on MTV. The subject of the song, an ex-boyfriend (widely rumored to be Dave Coulier of television&amp;#039;s Full House fame[citation needed]), became the most guessed-about antagonist since that of Carly Simon&amp;#039;s &quot;You&amp;#039;re So Vain&quot;. However, it was the hit singles that followed that sent Jagged Little Pill to the top. &quot;Hand in My Pocket&quot; was released as the second single, and then &quot;Ironic&quot;, which became Morissette&amp;#039;s biggest hit. &quot;You Learn&quot; and &quot;Head over Feet&quot;, the next two singles, kept Jagged Little Pill in the top twenty on the Billboard 200 for over a year. Outside the U.S., &quot;All I Really Want&quot; was released in 1997 as the album&amp;#039;s last single, and in Europe &quot;You Learn&quot; was released before &quot;Ironic&quot;.\n\nAccording to the RIAA, Jagged Little Pill is the best-selling debut album of all time by a female artist, with 14.6 million copies sold in the U.S. as of September 2008.[6] As of 2005, it had sold thirty million copies worldwide.[3] It was officially the best-selling album in the United States of the 1990s, with (according to Nielsen SoundScan) 13.5 million over-the-counter-sales by January 1, 2000. In Ireland, when Morissette&amp;#039;s sixth album Under Rug Swept was released in 2002, Jagged Little Pill re-entered the album chart on February 21 at number seventy-two[7] and reached nineteen on March 7.[8] It took nine weeks for it to depart the chart again, on May 2.\n\nMorissette was attacked for collaborating with producer and supposed image-maker Ballard, Her early dance-pop albums also proved a hindrance for her respectability, particularly in her native country. The album was nominated for six Grammy Awards in 1996, and Morissette won &quot;Best Female Rock Vocal Performance&quot;, &quot;Best Rock Song&quot;, &quot;Best Rock Album&quot;, and &quot;Album of the Year&quot; (she lost &quot;Best New Artist&quot; and &quot;Song of the Year&quot;). Later that year, she embarked on an eighteen-month world tour in support of Jagged Little Pill, beginning in small clubs and ending in large venues. In 1997 she was nominated for two more Grammy Awards: &quot;Record of the Year&quot; and &quot;Best Music Video, Short Form&quot; for &quot;Ironic&quot;. The video Jagged Little Pill, Live, which chronicled the bulk of the tour, won a 1998 Grammy Award for &quot;Best Long Form Music Video&quot;. In 1998, on Rolling Stone magazine&amp;#039;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nIn 2005 Morissette re-released an acoustic version of the album, Jagged Little Pill Acoustic, on the tenth anniversary of the original album&amp;#039;s release. This album was originally sold through Starbucks&amp;#039; Hear Music brand in an exclusive six-week deal that ended on July 26, 2005. For the duration of this partnership, music retailer HMV boycotted the sale of Morissette&amp;#039;s entire catalogue in Canada\n\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;All I Really Want&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:44 \n2.\t&quot;You Oughta Know&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09 \n3.\t&quot;Perfect&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:07 \n4.\t&quot;Hand in My Pocket&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:41 \n5.\t&quot;Right Through You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:55 \n6.\t&quot;Forgiven&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:00 \n7.\t&quot;You Learn&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59 \n8.\t&quot;Head over Feet&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:27 \n9.\t&quot;Mary Jane&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:40 \n10.\t&quot;Ironic&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49 \n11.\t&quot;Not the Doctor&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47 \n12.\t&quot;Wake Up&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:53 \n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d35b05e522346dbe6a1ca74fdb0da0afff3854e5","amp;dn":"Alanis+Morissette+-+Jagged+Little+Pill+1995+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d35b05e522346dbe6a1ca74fdb0da0afff3854e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,91,5,229,34,52,109,190,106,28,167,79,219,13,160,175,255,56,84,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
