But psychoÃ‚Â­paths account for a vastly outsized proportion of violent crimes. And as Kiehl shows, many who arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t psychopaths exhibit some of the behaviors and traits associated with the condition. What do you do if you discover your roommate, or boss, or the person you are dating has traits that define a psyÃ‚Â­chopath? And what does having a diminished limbic region of the brain mean for how the legal system approaches crimes committed by psychopaths? \n\n A compelling narrative of cutting-edge science, The Psychopath Whisperer will open your eyes on a fascinating but little understood world, with startling implications for society, the law, and our personal lives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b9ca2b174a82d209c53601286778fa7194636ac","amp;dn":"The+Psychopath+Whisperer+%282014%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b9ca2b174a82d209c53601286778fa7194636ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,156,162,177,116,168,45,32,156,83,96,18,134,119,143,167,25,70,54,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
