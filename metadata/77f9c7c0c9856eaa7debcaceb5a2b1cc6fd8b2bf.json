I mean come on, it's only got 30 votes on IMDB and has been out for nearing 20 years!\n\nIMDB Info: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0844321/\n\n\nDon't forget guys, same as always, comment, seed and enjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77f9c7c0c9856eaa7debcaceb5a2b1cc6fd8b2bf","amp;dn":"Ogroff%3A+The+Mad+Mutilator+%281983%29+-+Hard+Eng+Subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77f9c7c0c9856eaa7debcaceb5a2b1cc6fd8b2bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,249,199,192,201,133,110,170,125,235,202,206,181,162,177,204,111,216,178,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
