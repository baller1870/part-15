But hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the truth: You are not so smart. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re just as deluded as the rest of usÃ¢â‚¬â€but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s okay, because being deluded is part of being human. \n\nGrowing out of David McRaneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s popular blog, You Are Not So Smart reveals that every decision we make, every thought we contemplate, and every emotion we feel comes with a story we tell ourselves to explain them. But often these stories arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t true. Each short chapterÃ¢â‚¬â€covering topics such as Learned Helplessness, Selling Out, and the Illusion of TransparencyÃ¢â‚¬â€is like a psychology course with all the boring parts taken out. \n\nBringing together popular science and psychology with humor and wit, You Are Not So Smart is a celebration of our irrational, thoroughly human behavior.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6be899d4516064300d7be7995222e5c4abced0c9","amp;dn":"You+Are+Not+So+Smart+by+David+McRaney","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6be899d4516064300d7be7995222e5c4abced0c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,232,153,212,81,96,100,48,13,123,231,153,82,34,229,196,171,206,208,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
