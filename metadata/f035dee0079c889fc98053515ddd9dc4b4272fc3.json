It is often considered, along with The Three Musketeers, as Dumas' best work, and is frequently included on lists of the best novels of all time. The writing of the work was completed in 1844. According to the introductory biography in the Penguin Books publication of the novel, Dumas collaborated with others such as Auguste Maquet in the writing to suggest plots and/or historical background for the novel.\n\nThe story takes place in France, Italy, and islands in the Mediterranean during the historical events of 1815 (from just before the Hundred Days through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France). It is primarily concerned with themes of justice, vengeance, mercy and forgiveness, and is told in the style of an adventure story.\n\nDumas got the idea for The Count of Monte Cristo from a true story, which he found in a memoir written by a man named Jacques Peuchet. Peuchet related the story of a shoemaker named Pierre Picaud, who was living in Paris in 1807. Picaud was engaged to marry a rich woman, but four jealous friends falsely accused him of being a spy for England. He was imprisoned for seven years. During his imprisonment a dying fellow prisoner bequeathed him a treasure hidden in Milan. When Picaud was released in 1814, he took possession of the treasure, returned under another name to Paris and spent ten years plotting his successful revenge against his former friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n========================================\nContents | Track titles\n========================================\n\n0100 Books on Tape - The Count of Monte Cristo - Alexandre Dumas\n\n0101 _ Ch 01 _ The Arrival at Marseilles\n0105 _ Ch 02 _ Father and Son\n0108 _ Ch 03 _ The Catalans\n0112 _ Ch 04 _ The Plotters\n0115 _ Ch 05 _ The Betrothal Feast\n0207 _ Ch 06 _ The Deputy Procureur\n0212 _ Ch 07 _ The Examination\n0301 _ Ch 08 _ The Chateau d'If\n0305 _ Ch 09 _ The Evening of the Betrothal\n0307 _ Ch 10 _ The Little Room in the Tuileries\n0311 _ Ch 11 _ The Corsican Ogre\n0315 _ Ch 12 _ Father and Son\n0401 _ Ch 13 _ The Hundred Days\n0404 _ Ch 14 _ In the Dungeons\n0408 _ Ch 15 _ Number 34 and Number 27\n0415 _ Ch 16 _ A Learned Italian\n0506 _ Ch 17 _ In the Abbe's Cell\n0517 _ Ch 18 _ The Treasure\n0607 _ Ch 19 _ The Death of the Abbe\n0612 _ Ch 20 _ The Cemetery of the Chateau d'If\n0614 _ Ch 21 _ The Isle of Tiboulen\n0703 _ Ch 22 _ The Smugglers\n0707 _ Ch 23 _ The Isle of Monte Cristo\n0711 _ Ch 24 _ The Search\n0715 _ Ch 25 _ At Marseilles Again\n0802 _ Ch 26 _ The Inn of Pont Du Gard\n0810 _ Ch 27 _ The Tale\n0817 _ Ch 28 _ The Prison Registers\n0904 _ Ch 29 _ The House of Morrel and Son\n0909 _ Ch 30 _ The Fifth of September\n0916 _ Ch 31 _ Italy _ Sinbad the Sailor\n1010 _ Ch 32 _ The Awakening\n1013 _ Ch 33 _ Roman Bandits\n1106 _ Ch 34 _ Vampa\n1110 _ Ch 35 _ The Colosseum\n1206 _ Ch 36 _ La Mazzolata\n1213 _ Ch 37 _ The Carnival at Rome\n1304 _ Ch 38 _ The Catacombs of Saint Sebastian\n1311 _ Ch 39 _ The Rendezvous\n1315 _ Ch 40 _ The Guests\n1401 _ Ch 41 _ The Breakfast\n1410 _ Ch 42 _ The Presentation\n1415 _ Ch 43 _ Monsieur Bertuccio\n1501 _ Ch 44 _ The House at Auteuil\n1504 _ Ch 45 _ The Vendetta\n1513 _ Ch 46 _ The Rain of Blood\n1604 _ Ch 47 _ Unlimited Credit\n1611 _ Ch 48 _ The Dappled Grays\n1618 _ Ch 49 _ Ideology\n1706 _ Ch 50 _ Haydee\n1708 _ Ch 51 _ The Morrel Family\n1712 _ Ch 52 _ Pyramus and Thisbe\n1803 _ Ch 53 _ Toxicology\n1811 _ Ch 54 _ Robert Le Diable\n1903 _ Ch 55 _ A Talk About Stocks\n1908 _ Ch 56 _ Major Cavalcanti\n1912 _ Ch 57 _ Andrea Cavalcanti\n2002 _ Ch 58 _ At the Gate\n2007 _ Ch 59 _ M.
