American singer Marc (Lanza) gets into a fight with his girlfriend, Carol (Peggie Castle). He follows her to Rome in an attempt to win back her affections. On the train, he meets an Italian woman named Rafaella Marini (Marisa Allasio), who is supposed to be moving in with her uncle. Marc gives her a ride and they discover that the uncle has left for South America. With nowhere to go, Rafaella stays with Marc and his cousin Pepe Bonelli (Renato Rascel), which leads to eventual romance. The narrative allows for Lanza to do his serviceable impressions of popular singers like Perry Como, Dean Martin, Louis Armstrong, and many others. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050140/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050140/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Lanza&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Lanza&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDirector:\nRoy Rowland\n\n\n        Mario Lanza\t ... \tMarc Revere\n\tRenato Rascel\t... \tPepe Bonelli\n\tMarisa Allasio\t... \tRafaella Marini\n\tPeggie Castle\t... \tCarol Ralston\n\tClelia Matania\t... \tBeatrice\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:38:57\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 704x528\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1105 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,12 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ade1d9de0f7a299fa9a49e0d76f2da474c4006a1","amp;dn":"Arrivederci+Roma+%281958%29+%28Seven+Hills+of+Rome%29+Mario+Lanza","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ade1d9de0f7a299fa9a49e0d76f2da474c4006a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,225,217,222,15,122,41,159,169,164,158,13,118,242,218,71,76,64,6,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
