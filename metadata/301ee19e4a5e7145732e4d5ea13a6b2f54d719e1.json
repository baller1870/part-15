Titillating text messages. It's-not-you-it's-me relationship-enders. In Other PeopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Love Letters, Bill Shapiro has searched AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attics, closets, and cigar boxes and found actual lettersÃ¢â‚¬â€œunflinchingly honest missives full of lust, provocation, guilt, and vulnerabilityÃ¢â‚¬â€œwritten only for a loverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eyes. Modern love, of course, is not all bliss, and in these pages youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find the full range of a relationship, with its whispered promises as well as its heartache. But what at first appears to be a deliciously voyeuristic peek into other peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most passionate moments, will ultimately reawaken your own desires and tendernessÃ¢â‚¬Â¦because when you read these letters, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find the heart youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking into is actually your own.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ &quot;i think UR great. wanna have wine &amp; Tequila again sometime?&quot;\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ &quot;I can't believe you're real, and I think about you constantly in some way or the other all day. I haven't given the finger to anyone driving since I met you.&quot;\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ &quot;With you I learned how to fight cleaner, how to talk things out better, and how to make a strong loving family out of nothing. These are priceless gifts that I will carry with me the rest of my life. One more thing you did for me: you left, and I had to get through it.&quot;\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ &quot;P.S. I look forward to your letters too much to call. Also, where do you stand on chains?&quot;\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:301ee19e4a5e7145732e4d5ea13a6b2f54d719e1","amp;dn":"Other+People%27s+Love+Letters%3A+150+Letters+You+Were+Never+Meant+to","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"301ee19e4a5e7145732e4d5ea13a6b2f54d719e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,30,225,158,74,94,113,69,115,46,77,94,161,58,107,47,84,215,25,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
