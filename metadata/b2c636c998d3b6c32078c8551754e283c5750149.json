For the first album, I was still in the service, so I had to fly in and out of Nashville to record when I could. This time around it had my undivided attention.&quot; \n\n-=Product Description=-\n\nAfter delivering a Gold-selling debut and three consecutive top 5 singles to country radio, &quot;American Idol&quot; favorite Josh Gracin will release his much anticipated sophomore album, We Weren&amp;#039;t Crazy, on April 1, 2008. \nJosh Gracin&amp;#039;s new CD, We Weren&amp;#039;t Crazy allows audiences to take a more personal look inside the life of the &quot;American Idol&quot; season 2 finalist and former Marine. Josh worked with producers Marty Williams and Brett James on the CD&amp;#039;s eleven tracks. \n\nGracin is admittedly most excited about his newest single, the title track, &quot;We Weren&amp;#039;t Crazy.&quot; The autobiographical song was written by Gracin, Tony Lopacinski, and Bobby Pinson about Gracin&amp;#039;s personal journey from childhood to raising children and having a family of his own. &quot;This time around I got to dig in and share my stories as a songwriter. I&amp;#039;m so proud of how this song turned out,&quot; he said. \n\nJosh Gracin&amp;#039;s debut album is certified gold by the RIAA and has sold over 695,000 copies. He&amp;#039;s one of only three new male country singers to be introduced in the last four years to earn a gold album. Josh is also the only male solo country artist in recent years to release a debut album with three consecutive Top 5 country hits, including his first #1, &quot;Nothin&amp;#039; To Lose.&quot; \n\n\n\nARTIST     : Josh Gracin\nTITLE      : We Weren&amp;#039;t Crazy\nLABEL      : Lyric Street Records\nGENRE      : Country\nBITRATE    : 224 kbps avg\nSOURCE     : CD (LP)\nPLAYTIME   : 00:42:36\nSIZE       : 71.9MB\nSTORE DATE : 2008-03-00\n\n\nTrack List\n----------\n1.
