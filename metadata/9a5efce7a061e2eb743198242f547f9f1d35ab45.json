Analogies are made with early polar exploration and the expeditions of Shackleton, Amundsen, and Mawson. The interplanetary plans of the European Space Agency, NASA, and Russia are examined, including the possibility of one or more nations joining forces to send humans to Mars. \n\n\nCurrent mission architectures, such as NASAÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Constellation, ESAÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Aurora, and Ross TierneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s DIRECT, are described and evaluated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a5efce7a061e2eb743198242f547f9f1d35ab45","amp;dn":"Martian+Outpost%3A+Establishing+a+Settlement+on+Mars","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a5efce7a061e2eb743198242f547f9f1d35ab45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,94,252,231,160,97,226,235,116,49,152,36,47,84,127,159,29,53,171,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
