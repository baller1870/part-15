From whores and highwaymen to courtiers and noblemen, from events such as the Great Plague and the Fire of London to the intimate passions of ordinaryÃ¢â‚¬â€and extraordinaryÃ¢â‚¬â€men and women, Amber experiences it all. But throughout her trials and escapades, she remains, in her heart, true to the one man she really loves, the one man she can never have. Frequently compared to Gone with the Wind, Forever Amber is the other great historical romance, outselling every other American novel of the 1940sÃ¢â‚¬â€despite being banned in Boston for its sheer sexiness. A book to read and reread, this edition brings back to print an unforgettable romance and a timeless masterpiece.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0ae29d496b47947fac036ecdf4a662ed5cb2128","amp;dn":"Forever+Amber+by+Kathleen+Winsor+%5Bebook+in+epub+%26amp%3B+mobi%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0ae29d496b47947fac036ecdf4a662ed5cb2128","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,174,41,212,150,180,121,71,250,192,54,236,223,74,102,46,213,203,33,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
