While in jail, he continued to engage in doubtful monetary transactions. As the rumors that he was being protected by high-ranking members of the government of the French Third Republic were undoubtedly true, the scandal had a profoundly unsettling effect on the French nation, already suffering from poor government handling of the Depression, and this incident nearly brought down both the government and the Republic. Stavisky's death in prison (an apparent suicide) triggered widespread unrest and rioting. In the movie, when Stavisky (Jean-Paul Belmondo) goes to jail as a young con-man, his embarrassed father commits suicide. Ruining countless lives in his stellar career as a big-money swindler, including that of his nobleman friend Raoul (Charles Boyer), Stavisky is shown to be a pawn in a still bigger swindle, one which will destroy the Left and open the way to fascism.\n\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98c1fa17f98a43c7347a3ca28cceeb0411eb3cfa","amp;dn":"Stavisky+1974+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98c1fa17f98a43c7347a3ca28cceeb0411eb3cfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,193,250,23,249,138,67,199,52,122,60,162,140,206,235,4,17,235,60,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
