Inspired by Monteverdi's Madrigals of Love and War, the new works touch on murder, rape and mutilation. And Jacques' vocals - his voice is the missing link between classical falsetto and Berlin cabaret - range from a Tom Waits growl to an angelic operatic warble as he rages against religious and political hypocrisy in times of war. Mark Fisher - The Scotsman\n\nWhat The Tiger Lillies have come up with - Songs of Love and War - is, on the evidence of the preview CD, both aural seduction and assault in the same breath. There is edgy beauty, rage and a sense of politics. Sarah Unwin Jones - The Herald\n\nThe Tiger Lillies (collaborating with David McGuinness of Concerto Caledonia) present their tribute to Monteverdi's Madrigals of Love and War. Harpsichord, Accordion, church organ and musical saw unite in songs of the futility of war.\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Love and War\n02 - Card Game\n03 - Kill you on a Monday\n04 - Glory in Battle\n05 - Devil\n06 - Love is a Luxury\n07 - River of Tears\n08 - Trancred and Clorindal\n09 - Kill You\n10 - Lover's Return\n11 - Winners and Losers\n12 - Nightingale\n13 - Enemies of Love\n14 - Love a Whore\n15 - Venus\n\nCredits:\nALL SONGS WRITTEN BY MARTYN JAQUES\nMARTYN JAQUES - VOCALS / ACCORDION / UKULELE / PIANO\nADRIAN STOUT - DOUBLE BASS / SINGING SAW / BACKING-VOCALS\nADRIAN HUGE - DRUMS / TOYS / BACKING-VOCALS\nDAVID McGUINESS - HARPSICHORD / ORGAN\n\nEnjoy and share!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad8acbe2b76d5a21bf295ba742271fb967081281","amp;dn":"Tiger+Lillies+-+2007+-+Love+and+War+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad8acbe2b76d5a21bf295ba742271fb967081281","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,138,203,226,183,109,90,33,191,41,91,167,66,39,31,185,103,8,18,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
