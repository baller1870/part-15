Inspired by open-front garments and textiles from around the globe--including Austria, England, Japan, Peru, and Norway--these figure-flattering designs bring a contemporary edge to a variety of knitting traditions. Step-by-step instructions and copious photographs illustrate how to use standard stockinette, garter, and cable stitches to create chic projects such as shepherd's frocks, tweed coats, Peruvian gauntlet wraps, and Faroese-patterned jackets. More advanced techniques for fanciful lace and colorwork and the history behind beach pattern is also included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bed29062e2e3c3704bdc59049809a9e3cf174165","amp;dn":"Knitted+Jackets%3A+20+Designs+from+Classic+to+Contemporary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bed29062e2e3c3704bdc59049809a9e3cf174165","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,210,144,98,226,227,195,112,75,220,89,4,152,9,169,227,207,23,65,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
