Obviously, both of them cannot be correct.\n\nRespected linguist David Daniels proves beyond a doubt how we can know the King James Bible is God's preserved words in English. He answers many of the difficult questions the so-called experts throw against the King James.\n\nWhether you want to defend the King James Bible or learn which Bible you can trust, you will find the answers here.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDavid Daniels, B.A., M.Div., is trained in Bible, theology and linguistics. After twenty years of searching the Hebrew and Greek scriptures and studying the history of the Bible, he concluded that the King James Bible is God's preserved words in English.
