rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Traps&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFrom the creator of the popular Deadly Venoms martial arts series comes the most diabolical entry of them all! The incredible Venoms, a team of skilled fighters, unleash their fury in a bloody frenzy when they infiltrate a mysterious, treasure-filled house designed to entrap and destroy all those who enter it-- as fiendishly and creatively as possible!\n One of the rarest and most-requested Shaw Brothers action masterpieces, now presented restored and uncut in all its outrageous glory!\n Includes the original Chinese language version (with English subtitles) as well as the extremely rare original English dubbed track!!\n (However, for those of you listening to the English dub, it's here, but it was those inferior UK voices who also messed up the English dub for &quot;Legendary Weapons of China.&quot; Just my opinion though.)\n  As I've written in other torrent descriptions, I'm a huge Shaw Brothers fan and Chang Cheh completist. Chang and his godsons, the Venoms, bid a fond farewell in 1981 to their four year/nineteen film series with this period piece (Sung Dynasty) martial epic.\n It's complete with the ubiquitous Chang Cheh traits like brotherhood, chivalry, greed, corruption, honor, copious bloodletting &amp; kung fu madness. I've read that it's a &quot;complete&quot; Venom film. Not really, it's missing Lo Mang, Wei Pai &amp; Johnny Wang (who was working with Lau Kar-Leung at the time).\n However, it does have his core Venoms like Kuo Chui, Lu Feng, the late Chiang Sheng, Wang Li, Sun Chien (who unfortunately doesn't flash his Iron Feet here), along with Yu Tai-Ping, Ricky Cheng, Chu Ke, Chien Hsiao-Hao &amp; &quot;Spearman&quot; Lung Tien-Sheng.\n\n First the movie; the trailer states that it's based on a novel. I did not know that, but that would explain its prologue, extended dialogue scenes &amp; a &quot;period&quot; plot concerning Prince Yang's quest for revenge against Lord Bao.\n This involves a revolt, stolen Imperial valuables which are secured in a building filled with lethal traps (the House of the title; one of the traps is a staircase where the stairs become blades) &amp; spies (who are responsible for the martial mayhem.) Many cool venomous fight scenes are tucked inside the complicated plot which also involves two opposing knight-errants, the Black Fox (Kuo Chui) &amp; Butterfly (Lu Feng), a group known as the Four Rats, a list &amp; a hidden painting that reveals the prince's dark past.\n All this intrigue concludes in a ten minute finale which is absolutely jaw-dropping. The Venoms really outdid themselves with the choreography pitting Wang Li (with double hook swords) versus Chu Ke &amp; Chiang Sheng and Lu Feng (using a spear &amp; darts) versus Kuo Chui (using a short-handled broadsword) which takes place in a huge opulent room decorated with ornate vases/furniture and curtains (kinda like the finale in &quot;Five Deadly Venoms&quot;).\n Amazing stuff here.\n\nSCREENSHOTS:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/wEfTu6c&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/wEfTu6c&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is personally brought to you by the Carjacker, from The Chop Shop.\nLeave your thoughts/opinions and ratings on the A/V of this film for others to see. Thanks! \n\nPease SEED as you DL so others may also enjoy the movie! \n\nNOTE: This torrent is seeded as a SUPERSEED (INTIAL SEEDING) by me, so, if you dont seed, you wont receive or receive at the optimum speed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4acf6546a73fd04459fb21a65c9ff8f45b5714b8","amp;dn":"House+Of+Traps+%5B1982%5D.x264.DVDrip%28ShawBros.KungFu%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4acf6546a73fd04459fb21a65c9ff8f45b5714b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,207,101,70,167,63,208,68,89,251,33,166,92,159,248,244,91,87,20,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
