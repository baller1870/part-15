This book presents a modern history of brunch not only as a meal, but also as a cultural experience. Relying on diverse sources, from historic cookbooks to Twitter and television, Brunch: A History is a global and social history of the meal including brunch in the United States, Western Europe, South Asia and the Middle-East. Brunch takes us on a tour of a modern meal around the world.\n\nWhile brunch has become a modern meal of leisure, its history is far from restful; this meal's past is both lively and fraught with tension. Here, Farha Ternikar explores the gendered and class-based conflicts around this meal, and provides readers with an enlightening glimpse into the dining rooms, verandas, and kitchens where brunches were prepared, served, and enjoyed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3464f5cbd9511406528718f587d33ee59fc7d65d","amp;dn":"Brunch%3A+A+History","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3464f5cbd9511406528718f587d33ee59fc7d65d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,100,245,203,217,81,20,6,82,135,24,245,135,211,62,229,159,199,214,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
