If it's just the big hits you're looking for, and as a matter of convenience it's easier to acquire this title, it does have the main familiar hits, from &quot;Where Were You When I Needed You&quot; and &quot;Let's Live for Today&quot; to &quot;Temptation Eyes&quot; and &quot;Sooner or Later.&quot; Those wishing for more obscure, worthy early cuts like &quot;Mr. Jones (Ballad of a Thin Man),&quot; &quot;Tip of My Tongue,&quot; and &quot;Feelings&quot; need to go to Rhino's two-CD Anthology.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff331368ab6b0c9fe31e31ee1d2cc75e6fb1180b","amp;dn":"20th+Century+Masters%3A+The+Best+of+the+Grass+Roots","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff331368ab6b0c9fe31e31ee1d2cc75e6fb1180b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,51,19,104,171,107,12,159,227,30,49,238,29,44,199,94,111,177,24,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
