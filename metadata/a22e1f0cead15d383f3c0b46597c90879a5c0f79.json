V. Meshchersky.\n\n    The present edition embraces all basic principles of theoretical\n    mechanics usually taught during the first two years of studies in\n    higher and secondary technical schools. The material in this book is presented consistently, i, e., proceeding from the particular to the general. The same method is applied to the order of paragraphs and the arrangement of the text.\n\n   \n\n    The primary objective of the book was to present to the reader\n    problems of practical value by giving the examples in such fields as the operation of machines and mechanisms, hydrodynamics, resistance of materials, and other branches of science and engineering. All this has made the book widely popular among the Soviet students of technical schools.\n\nThe book was translated from the Russian by N. M. Sinelnikova and edited by A. I. Lurie and the supplementary material: Solutions of Some Typical Problems is written by V. I. Kuznetsov. The book is an abridged version of the 28th edition of the book by Meshchersky published in 1962. This book was published by Higher School Publishing House in the 1968 (as per worldcat record, no date in the book). Dover also published this book in 1965.\n\nPDF | OCR | Bookmarked | Paginated | Cover | 21.9 MB | 307 pp | 600 dpi\n\n\nReleased on TPB by mirtitles.org\n\n===================================\nContents\n\nPreface 7\nPart I.
