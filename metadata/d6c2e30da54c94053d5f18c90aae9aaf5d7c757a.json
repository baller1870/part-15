Franco's mundane everyday life is interrupted when a female soldier approaches him, claiming his estranged father was killed by a suicide bomber at a train station. He and the young woman begin searching for clues to see if Franco's father, whom the soldier was romantically involved with, is dead or alive.\n\nThe book has received praise from comic book artist Joe Sacco, author of Palestine, who called it &quot;a profound, richly textured, humane, and unsentimental look at societal malaise and human relationships and that uneasy place where they sometimes intersect&quot;. Writing in The New York Times, Douglas Wolk compared her style to that of HergÃƒÂ©'s Tintin books, &quot;her charactersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ body language and facial expressions, rendered in the gestural Ã¢â‚¬Å“clear lineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ style of HergÃƒÂ©Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Tintin books, are so precisely observed, they practically tell the story by themselves&quot;.\n\nTime magazine's Lev Grossman named it one of the Top 10 Graphic Novels of 2007, ranking it at #8. It also won the 2008 Eisner Award for Best New Graphic Novel.\n\nRutu Modan was born in Tel Hashomer, Israel, in 1966. Her father was Prof. Baruch Modan, a cancer researcher who served as director general of the Israeli Health Ministry in the 1980s. Her mother was Prof. Michaela Modan, an epidemiologist specializing in diabetes research. Her sister is Dana Modan, an actress and writer. The family moved to Afeka in north Tel Aviv when she was ten.\n\nAfter graduating with distinction from the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem, she edited the Hebrew edition of MAD magazine with Yirmi Pinkus. Together they founded the Actus Tragicus comics group in 1995.[1] Modan received the Young Artist of the Year award in 1997 and the Best Illustrated Children's Book award from the Youth Department of the Israel Museum in 1998. In 2005, she was chosen as an outstanding artist of the Israel Cultural Excellence Foundation.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6c2e30da54c94053d5f18c90aae9aaf5d7c757a","amp;dn":"Exit+Wounds+%28GN%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6c2e30da54c94053d5f18c90aae9aaf5d7c757a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,194,227,13,165,76,148,5,61,95,24,201,10,174,154,175,93,124,117,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
