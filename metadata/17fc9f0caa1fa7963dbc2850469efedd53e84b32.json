A formidable boogie and blues pianist with a lovable growl of a voice, his most enduring achievements have fused New Orleans R&amp;B, rock, and Mardi Gras craziness to come up with his own brand of &quot;voodoo&quot; music. He's also quite accomplished and enjoyable when sticking to purely traditional forms of blues and R&amp;B. On record, he veers between the two approaches, making for an inconsistent and frequently frustrating legacy that often makes the listener feel as if the &quot;Night Tripper&quot; (as he's nicknamed himself) has been underachieving. ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:wifwxqe5ldhe~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:wifwxqe5ldhe~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAMG Album Review:\n\nOver his 35 years of recording, Mac &quot;Dr. John&quot; Rebennack has worn many hats, from '50s greasy rock &amp; roller to psychedelic '70s weirdo to keeper of the New Orleans music flame. All of these modes, plus more, are excellently served up on this two-disc anthology. From the early New Orleans sides featuring Rebennack's blistering guitar work (&quot;Storm Warning&quot; and &quot;Morgus the Magnificent&quot;) to the fabled '70s sides as the Night Tripper to his present-day status as repository of the Crescent City's noble musical tradition, this is the one you want to have for the collection.\n\nTrack List:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.
