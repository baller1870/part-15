But now, following a divorce and a strained relationship with his college-bound son (Travis Caldwell), Clay takes a surprising new gig as a music teacher at a local disadvantaged high school to pay the bills. Despite a new friendship with the janitor, Manny (Michael Beach), Clay faces the wrath of strict principal April Sutton (Josie Davis) and struggles to teach his underprivileged students who would rather listen to BeyoncÃƒÂ© than Basie. His effort seems hopeless until he discovers quiet skateboarder T.J. Harris (Chris Sheffield) riffing on the trumpet after school. Stunned by his talent, Clay enlists him to be the star of the schoolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new pep band, hoping to show the school board what the music program is made of at an upcoming concert, and help the failing school stay open.\n\nClay begins mentoring T.J. in music and in life, forcing himself to face the mistakes he made with his own son. As he slowly begins to reprise his part as dad and direct the band in harmony, T.J.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s rebellious reluctance and broken home life threaten to bring ClayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopes to a screeching stop. Will ClayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attempt at Notes From Dad fall flat or will he finally hit the right notes?\n\nCast: \n\nEddie Cibrian  ...  Clay Allen  \n\nJosie Davis  ...
