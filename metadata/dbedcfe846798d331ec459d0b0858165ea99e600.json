Eventually, After Re-Mortgaging His House And Setting Up His Own Label To Release White Ladder, The Manchester-Born Singer Would Prove That Perseverance And Unwavering Faith Are The Stuff Of One Million Album Sales. Unfortunately For Hut Records (Home Of The Verve, Gomez And Placebo) Their Supplies Of Both Ran Dry In 1995 After Gray's Second Album, Flesh, Bombed. Having Missed Out On The Main Prize Of White Ladder, Hut Here Capitalise On Gray's Success With This Collection Of His First Four Singles And Respective B-Sides. There Is, However, More To This Than Just Exploiting Fans. While Not As Instantly Compelling As White Ladder's Highlights, Nor As Heart-Wrenching As His Other Rarities Selection Lost Songs, There Are Some Beautiful Moments Amongst The 10 Acoustic Laments. His Pretend Accent (Part-Scottish, Part-Welsh, All Totally Unconvincing) Aside, &quot;Birds Without Wings&quot; Is Gorgeous, &quot;L's Song&quot; Is Tender And &quot;Brick Walls&quot; Is Classic Singer-Songwriter Material. For Completists, It's A Must For The B-Sides. For Fans Of Breakthrough Singles &quot;Babylon&quot; And &quot;Please Forgive Me&quot;, It's A Less Attractive Proposition As, Apart From &quot;The Rice&quot; And &quot;Wisdom&quot;, Some Of His Melodies Are So Subtle They're Almost Not There. But Like Everything With Gray, Perseverance Is Rewarded, Eventually.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Birds Without Wings\n[02] L's Song\n[03] The Light\n[04] Shine\n[05] Brick Walls\n[06] The Rice\n[07] Wisdom\n[08] Lovers\n[09] 4 A.M.\n[10] Coming Down\n \n\n\nMusic Videos \n\n[01] Shine \t[91.6mb]\n[02] Wisdom\t[93.7mb]\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:42m:14s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 289mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers, Music Videos &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes 8.2.0.23 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- Quicktime\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop Rock\n\nOriginally Released\t- 10 July 2001\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Hut Recordings Virgin Records\n\nArtist Website\t\t- http://www.davidgray.com \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://www.bebo.com/DavidGray \n\t\t\t- http://www.ilike.com/artist/David+Gray \n\t\t\t-\n\n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbedcfe846798d331ec459d0b0858165ea99e600","amp;dn":"%5B2001%5D+The+EPs+92-94+-+David+Gray+-+289mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbedcfe846798d331ec459d0b0858165ea99e600","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,237,207,232,70,121,141,51,30,196,89,208,176,133,129,101,234,153,230,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
