King's advice is grounded in his vivid memories from childhood through his emergence as a writer, from his struggling early career to his widely reported near-fatal accident in 1999 -- and how the inextricable link between writing and living spurred his recovery. Brilliantly structured, friendly and inspiring, &quot;On Writing&quot; will empower and entertain everyone who reads it -- fans, writers, and anyone who loves a great story well told.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fbce6edf6fa29310b8b420883a08549ec8eea70","amp;dn":"On+Writing+-+Stephen+King","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fbce6edf6fa29310b8b420883a08549ec8eea70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,188,230,237,246,250,41,49,11,139,66,8,131,160,133,73,236,142,234,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
