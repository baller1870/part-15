Shearing recorded solo piano sessions a number of times during his long career, though he rarely played unaccompanied for a vocalist, with the exception of his meetings with Mel TormÃƒÂ©. McRae also had a prolific career and is still in great voice interpreting this standard-heavy collection. Shearing's inventive chord substitutions in &quot;Too Late Now&quot; are a treat, with the singer making a delayed entrance. Shearing is rollicking in &quot;Gentleman Friend&quot; (the album's only uptempo track), which also features McRae doing a bit of scatting. The lesser-known &quot;Cloudy Morning&quot; finds the pianist in a bit of an impressionist mood and also sharing the vocals, while McRae's powerful interpretation of &quot;More Than You Know&quot; is another gem.
