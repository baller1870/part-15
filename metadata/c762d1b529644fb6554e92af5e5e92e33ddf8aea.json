The album was softened up in its original 12-song American edition to jibe with the Dylan/Byrds folk-rock sound, as well as squeeze money from the Parlophone catalog. The 14-song U.K. edition--the version now available on compact disc--is a different, more dynamic, and ultimately more accomplished achievement. So many classics: &quot;Drive My Car&quot; and &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; (both omitted from the U.S. edition) merge the early combustible Beatifics to a burgeoning studio consciousness; &quot;The Word&quot; can be read as a pre-psych warning shot; the sitar-laden &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; and the evocative &quot;Girl&quot; (the latter written on the last night of the sessions) stand as turning\npoints in John Lennon's oeuvre. George finally emerges too, with the McGuinn-ish &quot;If I Needed Someone.&quot; --Don Harrison\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Drive my car                                         [02:29]\n02.Norwegian wood (this bird has flown)                 [02:05]\n03.You won't see me                                     [03:20]\n04.Nowhere man                                          [02:44]\n05.Think for yourself                                   [02:19]\n06.The word                                             [02:43]\n07.Michelle                                             [02:42]\n08.What goes on                                         [02:49]\n09.Girl                                                 [02:32]\n10.I'm looking through you                              [02:26]\n11.In my life                                           [02:26]\n12.Wait                                                 [02:15]\n13.If I needed someone                                  [02:22]\n14.Run for your life                                    [02:21]\n____\n\n35:33 min\n 54,5 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
