The wave of privatization, instituted by Paul Bremer and reinforced by the International Monetary Fund, will not easily be reversed since the new government needs an impossible to reach majority to undo Bremer&amp;#039;s laws and enact the wishes of the Iraqi people. The IMF, the US government, the Paris Club and other international organizations are making a cruel joke of the promise of self determination in Iraq.\nNaomi Klein writes an internationally syndicated column for The Nation, The Guardian and The Globe and Mail.
