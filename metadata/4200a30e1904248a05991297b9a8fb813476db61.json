Journey toward warmer Mediterranean climes along the luxurious Cote d'Azur and pause beside the Colosseum in Rome. Travel north along the Danube, stopping in Vienna, then off to Prague and its extraordinary castle. Charming Dublin, rich in literary history, awaits you before making your way back to Italy.
