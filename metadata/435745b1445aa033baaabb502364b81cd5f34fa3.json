After breaking off with singer Cliff Richard (they were his backing band), the Shadows chalked up numerous instrumental hits in the early '60s, including &quot;Apache,&quot; &quot;Man of Mystery,&quot; and &quot;Kon-Tiki.&quot; They became the British equivalent of the Ventures. While the first disc is more than satisfying, the second disc takes a quick nosedive and consists mainly of filler along the lines of &quot;Don't Cry for Me Argentina,&quot; &quot;Theme from The Deer Hunter,&quot; &quot;Nights in White Satin,&quot; and &quot;Rodrigo's Guitar Concerto de Aranjuez.&quot; With the exception of Shadows fanatics, 50 Golden Greats would have been a much better value cut in half. By the way, the artwork for this set is absolutely hideous, especially coming from a huge corporation like EMI. ~ Al Campbell\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nDisc: 1 \n\n1. Apache \n2. Man of Mystery \n3.
