The first novel Coalescent (2003) is set in the present day, with the hero George Poole uncovering a human 'hive' in the catacombs of Rome. Exultant (2004) is set 25,000 years in the future, when humanity is locked in a galactic war. Transcendent (2005) follows up both the previous books, as George Poole's nephew Michael deals with climate-change disasters in the near future, amid an intervention from a far future beyond the Galaxy war. Resplendent (2006) is a 'fix-up' of short fiction (up to novella length) set against the background of this future history.\n\n\n01 - Coalescent\n\nWhen his father dies suddenly, George Poole stumbles onto a family secret: He has a twin sister he never knew existed, who was raised by an enigmatic cult called the Order.\n\nThe Order is a hive - a human hive with a dominant queen--that has prospered below the streets of Rome for almost two millennia.\n\nAfter Poole enters the Order's vast underground city and meets the disturbing inhabitants, he uncovers evidence that they have embarked on a divergent evolutionary path.\n\nThese genetically superior humans are equipped with the tools necessary to render modern Homo sapiens as extinct as the Neanderthals. And now they are preparing to leave their underground realm.\n\n\n02 - Exultant\n\nWhen it comes to cutting-edge science fiction, Stephen Baxter is in a league of his own. His mastery of hard science, his fearlessly speculative imagination, and his ability to combine grand philosophical questions with tales of rousing adventure make him essential reading for anyone concerned with the future of humankind. Now, in Exultant, Baxter takes us to a distant future of dazzling promise and deadly threat, in which a far-flung humanity battles for survival against an implacable alien foe.\n\nDestinyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Children\nEXULTANT\n\nFor more than twenty thousand years, humans have been at war with the alien race of Xeelee. It is a war fought with armaments so advanced as to be godlike, a war in which time itself has become an ever-shifting battleground. At the cost of billions of lives, and with ruthless and relentless efficiency, the ruling Coalition has pushed the Xeelee back to the galactic core, where the supermassive black hole known as Chandra serves the Xeelee as both fortress and power source.\n\nThere, along a front millions of light-years long, a grisly stalemate reigns,\nuntil a young pilot, Pirius, faced with certain death, disobeys orders and employs an innovative time-travel maneuver that, for the first time in the history of the war, results in the capture of a Xeelee fighter. But far from being hailed as a hero when he returns to base with his prize, Pirius is court-martialed, disgraced, and sentenced to penal servitude on a bleak asteroid.\n\nIt is not only Pirius who pays the price. In flying into the future and back again, Pirius returned to a time before heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d left, a time inhabited by his younger self. And that younger self, by the pitiless logic of Coalition justice, shares the older Pirius guilt and must be punished. Not everyone in the Coalition agrees. Commissary Nilis believes that the elder Pirius, whom he dubs Pirius Blue, may have found a way to defeat the Xeelee. But Nilis can do nothing for Pirius Blue. Instead, he takes charge of the younger Pirius (Pirius Red), and brings him back to Earth, the capital of a vast empire seething with intrigue.\n\nThere Pirius Red will discover truths that will shatter his preconceived notions of all that he is fighting for, even of what it means to be human. Pirius Blue, meanwhile, will learn truths harsher and more discomfiting still. Yet the most shocking revelation of all is still to come, waiting for them at a place called Chandra. . . .\n\n03 - Transcendent\n\nThe award-winning author of Exultantis back with the final volume in his monumental Destiny's Children trilogy, a tour de force in which parallel stories unfold-and then meet as humanity stands poised on the brink of divine providence . . . or extinction.\n\nFormat: M4A\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged\nCassette Rip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f06544d7d9fa7466a6319ae42d508bfc39ed2dae","amp;dn":"Stephen+Baxter+-+Destiny%27s+Children+%5B1-3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f06544d7d9fa7466a6319ae42d508bfc39ed2dae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,101,68,215,217,250,116,102,166,49,154,228,45,80,139,252,57,237,45,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
