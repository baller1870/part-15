Arguing that class struggle manifests itself as the conflict between the reproduction and survival of the human race, the general theme of the collected essays leans left and warns of market exploitation, war, and ecological disaster. Spanning nearly six decades and compiling essays that have appeared in anthologies or are selections from Selma James' booksÃ¢â‚¬â€some printed here for the first timeÃ¢â‚¬â€these selections preach equality in wages for men and women alike, especially in nontraditional work environments.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35d3ae527c0c6288c236c1c202e3e02b2dc6d059","amp;dn":"Sex%2C+Race+and+Class+-+The+Perspective+of+Winning","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35d3ae527c0c6288c236c1c202e3e02b2dc6d059","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,211,174,82,124,12,98,136,194,54,193,194,2,227,224,43,45,198,208,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
