The term &quot;fallen angel&quot; does not appear in the Bible, but it is used of angels who sinned (such as those referred to in 2 Peter 2:4, &quot;For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment ...&quot;), of angels cast down to the earth in the War in Heaven, of Satan,[1] demons,[2] or of certain Watchers.[3] The term has become popular in fictional literature regarding angels.\n\nMention of angels who descended to Mount Hermon (not &quot;fell&quot; to Earth) is found in the Book of Enoch, which the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church accept as canonical, as well as in various pseudepigrapha.\n\nSons of God\nMain article: Sons of God\n\nIn the period immediately preceding the composition of the New Testament, some sects of Judaism identified the &quot;sons of God&quot; (Ã—â€˜Ã—Â Ã—â„¢ Ã—â€Ã—ï¿½Ã—Å“Ã—â€Ã—â„¢Ã—ï¿½) of Genesis 6:1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ4 with fallen angels.[4] Some scholars consider it most likely that this Jewish tradition of fallen angels predates, even in written form, the composition of Gen 6:1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ4.[5][6] Lester L. Grabbe calls the story of the sexual intercourse of angels with women &quot;an old myth in Judaism&quot;.[7] Indeed, until the mid-2nd century AD, Jewish writing (such as midrashim) can be taken to identify the &quot;sons of God&quot; of Gen 6:1 and 4 as angels.[8] By the 3rd century, there is evidence that some early Christians accepted this Jewish Enochic pseudepigraphy and the application of the angelic descent myth to the &quot;sons of God&quot; passage in Genesis 6:1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ4.[9] Its presence not only in the East but also in the Latin-speaking West is attested by the polemic of Augustine of Hippo (354Ã¢â‚¬â€œ430) against the motif of giants born of the union between fallen angels and human women.[10] Rabbinic Judaism and Christian authorities rejected the tradition.[11] Those who adopted the tradition viewed the &quot;sons of God&quot; as fallen angels who married human women and by unnatural union begot the Nephilim.[12]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bb607c4e737c26571960187beef9c565a8aa9ca","amp;dn":"Hidden+Secrets+-+Part+55+-+Fallen+Angels","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bb607c4e737c26571960187beef9c565a8aa9ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,182,7,196,231,55,194,101,113,150,1,135,190,239,156,86,90,138,169,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
