This is one film that is really made with intelligence. From conversation, strategy, film direction, and music. The war is so smartly planned out. And the best of all is that it is base on a true Chinese historical event with real characters back to life again. \n\nI can say this is one of the best movies I have watched in my life. Having this movie breaking up into two parts is a great move!!! This first part of the movie ended nicely. I am so glad they didn&amp;#039;t try to put everything in to just one film\n\nGo watch it, you will be laughing, clapping, wowing, touched, and heart pumping! It is a fully entertaining and intelligent film and super cool ! Definitely Oscar worthy !!!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&quot;Error (2) The torrent file seems to be broken.
