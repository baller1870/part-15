Set in a believable future, you take on the role of an elite operative handpicked to join Project IM, a top secret military program being assembled to protect mankind from all dangers outside our solar system.\r\n\r\nInterstellar Marines is inspired by movies such as Aliens, Starship Troopers and Final Fantasy; and games such as Half-Life, System Shock 2, and Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield. Interstellar Marines is all about evolving the FPS recipe with all the inspirations we've assimilated since the birth of the genre. Our goal is an evolutionary leap forward driven by our compulsive interest in science fiction, role-playing, military realism, and respect for first person immersion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f03fcc6fe43ebbc14ae2e8bb246c219142324334","amp;dn":"Interstellar+Marines+-+Spearhead+Edition+%28Update+24%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f03fcc6fe43ebbc14ae2e8bb246c219142324334","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,63,204,111,228,62,187,193,74,226,232,187,36,108,33,145,66,50,67,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
