Once burned, the CD autoruns as the Gobliiins 4 installer but the right-click menu in Computer or Browsing to the &quot;Classics&quot; folder you can install the old games from the WinRAR SFX archive, complete with icon sets, scanned manuals, and Start Menu entries. The SFX installs to %ProgramFiles% so if you have a 64-bit system you'll have to move them and update your shortcuts accordingly.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n~grenole/osmosis","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55292dc468c3373d9ca908fad8f187e91538c0b6","amp;dn":"Gobliiins+Bundle+%28Gobliiins%2C+Gobliins+2+-+The+Prince+Buffoon%2C+Go","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55292dc468c3373d9ca908fad8f187e91538c0b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,41,45,196,104,195,55,61,156,169,8,250,216,241,135,233,21,56,192,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
