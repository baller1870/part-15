The band has consisted of a large and fluid collective of musicians focused around its creative centre, frontman Kurt Wagner. Initially indebted to traditional country, the music has subsequently moved through a range of influences including post-rock, soul and lounge music. (wikipedia)\n\nMr. M was recorded at Nevers's Nashville Beech House studio cum bungalow, working with the usual core of musicians- Scott Martin (drums), Matt Swanson (bass), Ryan Norris (guitar, organ), Tony Crow (piano), William Tyler (guitar). Guests include original co-founder Jonathan Marx, delightful Cortney Tidwell and fiddler Billy Contreras - and with spectacular string arrangements shared between Peter Stopschinski and Mason Neely, it stretches out sonically as promised. (cityslang.com)\n\n'This is a record of, and about, love and the healing, binding force that it represents. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the thing that becomes, more and more, the only thing worth living for as we move on through these years together, not alone', says Wagner.\n\n- - -\n\nLambchop - Mr. M  2012\n(City Slang)\n\n 1.
