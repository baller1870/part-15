But six years ago, Ed made a bad career move and ended up unemployed. He and Bettina lost everything they had worked for. They began to drink and quickly became alcoholics. Ed has been hospitalized for internal bleeding and Bettina for withdrawals so excruciating she thought she was dying. Their children have begged them to stop drinking, but it only strengthens the bond between Ed and Bettina.\nFrom Wikipedia.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:566e92e866247539aaf9e642e559e2a72bf03c27","amp;dn":"Intervention+S04E22+-+Ed+and+Bettina.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"566e92e866247539aaf9e642e559e2a72bf03c27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,110,146,232,102,36,117,57,170,249,230,66,229,89,226,167,43,240,60,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
