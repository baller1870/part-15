A diagram in which each story is represented by a letter of the alphabet explicates the intertwining of the nine tales. As the producer explains each actor's role, the film begins. The stories, rooted in folklore, bump up against each other as the film leaps back in forth in time. They involve a jewel stolen from a painting, a mirror that &quot;steals&quot; what it reflects, a seminary student who dresses as a priest to hear the nuns' confessions, brothers who combat each other in their search for a group of rings, a man whose everyday life is predicted by a website 24 hours in advance, a Catholic who finds out he's really Jewish, and a treasure map that leads to a pirate's chest. Each of the main cast members plays multiple roles. Ruiz veterans Melvil Poupaud and Elsa Zylberstein play the lead roles, while Lambert Wilson, Christian Vadim, Diogo DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ria, JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Meireles, and RogÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rio Samora play supporting roles. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Combat d'amour en songe.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.61 GiB\n      Duration : 2h 1mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 896 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 2h 1mn\n      Bit rate : 1 630 Kbps\n      Width : 688 pixels\n      Height : 416 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.654\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.228\n      Stream size : 1.39 GiB (86%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 2h 1mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 256 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Video delay : 16ms\n      Stream size : 223 MiB (14%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0252335/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0252335/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFrench, Portuguese and Spanish audio; English, French and Portuguese subtitles (idx/sub)\n\nPosted at KG by duder, whom we thank\n\nRaoul Ruiz - Combat d'amour en songe (2000)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7697694c7a641b74e9bc2d79490539814a7eafee","amp;dn":"Raoul+Ruiz+-+Combat+d%5C%27amour+en+songe+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7697694c7a641b74e9bc2d79490539814a7eafee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,151,105,76,122,100,27,116,233,188,45,121,73,5,57,129,74,126,175,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
