The song is cleverly disguised as a Ã¢â‚¬ËœletÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s partyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ tune, but acts as a platform to get some things off JonathanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mind. The central theme becomes a call towards a more friendly country. He lets us know rather quickly that he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like the turn popular culture is taking. Jonathan doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t particularly care for the grunge rock, give him a great party tune like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hang on SloopyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ any day. He addresses the collective American laziness through MTV, Ã¢â‚¬ËœTheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d rather watch T.V. than watch a real person singÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. This song introduces I, Jonathan as a story of self-discovery. But to change himself isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t enough, Jonathan would like to help us all out.\n\nOur first stop introduces us to a case of social isolation, which is addressed in Ã¢â‚¬Å“You CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Talk to the DudeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, an appeal to a female friend in a dead end relationship. He paints a picture of a woman stuck with an unromantic jerk, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœhe doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t taste his food, he just shovels it downÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Sadly, the song is too short. Jonathan knows he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t change our minds with such a direct approach to the situation. He is trying to make a point with all of this, but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not sure what quite yet.\n\nSo, Jonathan goes directly for the big guns in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Velvet UndergroundÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. If he is to change the world, why not enlighten us by bringing up some of musicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest heroes? He tells us of this perfect band, idolizing them at every turn, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœhow in the world did they make that sound?Ã¢â‚¬â„¢. He offers multiple examples for the VelvetsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ greatness, playing up their underdog greatness at every possible turn, celebrating their Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtwangy sounds of the cheapest typeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, and even taking a brief break to give us a taste of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sister RayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I Was Dancing in the Lesbian BarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sees Jonathan growing frustrated with the gloomy mainstream. Here he realizes that the problem isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ours, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s his. He is making the decision to hang out with stereotypes and scenesters; their phoniness is a part of the package. Fed up with this, he moves downtown to the industrial district where he can finally shake it. From the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœdrinking in sipsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to Ã¢â‚¬Ëœshaking their hipsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, he traces the evolution of his active rejection of a culture that is bad for him.\n\nIn Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rooming House on Venice BeachÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Jonathan follows through with what he speaks of. Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe ancient world was in my reachÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ he explains. Everything is so close. He still speaks in the popular tongue though, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœit was rough with that ancient rustic hippie stuffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, he says. By the end of the song, the Ã¢â‚¬ËœwasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in the refrain becomes more evident, a thematically perfect lead-in to an unexpected masterpiece.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“That Summer FeelingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, arguably RichmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most beautiful song, brings us right to the edge of JonathanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s discovery. He has been searching for some untouchable feeling, but we find out that he has had this all along. He addresses multiple, equally heartbreaking feelings; the grade school awkwardness, the high school crushes, Ã¢â‚¬ËœYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll throw everything away for itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. The albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s centerpiece, it is also the most difficult track. He continually pounds us with these sentimental memories, and then nears to a close... and then picks it right up again.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A Higher PowerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is Jonathan finding what he was looking for. He sings of a brand new love ecstatically, Ã¢â‚¬ËœItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s magic, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s magic, the way we got togetherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ he exclaims proudly. Ã¢â‚¬ËœI know that magic is an easy word to condemnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, he says simply, defeating all cynicism that there was before. He looks past the grimness of everyday life to a brighter horizon. Ã¢â‚¬ËœThere must be a higher power somewhereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ he says, knowing that it is completely true.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Twilight in BostonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ takes us along to where Jonathan is. He takes us to this dreamy place in his mind. His excitement is so uncontainable, and the words roll out of him effortlessly, as if he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even care if anybody else is listening. The phrases appear with the most romance possible; Ã¢â‚¬ËœWhen itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s twilight in Boston...Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ a slight pause follows, Jonathan taking a moment to consider the perfect phrase, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtime for adventureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. We end our journey with things looking up, whatever happens, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll make it.\n\nThe music on the album is thoroughly gorgeous and unobtrusive to JonathanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quest. JonathanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice is, as usual, wonderfully expressive, yet remarkably naÃƒÂ¯ve. The album is incredibly powerful, working this wonderful magic in just under forty minutes. You should most definitely pick up a copy.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92effd35db4f312c44c01aacbef87b7a2c2aa97a","amp;dn":"Jonathan+Richman+-+1992+-+I%2C+Jonathan+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92effd35db4f312c44c01aacbef87b7a2c2aa97a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,239,253,53,219,79,49,44,68,192,26,172,190,248,123,122,44,42,169,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
