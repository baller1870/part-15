The original band comprised initiator and main songwriter Chrissie Hynde (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), James Honeyman-Scott (lead guitar, backing vocals, keyboards), Pete Farndon (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Martin Chambers (drums, backing vocals, percussion). Following the drug-related deaths of Honeyman-Scott and Farndon, the band has experienced numerous subsequent personnel changes, with Hynde as the only consistent member, and Chambers returning after an absence of several years.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLast of the Independents is the sixth album by rock group The Pretenders, released in 1994. For this album, the band is officially credited as being Chrissie Hynde (vocals, guitar), Adam Seymour (guitar), Andy Hobson (bass) and Martin Chambers (drums). However, this line-up only plays together on one track (&quot;All My Dreams&quot;); the rest of the album is performed by Hynde and Seymour in conjunction with a rotating series of musicians on bass and drums. These musicians include Hobson and Chambers, as well as bassists Andy Rourke, Tom Kelly and David Paton, and drummers Jimmy Copley and J.F.T. Hood. A few other session musicians also appear, including Ian Stanley, and one-time Pretenders guitarist Robbie McIntosh, who plays alongside Hynde and Seymour on &quot;I'm a Mother&quot;.\n\nThe album also marked the official return of Chambers, who had been fired by Hynde eight years prior.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonnel:\n\n\nChrissie Hynde: guitar (1-3,5-12), vocals\nAdam Seymour: guitar (1-13)\nAndy Hobson: bass guitar (1,6,13)\nMartin Chambers: drums (3,4,6,12)\n\n\nAdditional Personnel:\n\n\nRobbie McIntosh: guitar (8)\nAndy Rourke: bass guitar (2,3,5,9-12)\nIan Stanley: organ (5), special effects (2), keyboards (8)\nJ.F.T.
