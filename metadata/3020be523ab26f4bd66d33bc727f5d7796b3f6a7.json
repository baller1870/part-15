Brannon \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“She is magnetic to me. Every emotion she feels pulls me that much closer to her charm and energy. For reasons unbeknownst to me, I want her to know what she means to me.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ~Jake Evans \n\nFor Jake Evans, life was as it should be. No responsibilities. He was the master at embracing his reckless lifestyle whenever it presented itself. Surviving on his ability to expertly hustle, fight and womanize, Jake could do it all; lived it all. \n\nRaised in a rundown city, filled with crime and drugs, he had survived the death of an abusive mother and a life with an absent father while only having his brothers to depend on. His lifestyle became fast and Jake had lived it the only way he knew how, until the day he met Delilah. \n\nDelilah St. James was the epitome of flawless. Brought up in an affluent southern household, DelilahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life had been planned from the moment she was born. She was raised to be the perfect socialite and daughter, and groomed to be the ideal wife. When a school internship moved her to Sulfur Heights for the summer, Delilah collided with the bitter reality of life outside her comfortable gated community when Jake Evans upset her perfect world.\n\nOver the next two years, Jake and Delilah became best friends, embracing a friendship neither one was prepared to have, although they soon found it to be a relationship that neither one of them were willing to sacrifice. \n\nA tragic turn of events brings Jake and Delilah together once again. Only this time, the feelings are different. Lines within their friendship are blurred. Everything they vowed never to do, becomes the very thing they cannot deny. Will Jake and DelilahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relationship withstand the changes surrounding them? Or will the emotions sever the two year friendship theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d fought so hard to keep?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3020be523ab26f4bd66d33bc727f5d7796b3f6a7","amp;dn":"Blind+Love+%28Sulfur+Heights+%233%29+by+M.S+Brannon+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3020be523ab26f4bd66d33bc727f5d7796b3f6a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,32,190,82,58,178,111,75,214,109,51,188,114,127,93,119,150,179,246,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
