The band is often credited (along with D.R.I.) as one of &quot;the fathers of crossover thrash&quot;. To date, Suicidal Tendencies have released nine studio albums, one EP, four split albums including the rare Welcome to Venice, six compilation albums (one of which is a &quot;double-EP&quot;, while the other is a re-recording of their debut album), and two long-form videos.\r\n\r\nSuicidal Tendencies rose to fame with their 1983 self-titled debut album, which spawned the single &quot;Institutionalized&quot;, and was one of the first hardcore punk videos to receive substantial airplay on MTV. Suicidal Tendencies' next release was on their own label, Suicidal Records, where they contributed one song, &quot;Look Up...(The Boys Are Back)&quot;, on the 1985 split Welcome to Venice. \r\n\r\nAfter releasing their second album Join the Army (1987), Suicidal Tendencies were signed to Epic Records in 1988, and continued their success with their next three albums, How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can't Even Smile Today (1988), Controlled by Hatred/Feel Like Shit...DÃ©jÃ  Vu (1989) and Lights...Camera...Revolution! (1990); the latter of the two were certified Gold by the RIAA. Their 1992 follow-up album The Art of Rebellion was also very successful, and included two of their biggest hits &quot;Nobody Hears&quot; and &quot;I'll Hate You Better&quot;.\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n\r\nAll tracks mp3 320ak\r\n\r\n01 Suicide's an Alternative-You'll Be Sorry.mp3\r\n02 Two-Sided Politics.mp3\r\n03 Subliminal.mp3\r\n04 I Shot the Devil.mp3\r\n05 Won't Fall in Love Today.mp3\r\n06 Institutionalized.mp3\r\n07 War Inside My Head.mp3\r\n08 Don't Give Me Your Nothin' [#].mp3\r\n09 Memories of Tomorrow.mp3\r\n10 Possessed.mp3\r\n11 I Saw Your Mommy.mp3\r\n12 Fascist Pig.mp3\r\n13 A Little Each Day.mp3\r\n14 I Want More.mp3\r\n15 Suicidal Failure.mp3\r\n\r\n\r\nDeluxe Edition Tracks\r\n\r\n16 You Can't Bring Me Down.mp3\r\n17 Suicidal Maniac.mp3\r\n18 No More No Less.mp3\r\n19 Give It Revolution.mp3\r\n20 Send Me Your Money.mp3\r\n21 Go'n Breakdown.mp3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent members\r\n\r\n    Mike &quot;Cyco Miko&quot; Muir â€“ lead vocals (1981â€“present)\r\n    Dean Pleasants â€“ lead guitar (1996â€“present)\r\n    Nico Santora â€“ rhythm guitar (2012â€“present)\r\n    Ra DÃ­az â€“ bass (2016â€“present)\r\n\r\nTouring Members\r\n\r\n    Dave Lombardo â€“ drums (2016â€“present)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:084ced0abb2bfba3389c3227c1dea09483429bab","amp;dn":"Suicidal+Tendecies+-+Still+Cyco+2016+%28Deluxe+Edition%29320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"084ced0abb2bfba3389c3227c1dea09483429bab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,76,237,10,187,43,251,163,56,156,50,39,193,222,160,148,131,66,155,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
