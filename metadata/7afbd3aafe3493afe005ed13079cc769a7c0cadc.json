Emergent Design points the way. \nAs software continues to evolve and mature, software development processes become more complicated, relying on a variety of methodologies and \napproaches. This book illuminates the path to building the next generation of software. Author Scott L. Bain integrates the best of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most important \ndevelopment disciplines into a unified, streamlined, realistic, and fully actionable approach to developing software. Drawing on patterns, refactoring, and\n test-driven development, Bain offers a blueprint for moving efficiently through the entire software lifecycle, smoothly managing change, and consistently \ndelivering systems that are robust, reliable, and cost-effective.\n\nPLZ SEED AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7afbd3aafe3493afe005ed13079cc769a7c0cadc","amp;dn":"Emergent+Design-+The+Evolutionary+Nature+of+Professional+Softwar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7afbd3aafe3493afe005ed13079cc769a7c0cadc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,251,211,170,254,52,147,175,224,5,237,19,7,156,199,105,167,192,202,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
