Reflecting the superficiality of societal notions of beauty through the alienness of landscape and the ephemeral riddle of true identity through epic, soul-searching journeys and faceless phantoms that emerge from thin air before vanishing from view, the terrifying images break apart and eventually disintegrate into irresolvable fragments of haunted memory within the course of the increasingly abstract film, as the waking dream descends ever further into the realm of nightmare and the deepest recesses of the subconscious, unraveling the veil of human vanity to reveal amorphous shadows cast by empty souls.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1a25e667d74838ccd1f7e80987c02396c91e833","amp;dn":"La+Femme+qui+se+poudre+AKA+The+Woman+Who+Powders+Herself+%28Patric","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1a25e667d74838ccd1f7e80987c02396c91e833","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,162,94,102,125,116,131,140,205,31,126,128,152,124,2,57,108,145,232,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
