OK...don&amp;#039;t\nmither me.\n   I had this mate once...long time ago\n...his name was Ziggy.   He was some sort\nof Polish merchant seaman or whatever.\nHe lived with this blonde bird.   And one \nnight...(oh, should mention they lived in a\ntower block)...she opened the bedroom window\nand leapt.   She made a right mess on the \npavement.   Talk about Heart of Darkness,\nit&amp;#039;s not in it.   And this happened in \nManchester, UK.   It was not even in the\nBelgian Congo.   Joseph Conrad...eat your\nheart out.   \n   And I had this other mate whose name\nwas John.   Some bloke that John knew \nasked to borrow an axe from him.   Then\nthe bloke went home with the axe that\nJohn had lent him and buried it in his \nwife&amp;#039;s skull.   \n   Another mate...he was called John\naswell.   When it used to be the old\ncoin meters for the gas over here.   He\nborrowed five pence for the gas meter and\nthen stuck his head in the gas cooker oven.\nTopped himself.   \n   What I am trying to say is...I still\nlove Sigourney Weaver.   \n   And I had this other mate, about thirty-\nfive, thirty-six years ago.   He went\nbonkers.   Caved his mam&amp;#039;s skull in with a\nFender Telecaster.   That&amp;#039;s no way to treat\na guitar.   He said the voices\nfrom the television had told him to\ndo it...what do you expect if you watch \nthe BBC.   He&amp;#039;s still in the secure mental \nfacility.   He will never be allowed out.\n   Oh yeah.   Hi, guys.   Forgot to say\nhello.   Sorry.\n   And do you know that a male&amp;#039;s ejaculum\nexits from the penis at an average speed\nof about 28mph.   That&amp;#039;s faster than my\nbitch can gobble.   Just thought I&amp;#039;d\nmention it.    \n   And a great quote for you.   When a\njournalist asked Rita Hayworth why her\npersonal life had been such a series of\ntragedy, she replied: &quot;It&amp;#039;s not my fault.\nMen went to bed with Gilda, but woke up\nwith Rita Hayworth&quot;.   Is that a great\nquote or what.   She was a lovely\nlooking woman.   I might dig her up.\n   Nightissuchproximity bursts into\nsong: &quot;Gimme the moonlight...gimme the \nspade...and leave the rest...to...me&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb4693309ac1df84832ccd41ec9c05190c715356","amp;dn":"Nigel+Kennedy+-+Polish+Spirit+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb4693309ac1df84832ccd41ec9c05190c715356","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,70,147,48,154,193,223,132,131,44,205,65,236,156,5,25,12,113,83,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
