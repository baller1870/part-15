But, he could never bring himself to commit suicide. His attempts to die always fail miserably until he finds the perfect solution: A quirky assassination agency that helps kill suicidal people. KIL agrees with the terms of the company. The assassination will be anonymous. He wouldn't know the details about who the assassin is, even when or where he will die. This was ideal for KIL, until he falls for a girl he meets, Zara. Suddenly, he starts to have second thoughts on taking his life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:406b8b90752720a99ee44247c31fbafc5537d02e","amp;dn":"KIL+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"406b8b90752720a99ee44247c31fbafc5537d02e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,107,139,144,117,39,32,169,158,228,66,71,195,31,186,252,85,55,208,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
