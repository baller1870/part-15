A strong acoustic Delta blues flavor colors much of the material, particularly &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; and &quot;No Expectations,&quot; which features some beautiful slide guitar work. Basic rock &amp; roll was not forgotten, however: &quot;Street Fighting Man,&quot; a reflection of the political turbulence of 1968, was one of their most innovative singles, and &quot;Sympathy for the Devil,&quot; with its fire-dancing guitar licks, leering Jagger vocals, African rhythms, and explicitly satanic lyrics, was an image-defining epic. On &quot;Stray Cat Blues,&quot; Jagger and crew began to explore the kind of decadent sexual sleaze that they would take to the point of self-parody by the mid-'70s. At the time, though, the approach was still fresh, and the lyrical bite of most of the material ensured Beggars Banquet's place as one of the top blues-based rock records of all time. \n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\nSympathy for the Devil - 6:18\nNo Expectations - 3:56\nDear Doctor - 3:21\nParachute Woman - 2:20\nJigsaw Puzzle - 6:05\nStreet Fighting Man - 3:15\nProdigal Son (Robert Wilkins) - 2:51\nStray Cat Blues - 4:37\nFactory Girl - 2:08\nSalt of the Earth - 4:47","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9df33de7ab7ed6fa7ece2072a1b8991c25b8e749","amp;dn":"The+Rolling+Stones+-+Beggars+Banquet+%5BFLAC%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9df33de7ab7ed6fa7ece2072a1b8991c25b8e749","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,243,61,231,171,126,214,250,126,206,32,114,161,184,153,28,37,184,231,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
