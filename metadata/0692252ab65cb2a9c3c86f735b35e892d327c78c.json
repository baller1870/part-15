Notables included Joseph De Camp, who claimed that Whistler never mastered chiaroscuro; impressionist William Paxton; Edmund Tarbell, chronicler of leisure-class pursuits and New England scenery; Frederic Vinton, who went to Madrid to copy oils by Velasquez; and Frank Benson, known for his plein air landscapes. All but forgotten today, the Boston School artists deserve a better fate, argues Gammell, himself a painter of allegories as well as an erstwhile friend and colleague of these artists.
