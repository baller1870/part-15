Strangely, I (again) didn't see a collected torrent for last this past week's Marvel NOW! titles, so I thought I'd upload one. Included are:\n\nAmazing X-Men 001 (you know what they say about comic book deaths)\nCaptain America 013\nCaptain Marvel 017\nDaredevil - Dark Nights 006 (of 8) (it's Palmiotti. Read it on principle)\nIron Man 018\nLongshot Saves the Marvel Universe 001 (of 4) &lt;-- looking forward to this, myself! Huzzah, Longshot!\nMighty Avengers 003\nX-Men Legacy 019\n\nIf you like them and have the money, buy them and support your favorite writers, artists, local comic shops and publishers. Thanks be to all you uploaders and scanners and seeders out there! Enjoy, and please do seed :]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cf7e7c69ccca82116f816637aaee8deb4f2ecb7","amp;dn":"Marvel+NOW%21+Week+51+11%2F06%2F2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cf7e7c69ccca82116f816637aaee8deb4f2ecb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,247,231,198,156,204,168,33,22,248,22,99,122,174,232,222,180,242,236,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
