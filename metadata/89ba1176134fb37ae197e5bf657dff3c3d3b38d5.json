The arrangements are busier than on his previous recordings, but they never get in the way of his off-the-cuff style. His vocals are perhaps more eccentric here than usual, delivering out of the ordinary versions of If I Were a Carpenter and Tennessee Stud. The difference between Elliott's versions and those of your average folksinger is that he sounds as though he's having a good time. This renders over-familiar material, like the above-mentioned songs, fresh. There are great versions of Danville Girl and Don't Think Twice, It's Alright, and a nice original titled, 912 Greens. Elliott usually stuck to singing other people's songs and held onto his folk roots even when singer-songwriters began to take over the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60s folk scene. Even the Rolling Stone's Connection, comes across as country-folk, not rock-and-roll. Elliott also includes a couple of Woody Guthrie songs to let everyone know where his roots lay. Richie Unterberger's liner notes do a great job of placing this album in context. It would be the first of two albums Elliott would record for Reprise in an unsuccessful attempt to bring him to a larger audience. Larger audience or not, the music stands for itself. Young Brigham is a nice snapshot of Elliott in the late Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60s and shows him leaving the confines of a large studio with his folk heritage intact.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89ba1176134fb37ae197e5bf657dff3c3d3b38d5","amp;dn":"Ramblin%27+Jack+Elliott+-+Young+Brigham+%281968%29+MP3%40256","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89ba1176134fb37ae197e5bf657dff3c3d3b38d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,186,17,118,19,79,179,122,225,151,229,191,101,125,255,60,61,59,56,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
