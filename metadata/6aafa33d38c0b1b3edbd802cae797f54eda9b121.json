As you prepare to create your schema, you must consider a number of factors. This guide explains each of those factors in detail and recommends an approach for documenting your schema development plan in an information model.\nYour information model can not only be used as a planning mechanism to develop your schema but can also be used as a training resource and as a reference guide for those using the schema after it is developed. By putting a well thought out information model in place, you are bound to produce a schema that you can use indefinitely and build upon easily.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6aafa33d38c0b1b3edbd802cae797f54eda9b121","amp;dn":"Beyond+Schemas+-+Planning+Your+XML+Model","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6aafa33d38c0b1b3edbd802cae797f54eda9b121","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,175,163,61,56,192,177,179,237,189,128,44,174,121,127,84,237,169,177,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
