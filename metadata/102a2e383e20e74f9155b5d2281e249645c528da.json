Confronting the failure of both standard classical and neoclassical theory to fill the gap between monetary and non-monetary economics, he posits an idea of competitive markets that can be linked to the monetary sector, and explains the way in which economic theory has been adjusted to reflect developments in the real economy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:102a2e383e20e74f9155b5d2281e249645c528da","amp;dn":"A+Market+Theory+of+Money","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"102a2e383e20e74f9155b5d2281e249645c528da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,42,46,56,62,32,231,79,145,85,181,210,40,30,36,150,69,197,40,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
