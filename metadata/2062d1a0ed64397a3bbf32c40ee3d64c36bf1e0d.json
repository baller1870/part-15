His family refuses to move because they fear that the move will jeopardize their financial well-being. Nakajima burns down his foundry to force them to go to Brazil but, instead, they go to the courts and have him declared mentally incompetent. After several more increasingly irrational acts, he is finally placed in a mental asylum, where he sits staring at the sun, believing that he is on another planet and the sun is the raging inferno created by the Earth when it went up in the nuclear holocaust--vindicating his actions. A strong indictment against the inherent evils of nuclear warfare, it is also the story of a man&amp;#039;s love and dedication to his family in the face of his own fears and endangerment.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : I Live In Fear - 1955 - Akira Kurosawa.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 43mn\n      Bit rate : 1881 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 12.5 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Custom\n      PlayTime : 1h 43mn\n      Bit rate : 1789 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.242\n      StreamSize : 1.29 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 43mn\n      Bit rate : 83 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 61.6 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.97 \n      Encoding settings : ABR\n\nIMDB: tt0048198\n\nJapanese audio, English subtitle\n\nCriterion Collection rip.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2062d1a0ed64397a3bbf32c40ee3d64c36bf1e0d","amp;dn":"Ikimono+no+kiroku+-+I+Live+In+Fear+-+1955+-+Akira+Kurosawa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2062d1a0ed64397a3bbf32c40ee3d64c36bf1e0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,98,209,160,237,100,57,122,59,191,50,196,14,227,214,76,54,191,30,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
