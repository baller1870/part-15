It is by Nanette Workman and Frampton plays guitar on this CD apparently as a &quot;studio musician&quot;.  He does not do any vocals, it is all Nanette Workman.  The cover&quot; art leads you to believe it is a Frampton album: a bit deceiving.  There are still some decent tracks worth listening to for classic rock fans.  You be the judge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:917b1d2dd604fb4b391cadac89dce63efa2b2440","amp;dn":"Peter+Frampton+And+Friends+-+Pacific+Freight+%5B2003%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"917b1d2dd604fb4b391cadac89dce63efa2b2440","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,123,29,45,214,4,251,75,57,28,173,172,137,220,230,62,250,43,36,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
