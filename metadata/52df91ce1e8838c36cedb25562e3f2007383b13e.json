Mainstay members are Brian Nichol on lead vocals and guitar, Stephen &quot;Fess&quot; Parker on lead guitar and Geoff Turner on bass guitar. In 1987 they were joined by Mark Lucas on drums. Their most popular albums are Feel the Heat (March 1980) and Scream of the Real (May 1983), which both peaked in the top 25 of the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart. Their best known songs are &quot;Coming Home&quot;, &quot;No Tragedy&quot; and &quot;Gimme Head&quot;. Rock music historian, Ian McFarlane described the group as &quot;an archetypal, hard-working pub-rock band capable of delivering tightly crafted, well-executed, hard-hitting metal-pop anthems backed by a playful sense of humour. The band toured constantly, racking up over 2500 gigs by the early 1990s&quot;.\n\n 1 Summer Holiday   \n 2 All Of Your Love    \n 3 Reason    \n 4 Comin' Home   \n 5 Numbers  \n 6 17 (I Wish I Was)\n 7 Nancy Can't Dance    \n 8 Hit and Run    \n 9 It's Easy   \n 10 Radiation  \n 11 Fess' Song    \n 12 Gimme Head \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52df91ce1e8838c36cedb25562e3f2007383b13e","amp;dn":"The+Radiators+-+In+Their+Element","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52df91ce1e8838c36cedb25562e3f2007383b13e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,223,145,206,30,136,56,195,108,237,178,85,98,227,242,0,115,131,177,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
