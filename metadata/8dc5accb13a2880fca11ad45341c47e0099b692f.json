So this new version includes that and a couple of short videos where they try to explain what's going on.\n\nMy connection's pretty slow, so remember to keep seeding for others when you're done!\n\nIf you don't already have an FLV player installed on your computer, the K-lite Mega Codec Pack is an option. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.free-codecs.com/k_lite_Mega_codec_pack_download.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.free-codecs.com/k_lite_Mega_codec_pack_download.htm&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dc5accb13a2880fca11ad45341c47e0099b692f","amp;dn":"Team+Four+Star+-+DBZ+Abridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dc5accb13a2880fca11ad45341c47e0099b692f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,197,172,203,19,162,136,15,202,17,173,69,52,28,71,224,9,155,105,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
