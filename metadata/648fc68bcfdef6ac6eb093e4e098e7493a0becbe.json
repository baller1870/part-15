This particular set was purchased at the American electronics store, Best Buy (thus the Cow Palace bonus disc). However, the Wings Over the World documentary on disc 4 IS NOT FROM AN ACTUAL DVD FROM THE BOX SET. Since I haven't been able to find an upload of the bonus DVD to share, I have instead place a TV rip of a BBC airing of the documentary. You will notice a little BBC mark in the top left corner of the screen. I assure you that this special is frame for frame exactly what you would find on the box set DVD. I'll piss off now, enjoy the material. \n\n\n*** ALL TRACKS 320KBPS/16 BIT MP3 ***\n\n*** ALL TAGS (ARTIST, YEAR, NAME, ALBUM, ETC.) EMBEDDED\n\n*** iTUNES READY.
