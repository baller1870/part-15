The bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut Temporary Resident was lauded by Daytrotter, Huffington Post and Filter Magazine calling the record a Ã¢â‚¬Å“solid showcase of the duoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocal compatibility, soulful piano and lyrical strength.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ To support the release, the band played at SXSW with further tour dates confirmed throughout the summer.\n\n  Imaginary Cities was born in a Winnipeg club as a happenstance collaboration of singer Marti Sarbit and Matyas in between sets. Matyas, a major label veteran via his band The Waking Eyes and a touring member of Canadian indie rockers The Weakerthans, knew he wanted to write something forÃ¢â‚¬â€or withÃ¢â‚¬â€Sarbit. The result came in the form of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Say You,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the lead track from Temporary Resident, thus propelling the duo to the top of Canadian college charts and year end best-of lists.  The band toured extensively throughout 2011-2012, opening for acts like Ra Ra Riot and the Pixies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b9b179a0bbcef8788aa748107997ac238c242c1","amp;dn":"Imaginary+Cities+-+Fall+of+Romance+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D+PERFECT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b9b179a0bbcef8788aa748107997ac238c242c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,155,23,154,11,188,239,135,136,170,116,129,7,153,122,194,56,194,66,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
