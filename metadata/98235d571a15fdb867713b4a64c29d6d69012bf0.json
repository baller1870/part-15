It is a frightening experience, indeed, to discover how much of his satirical prediction of a distant future became reality in so short a time.\n\nBiography\n\nAldous Huxley (1894-1963) is the author of the classic novels Brave New World, Eyeless in Gaza, and The Genius and the Goddess, as well as such critically acclaimed nonfiction works as The Devils of Loudun, The Perennial Philosophy, and The Doors of Perception. Born in Surrey, England, and educated at Oxford, he died in Los Angeles, California.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98235d571a15fdb867713b4a64c29d6d69012bf0","amp;dn":"Brave+New+World+-+Aldous+Huxley+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98235d571a15fdb867713b4a64c29d6d69012bf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,35,93,87,26,21,253,184,103,113,59,74,100,194,157,109,105,1,43,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
