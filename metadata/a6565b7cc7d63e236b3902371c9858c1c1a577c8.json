I set it 240:P I didn't go lower.\n 2.4 set audio: mp3, audio bitrate 56kbs, sample rate 22050Hz\n\n3. Hit the button:D\nYou should get videos somewhere around 60-90 mb.\n\nThat's all\n(of course, then you create a torrent, then upload to tpb:D)\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6565b7cc7d63e236b3902371c9858c1c1a577c8","amp;dn":"TTC+VIDEO+Understanding+the+Brain+%28compressed+1.6Gb%29+public","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6565b7cc7d63e236b3902371c9858c1c1a577c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,86,91,124,199,214,62,35,107,57,2,55,28,152,88,193,193,165,119,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
