The theory and circuit descriptions are geared towards genuine design applications rather than the oversimiplifications and skeleton circuits of many college texts.\nDuring his career, the late Joe Carr was one of the world's leading writers on electronics and radio, and an authority on the design and use of RF systems. Whether you are looking for a complete self-study course in RF technology, or a concise reference text to dip into, this book has the solution.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddbecbefdc534b19a0f8e67cae2daf4d319467c6","amp;dn":"RF+Components+and+Circuits+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddbecbefdc534b19a0f8e67cae2daf4d319467c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,190,203,239,220,83,75,25,160,248,230,124,174,45,175,77,49,148,103,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
