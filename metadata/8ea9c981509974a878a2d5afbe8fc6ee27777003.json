A visiting archaeologist called Varun Shrivastav comes to the village of Manikpur in West Bengal to excavate the temple grounds of the local Zamindar. With knowledge and experience beyond his young demeanour, Varun greatly impresses the Zamindar and his family. Especially Pakhi, the Zamindar's feisty and only daughter, who finds herself irrevocably drawn towards him. But Varun isn't all he seems on the surface. And as the simmering attraction between him and Pakhi leads to a tender and deep love, he is forced to choose between her and his past. Making his choice, Varun disappears. Pakhi struggles to move on with her life, determined to forget him and their relationship. Until one day, when he returns under the most extraordinary circumstances. Inspired from O. Henry's &quot;The Last Leaf&quot;, Lootera is the uplifting story of two lovers. Of heartbreak, betrayal... and ultimate redemption.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/Vv3lpXy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/Vv3lpXy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/WF7EqtK&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/WF7EqtK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/ncreN1I&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/ncreN1I&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/a4T7WOS&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/a4T7WOS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/iI3xvrb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/iI3xvrb&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/F9jsFhW&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/F9jsFhW&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/VAx8COd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/VAx8COd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/gGLgAvd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/gGLgAvd&lt;/a&gt;\n\nwe are on FaceBook, Post Your Request, suggestion, and find upcomming Release of Silver RG, you will find all Silver RG Encoders at FB Page so keep in touch\n\n\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, All SilverTorrentHD Encoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers - Contact Us @\n\n:Support:\nTook 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 24 Hours to Upload &amp; Seed\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 10 Seconds to say &quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ea9c981509974a878a2d5afbe8fc6ee27777003","amp;dn":"Lootera+%282013%29+Hindi+DvDRip+720p+x264+5.1+MaNuDiL+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ea9c981509974a878a2d5afbe8fc6ee27777003","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,169,201,129,80,153,116,168,120,162,213,175,190,143,198,238,39,119,112,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
