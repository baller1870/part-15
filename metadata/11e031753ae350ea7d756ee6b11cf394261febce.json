Tongue That Cannot Lie  \n\n\n\nKarine didn't have a tricky second album. &quot;Scribbled in Chalk&quot; managed to eclipse the impact of her debut solo album &quot;Faultlines&quot;, and &quot;Fairest Floor&quot; followed that with equal aplomb, so surely &quot;This Earthly Spell&quot; will finally be a passing work, a mediocrity, proof that no artist can be that consistent. No. Not a bit. Here are 10 songs that would shame any first album with its treasure trove of long saved songs, that both hold together in their totality and yet offer everything from political vitriol to maternal love. A number of songs have had airings on You-Tube as rough recordings but now shine all the brighter for the airy backing vocals of Inge Thomson or the clever rhythms of messers Foulds &amp; McGuire and the ever creative and tasty, tasty perfect simplicity of brother Steven. \n\nThis is real, visceral, potent, charming, intimate and profoundly beautiful song writing delivered by an Artist and band of genuine talent and ability which will push every emotional and cerebral button and leave you oddly comforted in it's very existence. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/10/16/karine-polwart/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/10/16/karine-polwart/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11e031753ae350ea7d756ee6b11cf394261febce","amp;dn":"Karine+Polwart...This+Earthly+Spell%282008%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11e031753ae350ea7d756ee6b11cf394261febce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,224,49,117,58,227,80,234,125,117,110,230,177,28,243,148,38,31,235,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
