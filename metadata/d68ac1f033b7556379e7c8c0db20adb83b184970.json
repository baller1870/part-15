Court Artist. And for thirty years, I draw murderers. Thirty years. I've seen too many bastards cowards. The only light in this hell, that was my daughter Caroline, so sweet, so fragile. Caroline was raped one night in a suburban train. Caroline who committed suicide three months later. Now she is dead. I can sink into depression that attracts me so long. My life was Caroline and murderers: Caroline is gone, I have the killers. The portraits of those I have drawn are pinned in my office. Those bastards who ruined my life seem to challenge me, waiting for me. To finish once and for all, I have only one solution: I'll kill them, one after the other, to their release. I will avenge Caroline. Avenge my life.\r\n\r\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d68ac1f033b7556379e7c8c0db20adb83b184970","amp;dn":"The+Sketch+Artist+v1+v2+%282008%29+%28Sosich%29+cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d68ac1f033b7556379e7c8c0db20adb83b184970","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,138,193,240,51,183,85,99,121,231,200,192,219,32,173,184,59,24,73,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
