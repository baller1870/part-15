This is an album that demands your attention.\n\nIt is an intimate and personal story; with new dimensions to be discovered each time you listen. The nine carefully selected tracks showcase a deeper and more mature sound.\n\nFor instance, with its suggestive forceful baseline, deep emotive rhythms and nuanced underlying melodies Berlin Soundtrack breaks new ground within the progressive landscape.\n\nNothing short of perfection and already a festival hit Kiss the Ground resonates a melancholic melody that cuts through your soul in perfect balance with deep energetic bass grooves.\n\nWith its rhythmic offbeat baseline and mind-blowing symphonies the track Say Goodbye embodies Querox trademark sound and is sure to be another dance floor filler.\n\nAmong other gems, the album also features Querox remix of Phaxe's Fly Away and the track Backstage Girls featuring Monod.\n\nIf there is one album you are going to buy this summer, this is the one.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11a142159857539c886ef81d624b4a25a8f7c758","amp;dn":"Querox+-+How+Life+Goes+On+2012+%5Bprogressive+trance%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11a142159857539c886ef81d624b4a25a8f7c758","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,161,66,21,152,87,83,156,136,110,248,29,98,75,74,37,168,247,199,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
