Days later, with many bodies still unidentifiable, Karen resigns herself to the awful truth: her husband of eighteen years is dead.\n\n  On that same day, a suspicious hit-and-run accident leaves a young man dead in Karen's hometown of Greenwich, Connecticut. Ty Hauck, a detective, becomes emotionally caught up in the case and finds a clue that shockingly connects the two seemingly unrelated events.\n\n  Months later, two men show up at Karen's home digging into Charles's business dealings. Hundreds of millions of dollars are missingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and the trail points squarely to Charles. With doubt suddenly cast on everything she has ever known, Karen, with Hauck, steps into a widening storm of hedge fund losses, international scams, and murder. And as the investigations converge, these two strangers touched by tragedy are pulled into a deepening relationship and unwittingly open the door to a twistedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and deadlyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½conspiracy.\n\n  With its breakneck pacing, plentiful twists, compelling characters, and abundant heart, The Dark Tide confirms Andrew Gross's place as a master storyteller at the top of his game.\n\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\n  Gross, who's partnered with James Patterson on a number of bestsellers (Lifeguard, etc.), mixes murder, suspense, sex and romance as capably as his mentor in his assured second solo thriller (after The Blue Zone). Charles Friedman, a New York hedge fund trader, perishes in a bombing at Grand Central Station that destroys the railroad car in which he was riding one morning from his home in Greenwich, Conn. Ty Hauck, head of the Greenwich police's violent crime unit, enters the picture when a hit-and-run victim turns out to have a vague connection to Friedman. Soon, Friedman's widow and her kids are threatened by men searching for vast sums of money her late husband never earned. The stakes rise as Hauck's involvement shifts from professional to personal. While the reader will occasionally see the next drop, tunnel or curve looming far ahead, the roller-coaster thrills are still there in abundance.\n\nFrom Booklist\n  The second solo novel from frequent James Patterson cowriter Gross is much better than his first. This one begins with a bang, as a bomb explodes in a commuter train station, killing several people, including New York City hedge-fund manager Charles Friedman. At roughly the same time, a suspicious auto accident kills a young man in Greenwich, Connecticut. The detective on that case, Ty Hauck, soon discovers an odd connection between the hit-and-run and the bombing. He investigates and discovers that Charles Friedman was not the man he appeared to be. He also forges a connection with the dead manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wife, Karen, that leads him into uncharted waters. This is a tightly written corporate-style thriller very much in the mold of Joseph Finder, with a likable protagonist and a story that combines traditional thriller elements with a more gentle, emotional subplot. --David Pitt\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e3cdb5e4a66d533f2a123135267ae84a635d3cf","amp;dn":"THE+DARK+TIDE+-+Andrew+Gross.+Read+by+Melissa+Leo+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e3cdb5e4a66d533f2a123135267ae84a635d3cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,60,219,94,74,102,213,51,242,161,35,19,82,103,174,132,166,53,211,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
