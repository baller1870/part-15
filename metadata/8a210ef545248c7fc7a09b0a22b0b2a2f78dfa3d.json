They use honey, agave syrup and fruit, but there's more to replacing sugar than just adding sweetness. For one baker, going sugar-free isn't enough as they take the healthy option one step further and bake a cake without any traditional forms of flour.\n\nPaul picks the technical challenge, gluten-free pittas, which are made with a very sticky dough that tests the bakers' skill - but which of them can get the desired pocket within their pittas?\n\nFor their show-stopper, the bakers must make dairy-free ice cream rolls. Mary and Paul are looking for silky-smooth ice cream, surrounded by jam and a light sponge. Coconut milk provides the base for all the ice cream, tropical flavours are in abundance, and there's more than one desert island for the judges to try - and even a fondant sunbather","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a210ef545248c7fc7a09b0a22b0b2a2f78dfa3d","amp;dn":"The.Great.British.Bake.Off-S06E05-Alternative.Ingredients-360p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a210ef545248c7fc7a09b0a22b0b2a2f78dfa3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,33,14,245,69,36,140,127,199,160,155,10,34,176,178,162,247,141,250,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
