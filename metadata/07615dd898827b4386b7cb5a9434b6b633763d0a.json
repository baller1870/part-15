These are the best-ever live recordings of the Blues-Rock-Funk master\n\nTed Horowitz (born March 31, 1960 in the Bronx, New York City), who plays under the stage name of Popa Chubby (a play on the slang idiom &quot;pop a chubby&quot;, meaning to get an erection), is an American electric blues singer, song writer, and guitarist.\nBorn the son of a candy store owner, at age thirteen Horowitz began playing drums; shortly thereafter, he began listening to the music of the Rolling Stones and started playing guitar. Although he grew up in the 1970s, Horowitz was influenced by artists of the 1960s, including Jimi Hendrix and Cream, among others. In his early twenties, although he mainly played blues music, he also worked as backing for punk rock poet Richard Hell. Horowitz first came to public attention after winning a national blues talent search sponsored by KLON, a public radio station in Long Beach, California. He won the New Artist of the Year award and as a result was chosen as the opening act at the Long Beach Blues Festival in 1992.\nHorowitz played more than 200 club dates a year through the 1990s.\n\n\nDisc 1\n1.
