This means the quality is not brilliant, but this is more than made up for by the quality of the documentary.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e127e8205148d03cdbc2ee27f7f25942a7f5e61c","amp;dn":"How+the+West+Was+Lost++%28Complete+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e127e8205148d03cdbc2ee27f7f25942a7f5e61c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,39,232,32,81,72,208,60,219,194,238,39,247,242,89,66,167,245,230,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
