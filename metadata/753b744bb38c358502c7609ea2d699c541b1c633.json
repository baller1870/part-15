It follows rapidly in the footsteps of the bands previous albums &amp;#039;Youth And Young Manhood&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Aha Shake Heartbreak&amp;#039; &amp; &amp;#039;Because Of The Times&amp;#039;, which have quickly established them as one of the most prolific and acclaimed acts around. \n\nDespite a wave of criticism asserting that Kings of Leon&amp;#039;s fourth full-length is &quot;too commercial,&quot; Only by the Night may be the closest thing to a pitch-perfect album to drop in 2008. Granted, Tennessee&amp;#039;s band of brothers (and one first cousin) takes a turn for the heavily polished here, but what the album lacks in rough-edged raunch, it more than makes up for in earnestness and--yes--stunning beauty. From the opening notes of &quot;Closer&quot; to the listing balladry of &quot;Cold Desert,&quot; Only by the Night hardly misses a beat. Highlights abound, particularly in the trading off of melodic lines between instruments, and in this regard, bassist Jared Followill is the album&amp;#039;s quiet MVP. Above these gorgeous instrumentals, singer Caleb emotes with a dramatic grit that never loses its command. A model of melodic rock composition, arranged and produced with a warm, inviting veneer, and performed with aching sincerity, these 11 tracks coalesce into a sanguine whole that eclipses the band&amp;#039;s much-discussed rock posturing and yields more with every play. A good band&amp;#039;s great album, Only by the Night (finally) establishes Kings of Leon as a rock act that worthy of seriously sustained attention.\n\n\nCome and check out a great literature/arts/creative works forum at \nwww.raikothan.com - lots of good people, a good time and usually plenty of \nmadness :)\n\nCheck outfor the home of this releaser and lots of even \nbetter ones - also they have cookies! :)\n\nEnjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:753b744bb38c358502c7609ea2d699c541b1c633","amp;dn":"Kings+Of+Leon+-+Only+By+The+Night+%5B2CD+-+Bonus+Live+CD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"753b744bb38c358502c7609ea2d699c541b1c633","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,59,116,75,179,140,53,133,2,199,96,158,162,214,153,197,65,177,198,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
