From his beginnings working with Benny Goodman, through his work with George Shearing, Quincy Jones, on soundtracks and his own recordings and recordings with other Jazz greats, Toots has shown the world that the harmonica isn't simply the humble musical instrument used by hobos and shoeshine boys. \nThis collection gives an excellent overview of Toots' amazing career.  The earliest recording, from 1953, features Toots with George Shearing and from there it takes us through his many musical faces, from his many recordings with Quincy Jones, through various small groups and orchestras that he has recorded with included his many forays into Latin American Jazz. \n\nThe overal result is a complex, yet satisfying collection that will surely delight any Toots Thielemans fan as well as give a wonderful introduction to the uninitiated.  If you thought that the harmonica was simply a novelty in the world of Jazz, then this album will certainly give you a great taste of what the harmonica is capable of. \n\nI definitely recommend that you add this masterpiece to your collection.  ~ peter krampert\n\nIf you like music, you will love this compilation of classics from this Belgian genius.  Toots simply oozes class in this compendium - even if you don't like jazz, you will be converted after listening to such tunes as Flirt and the fantastic Hummin' ~ Neil Francis Ardiff\n\nVerve Jazz Masters 59 - Toots Thielemans Tracks:\n01  Undecided 2:36 \n02  Body And Soul 2:36 \n03  Flirt 2:48 \n04  Soldier In The Rain 3:12 \n05  HumminÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ 8:10 \n06  Brown Ballad 4:24 \n07  YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re My Blues Machine 3:07 \n08  Bluesette 7:02 \n09  Big Bossa 4:03 \n10  Tenor Madness 8:08 \n11  Nocturne 3:07 \n12  Vai Passar 5:14 \n13  Killer 4:42 \n14  The Peacocks 6:34 \n15  C To G Jam Blues 2:59 \n16  For My Lady 4:31 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c84012bd64b38e36bb4f52b84d20428cc158d2b0","amp;dn":"Verve+Jazz+Masters+59+-+Toots+Thielemans+%281996%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+192%5D%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c84012bd64b38e36bb4f52b84d20428cc158d2b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,64,18,189,100,179,142,54,187,79,82,184,77,32,66,140,193,88,210,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
