This fan version contains; the 12 voice-over narrations, All the UNRATED 'graphic-violence' scenes &amp; the Director's ending cut. This version removes; The extended 'happy' ending and the unicorn daydream scene. Most of the footage (1 Hour 43 Minutes &amp; 27 Seconds) is taken from the restored &amp; remastered 'Final Cut' &amp; The rest of the footage (14 Minutes &amp; 26 Seconds) is taken from the International Cut. Directly from the Blu-rays.\n\n*Why? I've always loved the International theatrical version since it is UNRATED -- Unlike the US Theatrical cut. The Voice-over narration is another favourite of mine since it gives it that 'old fashioned detective movie feel' while still maintaining its Film Noir characteristics -- *Spoilers* Yet I disliked the extended 'happy' ending since it just interjected material from a completely different movie and felt out of place &amp; without sense. With the Director's Final Cut I loved the job they did with the restoration, and the abrupt ending is masterful since it leaves you thinking &amp; wondering, yet I disliked how instead of leaving Deckard's humanity in question it pretty much just destroyed all argument by adding the 'unicorn daydream scene' -- This is the main reason why this fan cut is a mix of both of those versions.\n\nSYNOPSIS: With a blend of science fiction and noir detective fiction, this dystopian film presents a vision of the future where man has developed the technology to create replicants -- human-like androids with short life spans built by the Tyrell Corporation &amp; used in dangerous off-world colonization. Deckard is a Blade Runner -- a euphemism for bounty-hunters that track down and assassinate rogue replicants -- He has been forced back into active duty to hunt down a quartet of replicants who have escaped from an off-world colony and headed to Earth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c11a5bed840d2973c1c9c9ab54055927e4a10f0","amp;dn":"Blade+Runner+%281982%29+1080p+5.1+Blu-ray+%5BFinal+Int%27l+Fan+Cut%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c11a5bed840d2973c1c9c9ab54055927e4a10f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,17,165,190,216,64,210,151,60,28,156,154,181,64,85,146,126,74,16,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
