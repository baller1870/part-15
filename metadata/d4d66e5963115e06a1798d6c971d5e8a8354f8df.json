Frankie And Albert\n\nThis single-disc selection from Yazoo is interesting because it bypasses some of Charley Patton's best-known sides like &quot;Down the Dirt Road Blues&quot; and &quot;High Sheriff Blues&quot; in favor of presenting a more versatile Patton capable of handling gospel and even pop fare (check out the take here of &quot;Some Summer Day&quot; to hear a relatively softer and gentler Charley Patton). Since Patton's rhythms and overall approach can be repetitive at times, a single disc like Primeval Blues, Rags and Gospel Songs that mixes things up a bit makes a perfect introduction for casual listeners, but Patton's recorded work is both the Big Bang and the epicenter of country-blues, so going a little deeper and springing for one of the several fine box sets available is well worth the time and expense. \n\nCharley Patton (vocals, guitar); Willie Brown (guitar); Bertha Lee (vocals); Henry &quot;Son&quot; Sims (fiddle).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4d66e5963115e06a1798d6c971d5e8a8354f8df","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Charlie+Patton+-+Primeval+Blues%2C+Rags%2C+And+Gospel+Songs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4d66e5963115e06a1798d6c971d5e8a8354f8df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,214,110,89,99,17,94,6,161,121,141,108,151,29,94,138,131,84,248,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
