Fiona is an upper-class woman, who cares for the lower class and tries to educate them, which isn't well received by her peers. Fiona gives Cole an education, despite his lack of proper manners and his initial lack of interest for literature and arts. \nOver time, Fiona starts coughing and finally falls ill. No rational doctor can help her and, in his desperation, Cole takes her to doctor Absinthe, a mad genius, who is shunned by everybody else for performing horrible experiments. Absinthe promises to save Fiona, but needs Cole to do something for him to save her. He reveals the Engine, a machine capable of traveling through time. He tells Cole to travel to the future and take back all books on science and any objects that he can find. Cole travels to the future and lands in London in 1954. He does as Absinthe asks him, but Absinthe betrays him and doesn't help Fiona, who succumbs to her disease. Cole feels like his heart is ripped out and decides to give Absinthe a little payback and buries the Engine beneath Stonehenge. Absinthe is furious that Cole has hidden the Engine. He rips out Cole's actual heart.\nThe first issue of Steampunk begins 100 years later: Cole wakes up in a strange coffin during the Victorian Age. Cole's memory is a mess, he can recall little of his past and when he looks at himself, he's in shock: his chest is now a metal furnace and his right arm is a gigantic mechanical claw. He is informed that London is now under the rule of Lord Absinthe and has been for the last century.\nCole becomes an unwilling inspiration to the Underground Resistance led by Sir Robert Peel, while Absinthe hears of Cole's return and sends his best assassins to capture him.\n\n\nThe series debuted in 2000 and ran for 12 issues. Originally planned for 24 issues, lack of readership ended the series at the end of act II. Joe Kelly's non-linear storytelling and Bachalo's highly detailed, though possibly confusing, penciling style received little interest from the mainstream comic-reading public. The series did have its supporters, especially Bachalo himself, saying, &quot;really enjoyed Steampunk. That was probably my favorite book that IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve worked on&quot;.  Despite the early cancellation, Bachalo still has a desire to finish the series.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4abd83531857cf1876967e9bd56e2075c77f84de","amp;dn":"Steampunk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4abd83531857cf1876967e9bd56e2075c77f84de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,189,131,83,24,87,207,24,118,150,126,155,213,110,32,117,199,127,132,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
