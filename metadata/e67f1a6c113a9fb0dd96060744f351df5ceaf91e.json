Shillcutt, Sibel Suzen \r\nFormat: PDF \r\nHardcover: 573 pages \r\nPublisher: CRC Press; 1 edition (October 15, 2014) \r\nLanguage: English \r\nISBN: 9781482220094 \r\n\r\n\r\nThere is growing interest in the field of melatonin research regarding its neurobiological mechanisms as well as its repercussions in clinical practice. Melatonin: Therapeutic Value and Neuroprotection explores melatoninâ€™s neuroprotective effects and discusses the therapeutic potential of melatonin and melatonin agonists in treating neurodegenerative diseases and other ailments. Topics include:\r\n\r\n- The basic aspects of melatoninâ€™s physiology, including its production, bioavailability, and metabolism\r\n- The functional importance of melatonin receptors and their role in mediating the therapeutic effectiveness of melatonin in cancer\r\n- Melatoninâ€™s effect on the regulation of blood pressure, sleep, and circadian rhythms\r\n- The cardioprotective role of melatonin\r\n- The neuroprotective role in glaucoma, Alzheimerâ€™s disease, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, and neurodegenerative diseases\r\n- Use as a therapeutic agent for treating epilepsy and degenerative discs\r\n- Treatment for obesity, diabetes mellitus, and other metabolic disorders\r\n- Protective role in peri-natal hypoxic-ischemia\r\n\r\nThe contributors also examine the discovery of a number of melatonergic agonists, their potential role as antioxidants, and their therapeutic applications in treating glaucoma, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, Alzheimerâ€™s disease, primary insomnia, and psychiatric disorders. Opening new vistas in our understanding of etiology, pharmacotherapy, and treatment, the book is a significant milestone in our knowledge about advances in melatoninâ€™s physiology and its therapeutic application in a number of disorders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e67f1a6c113a9fb0dd96060744f351df5ceaf91e","amp;dn":"Melatonin%3A+Therapeutic+Value+and+Neuroprotection+%5B2014%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e67f1a6c113a9fb0dd96060744f351df5ceaf91e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,127,26,108,17,58,159,176,221,150,6,7,68,243,81,223,92,234,249,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
