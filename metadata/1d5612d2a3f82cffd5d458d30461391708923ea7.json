Directed by the BAFTA-nominated Cy Endfield, whose credits include Zulu and Hell Drivers, Hide and Seek also stars Oscar winner Hugh Griffith, Bond villain Curd JÃƒÂ¼rgens and Golden Globe-winning British actress Janet Munro. \n\nWhilst working on a top-secret missile project, research scientist David Garret (Carmichael) runs into an old friend from behind the Iron Curtain - now a world chess champion working for mysterious businessman Hubert Marek. The hapless professor of astronomy is shortly to find himself at the centre of a kidnap plan designed to make it appear that he has in fact defected to the Soviet Union.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 737mb\nDuration.... 01:27:13\nCodec.......
