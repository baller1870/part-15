This is the sound of the south, where the lines between country and soul blurred beyond recognition, producing magnificent music. \r\n\r\nThere are no hits here â€“ indeed, some of this is even unearthed, including James Carr's &quot;Tell Me My Lying Eyes Are Wrong&quot; â€“ but that only illustrates how deep the country-soul river ran: it was a constant among a certain brand of soul singer, as this splendid collection makes plain. With any luck, there will be a Volume 3 on the horizon\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - The Sweet Inspirations - But You Know I Love You\r\n02 - William Bell - Please Help Me, I'm Falling\r\n03 - Clarence Carter - Bad News\r\n04 - Hank Ballard - Sunday Morning Comin' Down\r\n05 - The Facts Of Life - Sometimes\r\n06 - Pat Lundy - Only Mama That'll Walk The Line\r\n07 - Otis Redding - Tennessee Waltz\r\n08 - Bobby Hebb - A Satisfied Mind\r\n09 - Ralph Lamar - Don't Let Me Cross Over\r\n10 - Joe Simon - Help Me Make It Through The Night\r\n11 - Ted Taylor - I'll Release You\r\n12 - Millie Jackson - Sweet Music Man\r\n13 - James Carr - Tell Me My Lying Eyes Are Wrong\r\n14 - Bettye Swann - Don't You Ever Get Tired (Of Hurting Me)\r\n15 - Johnnie Taylor - Sixteen Tons\r\n16 - Bobby Bland - I Hate You\r\n17 - David Ruffin - Statue Of A Fool\r\n18 - Esther Phillips - Sweet Dreams\r\n19 - Eddie James - All I Have To Offer You (Is Me)\r\n20 - Etta James - When I Stop Dreaming\r\n21 - Isaac Hayes - I Can't Help It (If I'm Still In Love With You)\r\n22 - Dorothy Moore - Funny How Time Slips Away\r\n23 - Orquestra Was feat.
