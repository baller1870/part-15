This has a low rating from IMDB, but that is because most people are pathologically stupid.  It is a decent movie, strange of course, as anything from Kurt Vonnegut is guaranteed to be.\n\nIn any case, from the IMDB:\n\nA portrait of a fictional town in the mid west that is home to a group of idiosyncratic and slightly neurotic characters. Dwayne Hoover is a wealthy car dealer-ship owner that's on the brink of suicide and is losing touch with reality.

The film also features Nick Nolte as Harry LeSabre, Hoover's cross-dressing associate, and Barbara Hershey. Written by Malachi \n\n--------------------------\n\nBruce Willis' character is just too damned funny in this movie.  The video quality is ok, and audio is reasonably good (levels are good, sound is clear).\n\nIn any case, enjoy.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12f116f704f4954f5202ad3658b25b2725493cd9","amp;dn":"Breakfast+of+Champions+-+Bruce+Willis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12f116f704f4954f5202ad3658b25b2725493cd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,241,22,247,4,244,149,79,82,2,173,54,88,178,91,39,37,73,60,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
