Just hold down the Command key for a while - KeyCue comes to help and shows a table of all currently available keyboard shortcuts. When you have found the desired shortcut in the KeyCue table, just type it and continue working as usual. The KeyCue window will disappear automatically. You no longer need to memorize and remember key combinations, just press the command key and KeyCue tells you what you want to know. Over time, you will automatically remember frequently used shortcuts and become a power user of your favorite applications, working much more efficiently.\n\nWhat's New:\n\n* Check for Updates is now accessible via KeyCue's menu bar icon.\n\n* New internal drawing order avoids partially clipped submenu frames.'\n\n* Avoids beeps when dismissing the shortcut table with the Esc key.\n\n* Improved diagnostic messages when KeyCue detects applications \n  with incorrect menu structures.\n\n* Improves menu scanning of deeply nested bookmarks in Safari.\n\n* KeyCue now recognizes the &quot;fn fn&quot; shortcut for &quot;Start Dictation&quot; on \n  Mountain Lion.\n\n* Fixes a problem in FileMaker 12, where KeyCue missed some \n  shortcuts after switching between Layout and Browse modes.\n\n* Fixes a cosmetic issue where the desktop background was not shown\n   in the Theme tab of KeyCue's settings.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nPPC Mac or Intel Mac, OS X.5.8 or greater\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1f362d0bae1cb591bd433b6752d4851b749c4c7","amp;dn":"KeyCue+with+CORE+keygen+v.+6.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1f362d0bae1cb591bd433b6752d4851b749c4c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,243,98,208,186,225,203,89,27,212,51,182,117,45,72,81,183,73,196,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
