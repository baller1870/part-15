YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll start with the general principles and technologies behind this architectural approach, and then dive hands-on into three fully-functional API examples.\n\nToo many APIs rely on concepts rooted in desktop and local area network patterns that donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t scale wellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½costly solutions that are difficult to maintain over time. This book shows system architects and web developers how to design and implement human- and machine-readable web services that remain stable and flexible as they scale.\n\n    * Learn the H-Factors for representing application metadata across all media types and formats\n    * Understand the four basic design elements for authoring hypermedia types\n    * Convert a simple read-only XML-based media type into a successful API design\n    * Examine the challenges and advantages of designing a hypermedia type with JSON\n    * Use HTML5ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rich set of hypermedia controls in the API design process\n    * Learn the details of documenting, publishing, and registering media type designs and link-relation types \n\n\n\n# Paperback: 242 pages\n# Publisher: O'Reilly Media (December 1, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1449306578\n# ISBN-13: 978-1449306571\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5713e2dd085f25e3018a93195f4d4d4f41fbe878","amp;dn":"Building+Hypermedia+APIs+with+HTML5+and+Node+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5713e2dd085f25e3018a93195f4d4d4f41fbe878","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,19,226,221,8,95,37,227,1,138,147,25,95,77,77,79,65,251,232,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
