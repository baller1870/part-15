He sets forth a controversial, compelling thesis: the very qualities that mark those with mood disordersÃ¢â‚¬â€creativity, resilience, empathy, and realismÃ¢â‚¬â€also make for the best leaders in times of crisis. From the importance of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“depressive realismÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and creativity of mentally ill or mentally abnormal figures such as Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Martin Luther King, Jr., to the lackluster leadership of Ã¢â‚¬Å“mentally normalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ men such as Neville Chamberlain, George W. Bush, and Tony Blair, A First-Rate Madness overturns many of our most cherished perceptions about greatness and the mind and provides a unique insight for understanding our current political leaders and presidential candidates going into the next election season.\n  \nA First-Rate Madness includes profiles of Tony Blair, George W. Bush, Neville Chamberlain, Winston Churchill, Mahatma Gandhi, Adolf Hitler, Martin Luther King, Jr., Abraham Lincoln, Richard Nixon, Franklin D. Roosevelt, William Tecumseh Sherman, Ted Turner, among other famous leaders.
