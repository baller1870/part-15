While Krishna is busy with his endless pranks and mischiefs accompanied by his friends, Kamsa remains restless for he is aware that Krishna is his nemesis. As in the past, a prophecy had threatened Kamsa that his evil reign is over, and a savior will descend on earth to make Kamsa meet his worst adversity in life, which is his death. The only objective of Kamsa\\'s life therefore, was to find his angel of death.\n\nSworn to see the end of Krishna, Kamsa relentlessly sends his trusted aids, the ferocious demons to Vrindavan in order to kill Krishna. But Krishna is born to be a savior as he crushes the deadly demons one after another with heroic poise.*\n\n1. 01-06 Darling Of Vrindavan\n2. 01-06 Wondrous Feats\n3. 01-06 Legendary Warrior\n\nAdd to your playlist and enjoy!
