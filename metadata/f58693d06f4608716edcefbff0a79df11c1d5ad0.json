Managing the annual Bath Christmas MarketÃ¢â‚¬â€which involves long hours in the cold and a whole lot of hassleÃ¢â‚¬â€will secure the promotion he needs to afford to move out of his noisy, top-floor flat. Where not even his balcony is safe from an aggressive herring gull.\n\nThe last stallholder he expects to see is his ex. Riley never recovered from their break up, and five years on the old chemistry still sparkles. So does their habitual head butting.\n\nStan never wanted to leave the love of his life, but the pull of the woods was too strongÃ¢â‚¬â€and Riley was firmly planted in the city. Reconnecting is painful, but Stan still jumps at the chance to stay with his old flame during the Market. And damn the consequences.\n\nAs the weeks pass, the two grow closer than ever. But despite scorching sex and cozy intimacy, they both know they face a cold and lonely future. Unless one of them can compromise.\nGenre: MM Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f58693d06f4608716edcefbff0a79df11c1d5ad0","amp;dn":"Merry+Gentlemen+-+Josephine+Myles.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f58693d06f4608716edcefbff0a79df11c1d5ad0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,134,147,208,111,70,8,113,110,220,239,191,240,167,157,241,28,29,90,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
