He takes delivery of a 1970 Dodge Challenger to take from Colorado to San Francisco, California. Shortly after pickup, he takes a bet to get the car there in less than 15 hours. \nAfter a few run-ins with motorcycle cops and highway patrol they start a chase to bring him into custody. \nAlong the way, Kowalski is guided by Supersoul - a blind DJ with a police radio scanner. \nThrow in lots of chase scenes, gay hitchhikers, a naked woman riding a motorbike, lots of Mopar and you've got a great cult hit from the early 70's. \n\n\nNEDERLANDSE ONDERTITELS - SRT FILE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a5dfefea010ce7af315cac3526dc6339c26d444","amp;dn":"Vanishing+Point+-+1971","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a5dfefea010ce7af315cac3526dc6339c26d444","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,93,254,254,160,16,206,122,243,21,202,195,82,109,198,51,156,38,212,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
