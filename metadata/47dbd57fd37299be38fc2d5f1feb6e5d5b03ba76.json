After placing an ad in Melody Maker, Davies assembled Supertramp alongside co-founders Roger Hodgson (vocals, piano, guitar, cello), Richard Palmer (vocals, guitar, balalaika), and former stage actor Robert Millar (percussion, harmonica). Supertramp released two long-winded progressive rock albums before Miesegaes withdrew his support, and by early 1972, Davies and Hodgson were the only founding members remaining. The pair began an extensive search for replacements and soon pieced together the lineup that would be responsible for Supertramp's definitive sound, comprising new members Doug Thomson (bass), Bob Siebenberg (percussion), and John Helliwell (woodwinds, saxophone, keyboards).\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Surely (Edit)\n02.Your Poppa Don't Mind\n03.Land Ho\n04.Summer Romance\n05.School\n06.Bloody Well Right\n07.Dreamer\n08.Rudy\n09.Crime Of The Century\n10.Sister Moonshine\n11.Ain't Nobody But Me\n12.Lady\n13.Two Of Us\n14.Give A Little Bit\n15.Downstream\n16.Even In The Quietest Moments\n17.From Now On\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Gone Hollywood\n02.The Logical Song\n03.Goodbye Stranger\n04.Breakfast In America\n05.Oh Darling\n06.Take The Long Way Home\n07.You Started Laughing (Live)\n08.It's Raining Again\n09.My Kind Of Lady\n10.Don't Leave Me Now\n11.Cannonball\n12.Free As A Bird\n13.You Win, I Lose\n14.Another Man's Woman (Live)\n15.Over You\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ****You Don't Have To Thank Me.
