The Schnabel/Harwood picture follows Bauby's story to the letter -- his instantaneous descent from a wealthy and congenial playboy and the editor of French Elle, to a bed-bound, hospitalized stroke victim with an inactive brain stem that made it impossible for him to speak or move a muscle of his body. This prison, as it were, became a kind of &quot;diving bell&quot; for Bauby -- one with no means of escape. With the editor's mind unaffected, his only solace lay in the &quot;butterfly&quot; of his seemingly depthless fantasies and memories. Because of Bauby's physical restriction, he only possessed one channel for communication with the outside world: ocular activity. By moving his eyes and blinking, he not only began to interact again with the world around him, but -- astonishingly -- authored the said memoir via a code used to signify specific letters of the alphabet. In Schnabel's picture, Mathieu Amalric tackles the difficult role of Bauby; the film co-stars Emmanuelle Seigner, Marie-JosÃƒÂ©e Croze, Anne Consigny, and Patrick Chesnais. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d5bfc124867f55cf290ba0555aecad3ad83cefb","amp;dn":"Le+Scaphandre+et+le+Papillon+2007+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d5bfc124867f55cf290ba0555aecad3ad83cefb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,91,252,18,72,103,245,92,242,144,186,5,85,174,202,211,173,131,206,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
