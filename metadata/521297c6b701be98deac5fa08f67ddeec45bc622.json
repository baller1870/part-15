The set is divided equally into four sections -- disc one for his astounding solo electric and acoustic guitar sides, disc two for studio recordings with various groups, disc three for various live recordings solo and with groups, disc four the delicate Ella Fitzgerald and other duo partner sessions and quartet pieces backing Sarah Vaughan. Though the box is not in chronological order -- which is not necessary here, since Pass was essentially a finished, non-evolving artist when he joined Pablo -- Jim Ferguson's helpful commentary on the sessions is chronologically organized, balancing out Benny Green's personalized disc-by-disc analysis of the tracks. A couple of tracks with a modern Brazilian rhythm section also stand out, as does the supercharged &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown&quot; with Oscar Peterson and Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen, and the set's lengthiest item, a fond ten-and-a-half-minute take out on &quot;Stompin' at the Savoy&quot; live at Donte's club in North Hollywood, CA. The latter track and a scant two others are the only ones new to CD, and there are no unreleased goods to be heard, but with five hours of Pass taken a little at a time, this box will wear very well over the years. ~ Richard S.
