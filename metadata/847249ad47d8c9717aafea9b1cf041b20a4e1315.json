Hoke\n\nCM. Hoke has written this book in non technical terms with easy to follow instructions. This book will get you up to speed in the world of refining precious scrap in its 369 pages of simple, pure knowledge. \n\nThis book is the result of many years of teaching jewelers and others how to refine their precious metal wastes. Instructions start with tasks that are easy to understand and perform, assuming that the reader has never seen the process of refining. They continue through more complicated methods of handling various types of waste. \n\nOrgininally printed in the 1940's (i think)\n\n\nCan be downloaded from http://www.goldrefiningforum.com (very good information site with load of topics on the subject.)\n\n\n\n\nI have not seen this on here, so I thought I would give it an upload.....\n\n\nenjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:847249ad47d8c9717aafea9b1cf041b20a4e1315","amp;dn":"Refining+Precious+Metals+Wastes+by+CM.+Hoke","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"847249ad47d8c9717aafea9b1cf041b20a4e1315","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,114,73,173,71,216,201,113,122,175,234,155,28,240,65,178,10,78,19,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
