Recorded January 17 and 18, 1970 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ just a few weeks before the release of Morrison Hotel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ these concerts find Jim Morrison, John Densmore, Robby Krieger, and Ray Manzarek locked in tight as they deliver smoking takes on soon-to-be-classics from their forthcoming album.\n\nFans will be blown away by the crisp sound found on LIVE IN NEW YORK. All four shows were mixed and mastered by the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s longtime engineer, Bruce Botnick, who recorded a number of shows from The DoorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ 1970 tour on multi-track tape for the Absolutely Live album. Sadly, these shows represent The DoorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ final New York City performances with Morrison, who passed away July 3, 1971. \n\nMusic Info:\n\nThe difference between this torrent and other torrents like it is that I converted the original FLAC files to mp3 format and even more importantly took the time to fix all the Titles and ID3 tags!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nDisc 1 is 256 kbps CBR. \nDiscs 2-6 are VBR 200 +\n\n\nENJOY.
