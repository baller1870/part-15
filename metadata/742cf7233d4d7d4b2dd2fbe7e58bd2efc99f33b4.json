Yet, have you ever wondered how hundreds of men on the frontline are fed under fire or in the trench lines? During the Great War troops were trained to make meals out of the bare minimum of ingredients, to feed a company of men from only a mess tin and cook curries to feed hundreds only yards from the frontline. Feeding Tommy brings together recipes from the WWI with hints and tips from the Tommy Cook. Many recipes are illustrated with cartoons and drawings on how to assemble the perfect oven and kitchen tools at a momentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s notice from nothing. This book is the perfect inspiration for those who like to create an amazing meal anywhere, anytime, from anything. Includes dual measurements.\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:742cf7233d4d7d4b2dd2fbe7e58bd2efc99f33b4","amp;dn":"Feeding+Tommy%3A+Battlefield+Recipes+from+the+First+World+War+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"742cf7233d4d7d4b2dd2fbe7e58bd2efc99f33b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,44,247,35,61,77,125,75,45,210,251,231,229,139,210,239,201,159,51,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
