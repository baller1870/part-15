It has been certified Platinum in the US and peaked at #3 on the US Billboard 200 chart in 1963.\n\n\n The original Elvis' Golden Records, Vol. 3 was, like its predecessors, an unprecedented release -- no one in rock &amp; roll up to that point, other than Elvis, had ever legitimately earned a second greatest-hits volume, much less a third. This is also the place where the legitimately softer, more mature Presley replaces the angry young Elvis represented on the first two volumes. On a sexual level, songs like &quot;Stuck on You,&quot; &quot;It's Now or Never,&quot; &quot;Fame and Fortune,&quot; &quot;I Gotta Know,&quot; and &quot;Surrender&quot; offer seduction rather than diverting violation. He might no longer have been a rebel, but as represented on the original ten songs of this album, he was still making the Top Five and even the top of the charts regularly with work that was legitimately fine early-'60s rock &amp; roll and pop/rock. &quot;His Latest Flame&quot; or &quot;Good Luck Charm&quot; might not have been groundbreaking musical statements of the caliber of &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; or &quot;Blue Suede Shoes,&quot; but in Elvis' hands they were worth hearing over and over. The original 12 songs have been augmented by six more, including &quot;Can't Help Falling in Love&quot; (which should have been on this disc to begin with) and the hauntingly beautiful &quot;Girl of My Best Friend,&quot; which was a number two hit in England (and may be the prettiest song Elvis ever cut), plus &quot;Wild in the Country&quot; and &quot;Wooden Heart&quot; (a hit in Europe) from G.I. Blues.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - It's Now or Never\n 02 - Stuck on You\n 03 - Fame and Fortune (Remastered)\n 04 - I Gotta Know\n 05 - Surrender\n 06 - I Feel so Bad\n 07 - Are You Lonesome Tonight\n 08 - (Marie's the Name Of) His Latest Flame\n 09 - Little Sister\n 10 - Good Luck Charm\n 11 - Anything That's Part of You\n 12 - She's Not You","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:911a3af87fcc1ed8481dbe0ffc4837ff3495ed7c","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+Elvis+Golden+Records+Vol.3+%281963%2F2015%29+24%2F96","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"911a3af87fcc1ed8481dbe0ffc4837ff3495ed7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,26,58,248,127,204,30,216,72,29,190,15,252,72,55,255,52,149,237,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
