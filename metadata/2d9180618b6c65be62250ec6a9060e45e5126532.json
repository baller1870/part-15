Nothing quite compares to sitting down with a young child and hearing the sound of John Williamsâ€™s score as those beloved golden letters fill the screen. In this fun, erudite, and often moving book, Cass R. Sunstein explores the lessons of Star Wars as they relate to childhood, fathers, the Dark Side, rebellion, and redemption. As it turns out, Star Wars also has a lot to teach us about constitutional law, economics, and political uprisings. In rich detail, Sunstein tells the story of the filmsâ€™ wildly unanticipated success and explores why some things succeed while others fail. Ultimately, Sunstein argues, Star Wars is about freedom of choice and our never-ending ability to make the right decision when the chips are down. Written with buoyant prose and considerable heart, The World According to Star Wars shines a bright new light on the most beloved story of our time. Praise for The World According to Star Wars â€œStar Wars is the ultimate mythological tale of our age, a heroâ€™s journey that is a tribute to the beauty of human freedom as well as an exploration of its dark complexities. In this gem of a book, the brilliant Cass Sunstein uses the series to explore profound questions about being a parent, a child, and a human. It will change the way you think about your own journey, and it might even make you pick up the phone and call your dad.â€â€”Walter Isaacson â€œIrresistibly charming, acclaimed legal scholar Sunstein writes partly as a rigorous academic and partly as a helpless fanboy as he explores our fascination with Star Wars and what the series can teach us about the law, behavioral economics, history, and even fatherhood. This book is fun, brilliant, and deeply original.â€â€”Lee Child â€œFor anyone who loves the movies, or loves to think about how the world works, or simply loves their father, this book will provoke and inspire.â€â€”Duncan Watts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d9180618b6c65be62250ec6a9060e45e5126532","amp;dn":"The+World+According+to+Star+Wars+%282016%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d9180618b6c65be62250ec6a9060e45e5126532","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,145,128,97,139,108,101,190,98,37,14,198,169,6,14,69,229,18,101,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
