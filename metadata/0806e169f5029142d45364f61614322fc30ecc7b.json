HANSSON later pursued with the more jazzy album &quot;Magician's Hat&quot; in '73 and, then with a second winner in '75 entitled &quot;Attic Thoughts&quot;, which features a much better sound than the &quot;Lord&quot; album. This time, violin and acoustic guitars are added to the mix while organs and synths swell in impressive solos. &quot;Music Inspired by Watership Down&quot; (1977), however, was quite a disappointment and signalled HANSSON's decline. He finally released &quot;Mitt I Livet&quot; in 1985 but the flame had already died long ago. Having turned 60 in April 2003, he is now rumoured to be incapacitated by illness and has ceased recording.\n\nBoth &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Attic Thoughts&quot; are a must for any collector of early Swedish prog, even if you still can't tell Gandalf from Frodo.\n\n[b]Review (original version)[/b]\nNo amount of Lord Of The Rings soundtracks or versions will depict the very nature of Middle earth more accurately than Bo Hansson's version. This album oozes themes around Elves, Hobbits, Black Riders, The Grey Havens, Lothlorien and so on. The simplistic organ and guitar sounds together with basic percussion make this concept album an aural delight. Looking back I can see why the Charisma label snapped this Swedish artist up. He is no doubt the most underrated artist of the progressive rock genre.If one had never read the book, Hansson would have reached some place inside you with the feel of this album. As a whole the complete work is essential listening but to highlight certain tracks listen to ' Flight To The Ford', ' The Ring Goes South' and ' The Old Forest' How could Hansson depict a world so completely and so accurately? Listen and you will begin to understand the genius at work.\n\n\n[b]Track listing[/b]\n1. Leaving Shire\n2. The Old Forest &amp; Tom Bombadil\n3. Fog On The Barrow-Downs\n4.
