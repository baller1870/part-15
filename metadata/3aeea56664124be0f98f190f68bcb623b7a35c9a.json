He also explained in his letter to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL)\nthat the song was meant to demonstrate the hatefulness of racism, anti-Semitism and stereotyping. He said: &quot;My intention was for this song\nto say &amp;#039;no&amp;#039; to racism, anti-Semitism and stereotyping. I intend to include, in all albums that have not been shipped as of this date,\nthe above paragraph so that no one can listen to my music and misconstrue my intentions. Just the idea that my lyrics could offend\nand hurt anyone&amp;#039;s feelings is extremely painful to me.&quot;\nStill under pressure, Jackson then tried to prove his good intentions as he withdrew HIStory from the market, altered the controversial\nwords and re-released it on his own expense.\nThe original music video for the song showed Jackson singing the song in a prison. MTV took the video off its playlist because it showed\nscenes of violence. Jackson and video director Spike Lee did another version of the video set in Brazil.\nOther sources claim that &quot;The original music video, which was shot in March, on the streets of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil was reportedly\nnot &amp;#039;entirely\nsatisfactory&amp;#039; to Michael&amp;#039;s liking, so a second music video, the &amp;#039;Prison Version&amp;#039;, was made a week later. However ironically this new music\nvideo was\nbanned in some countries due to complaints that it was too violent, and on both MTV and VH1 it was only allowed to be shown after the 9 o&amp;#039;clock\nwatershed.&quot;\n\n--- File Information ---\nZrodlo - Source:\nNazwa pliku - File Name: Michael Jackson - They Don&amp;#039;t Care About Us [SyNtEr].avi\nWielkosc pliku-Size (in bytes): 81,723,494\n--- Container Information ---\nTyp pliku - File type: AVI(.AVI), Subtype: OpenDML (AVI v2.0),\nInterleave (in ms): 40, Preload (in ms): 384\n--- Video Information ---\nVideo Codec: Type: H264/x264, Name: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC\nCzas-Time (hh:mm:ss): 7:16.880\nIlosc klatek: 12721672 frames\nObraz Szer x Wys - Size (pixels): 640 x 480\nStorage Aspect Ratio(SAR): 1.333\nPixel Aspect Ratio (PAR): 1.000\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 1.333\nKlatek na sek. - FPS : 25.000\nVideo Bitrate (kbps): 1041\nKodowanie: ////\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame: 0.136&quot;\n--- Audio Information ---\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3, Audio alignment: Split\nAudio: Sample Rate (Hz):48000, Bitrate(kbps): 448, Bitrate Type: CBR, Channel : 6","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3aeea56664124be0f98f190f68bcb623b7a35c9a","amp;dn":"Michael+Jackson+-+They+Don%5C%27t+Care+About+Us+%5BDVDRip-SyNtEr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3aeea56664124be0f98f190f68bcb623b7a35c9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,238,165,102,100,18,75,224,249,143,25,15,104,188,182,35,183,163,92,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
