It will take considerable quantities of each to resolve all the challenges facing Vivenna and Siri, princesses of Idris; Susebron the God King; Lightsong, reluctant god of bravery, and mysterious Vasher, the Warbreaker","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6a45fef4571fccd84d5373e514e6c0daa2746b6","amp;dn":"Brandon+Sanderson+-+Warbreaker+%28Warbreaker+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6a45fef4571fccd84d5373e514e6c0daa2746b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,164,95,239,69,113,252,205,132,213,55,62,81,78,108,13,170,39,70,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
