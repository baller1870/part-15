It's A Wonderful Christmas features nine original songs and one standard performed by Michael and a 67-piece orchestra, recorded at London's famous Abbey Road Studios. This album is perhaps the most anticipated seasonal release this year, so don't be left out in the cold without it! Columbia.\n\nAllmusic Review:\nReview by Jared Johnson \nSmitty's third holiday album was epic in scope, with four choirs and a 65-piece orchestra offering plenty of Christmas grandeur. Close to half of the album is instrumental, which drew comparisons to 2000s Freedom. The vocal numbers like &quot;The Promise&quot; and &quot;Christmas Morning&quot; draw Smith's trademark personal touch. The album falls somewhere between 1989's Christmas and 1998's Christmastime, utilizing the full sound of the backing groups to its greatest extent. In its best moments, the album exudes the same mastery of the adult contemporary sound as Jim Brickman's The Gift. Give credit to this contemporary Christian vet for adding so richly to the Christmas songbook at a point in his career that so few reach and at which even fewer make meaningful contributions to their respective genres. \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5ee61f73311f517d52c1c3ee5c53d9a3e9e1be3","amp;dn":"Michael+W.+Smith+-+Its+a+Wonderful+Christmas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5ee61f73311f517d52c1c3ee5c53d9a3e9e1be3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,238,97,247,51,17,245,23,213,44,28,62,229,197,61,154,62,158,27,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
