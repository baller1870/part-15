It was filmed and first screened in 1996 and released along with select prints of the film Thinner.\n\nThe film tells the story of a scary Maestro with supernatural powers, who is being forced out of a small town by its mayor, pictured as a comically arrogant, plump man who bears more than a passing resemblance to Thomas Sneddon (the main prosecutor in Jackson's infamous child sexual abuse case from three years earlier). The movie includes a series of dance routines performed by Michael Jackson and his &quot;family&quot; of ghouls. Every song from the film was taken from Michael Jackson's HIStory and Blood on the Dance Floor albums.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:544ef2f07adb41e9586ea2dada6a49dc3b5e2487","amp;dn":"Michael+Jackson%27s+Ghosts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"544ef2f07adb41e9586ea2dada6a49dc3b5e2487","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,78,242,240,122,219,65,233,88,110,162,218,218,106,73,220,59,94,36,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
