It seems you&amp;#039;ve been dared to spend the night in the dilapidated old museum, which was never open to the public due to a bizarre incident that took place many years ago. Two teenagers and the professor himself disappeared under unknown circumstances, and you must solve the mystery if you&amp;#039;re to survive until dawn.\n\nWindows XP compatible\n\n[R+M]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c8932b0051a282e7c5bb1c2768e9acfcc1c305e","amp;dn":"Shivers+-+PC+Game+-+1995+%5BR%2BM%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c8932b0051a282e7c5bb1c2768e9acfcc1c305e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,137,50,176,5,26,40,46,124,91,177,194,118,142,154,207,204,28,48,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
