It's a horror game unlike any other, and as you'll discover, its truths are entirely subjective.\n\nChanges in 1.3.4:\n\nBugfixes, and generally new things. Enjoy it, folks.\n\nIf you like it, please buy it. Support the developer.\n\n(Sorry for the long wait, I've had a ton of things going on. Anyways, enjoy!)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a29a7eef9f5705bb073a3da7145e910defddc3bb","amp;dn":"Home+1.3.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a29a7eef9f5705bb073a3da7145e910defddc3bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,154,126,239,159,87,5,187,7,58,61,167,20,94,145,13,239,221,195,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
