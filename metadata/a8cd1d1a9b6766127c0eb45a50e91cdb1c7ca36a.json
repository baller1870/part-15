The show has since continued with different espionage conflicts throughout the seasons, but the show is always run in real-time format. \n\n18 months after season 7 (September 2016), The story arc involves Jack Bauer contending with assassination threats made during a peace conference between President of the United States Allison Taylor and President Omar Hassan of the fictional Islamic Republic of Kamistan (IRK), a country similar to Iran. Kamistani citizens, resentful of their nation's treatment at American hands and disappointed at Hassan's willingness to concede their attempts at developing nuclear weapons, turn against their country with the secret aid of the Russian mob, first attempting to assassinate Hassan and then to strike at America directly.\nThe season is set in New York City, with CTU's New York City Office having been re-activated, but while there were originally no plans for filming in New York due to budget constraints, some scenes were shot on-location.\n\nFor those who don't know the show, I included a little trailer I made.\n\nFormat :\tXvid\nFile size:  \t359 MiB avg per episode\nDuration : \t42min avg. per episode\nWidth : \t624 pixels\nHeight : \t352 pixels\nAspect ratio : \t16:9\nFrame rate : \t23.976 fps\nAudio: \t\tMP3\nNr of Files:\t24 + 1(Trailer by [man-o-tor])\n\nAll files properly named, keeping the original filenames intact, I don't take credit for what I didn't do!
