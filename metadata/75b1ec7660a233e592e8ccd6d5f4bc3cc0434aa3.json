Edits made with Audacity.\n\nThis an updated final version of my compilation. The Cardinal Jams (originally Discs 7-8) have been removed and are now included in the &quot;Sing You A Song&quot; Jam &amp; Improv Collection (updated 6 CD final version coming soon). Although &quot;Petal In A Rainstorm&quot; was released by now, I found it to be too pretty to be taken out. I included &quot;Testy, Testy&quot; and &quot;21st Century Wars&quot;, since unlike the available demos the live versions have lyrics.\n\nWhile working on the FLAC version of this (you can find it here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11249819/Ryan_Adams_-_Rough__amp__Mellow_(1994-2014)_Live_Collect._FLAC) I upgraded and fixed a couple of songs, so I had to update the mp3 version I posted a couple of months ago one final time. I also corrected the date on Lord, Tell Me How It's Gonna Be and added The Door, for which I had to move things around a bit. This is the last version of this collection.\n\n\nDisc 1 - 1994-1998\n\n01. Patty Duke Syndrome - Maybe I (1994-02-04)\n02. Patty Duke Syndrome - Darkened Veins (1994-02-04)\n03.
