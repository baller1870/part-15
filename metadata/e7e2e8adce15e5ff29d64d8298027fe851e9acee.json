They are kept company by an evangelist missionary (John Lithgow) and his wife (Darryl Hannah). The preacher and his followers want to preach to the primitive Niaruna Indians, while others are interested in the Niaruna for more diabolical reasons-specifically, business concerns that would like to claim the Indians' land for development. The local police chief cuts a deal with the mercenaries Lewis and Wolf: if they will agree to bomb the Niarunas out of existence, they will be paid enough money to leave the country. Instead, Lewis, part Native American himself,aligns himself with the Niarunas. From this moment on, he and the tribe are doomed. A long-standing pet project of producer Saul Zaentz, At Play in the Fields of the Lord was adapted from the best-selling novel by Peter Matthiesen. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\nFull New York Times Review \n\nAll the movie was filmed in AmazÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´nia, Brazil.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101373/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101373/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7e2e8adce15e5ff29d64d8298027fe851e9acee","amp;dn":"At.Play.In.The.Fields.of.The.Lord.1991.DVDRip.XViD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7e2e8adce15e5ff29d64d8298027fe851e9acee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,226,232,173,206,21,229,255,41,214,77,130,152,2,127,232,81,233,172,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
