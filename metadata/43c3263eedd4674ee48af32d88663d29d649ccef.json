They formed in England under the name The Congregation, but changed their name to English Gongregation in 1972 to avoid confusion with other similarly named bands. The group's lead singer was Brian Keith, and they had a hit single in the U.S. and Europe with &quot;Softly Whispering I Love You&quot; (a song originally written in 1967 by Roger Cook and Roger Greenaway, who recorded it as David and Jonathan), which peaked at #29 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It also reached #4 on the UK Singles Chart,[1] number 1 in South Africa and #10 in Germany.\nThe group released a further single (&quot;Jesanel&quot;) which did not chart, and faded into obscurity; Keith later became a session musician. The lack of further chart presence, left them as transatlantic one-hit wonders.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43c3263eedd4674ee48af32d88663d29d649ccef","amp;dn":"The+Congregation++-+Softly+Whispering+I+Love+You+-+320+-+Vinylri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43c3263eedd4674ee48af32d88663d29d649ccef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,195,38,62,237,212,103,78,228,138,243,45,136,102,61,41,214,73,204,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
