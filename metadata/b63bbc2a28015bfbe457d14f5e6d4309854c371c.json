Faced with such a burden, Mark Oliver Everett is surprisingly resilient--although not without remorse. As the leader of the alternative-rock band the Eels, Everett has already built a reputation for wry wit and lyrical candor, and this book epitomizes the X-Generation attitude towards mortality with its deadpan humor and world-weary cynicism. Everett pulls the ultimate postmodern trick when he recruits fellow Eel The Chet to do the narration. Essentially &quot;playing&quot; his band mate, Chet has a snide tone, as impassive as that of a DJ on a college radio station. It's the perfect vehicle to assert Everett's identity as a cynical post-Boomer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b63bbc2a28015bfbe457d14f5e6d4309854c371c","amp;dn":"Mark+Oliver+Everett+-+Things+the+Grandchildren+Should+Know","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b63bbc2a28015bfbe457d14f5e6d4309854c371c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,59,188,42,40,1,91,251,228,87,209,79,94,109,67,9,133,76,55,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
