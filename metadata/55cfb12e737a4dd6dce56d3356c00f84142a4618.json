Fritz Lang made two unconventional westerns, this one and &quot;Rancho Notorious&quot;. In both films he did not follow the usual standards. The best moments here take place in court, where Frank is being judged, by a very partial jury, where even the judge was an ex confederate officer. Henry Hull gives quite a performance, whereas in &quot;Jesse&quot; he kept repeating himself. Gene Tierney is excellent as the young reporter who is almost a &quot;fan&quot; of Frank James. But the great actor here is Henry Fonda as Frank, unforgettable.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55cfb12e737a4dd6dce56d3356c00f84142a4618","amp;dn":"The+Return+Of+Frank+James+%28Henry+Fonda%29+%5B1940%5D+%40+.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55cfb12e737a4dd6dce56d3356c00f84142a4618","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,207,177,46,115,122,77,214,220,229,109,51,86,192,15,132,20,42,70,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
