Ms. Massie writes her book with much warmth and love for the Irish people, their culture and their history. In addition to the straightfoward historical facts, the author adds sidebar information which reflects little extras of humor, language, and Irish life. There is even a recipe for soda bread included! All of these combined kept me reading smoothly way past my bedtime! The only complaint I have is that Ms. Massie aims her book toward people of Irish descent, with the impression that one is only interested in reading about Irish history and culture if one has a little Irish in them. I don't, but have always been interested in Irish history and culture anyway. I'm not Irish, but wish I was. Does that count, Ms. Massie?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:927109d04cb73428f9c9343675d6a461bbcfb5b6","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Idiot%5C%27s+Guide+to+Irish+History+and+Culture","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"927109d04cb73428f9c9343675d6a461bbcfb5b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,113,9,208,76,183,52,40,249,201,52,54,117,214,164,97,187,207,181,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
