The body of a teenage boy is found, emptied of blood, the murder rumored to be part of a ritual killing. Twelve-year-old Oskar is personally hoping that revenge has come at long last-revenge for the bullying he endures at school, day after day.\n\nBut the murder is not the most important thing on his mind. A new girl has moved in next door-a girl who has never seen a Rubik's Cube before, but who can solve it at once. There is something wrong with her, though, something odd. And she only comes out at night. . . .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83d593b0358a219097a7d90d9d6b49a493aa1a30","amp;dn":"John+Ajvide+Lindqvist+-+Let+The+Right+One+In","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83d593b0358a219097a7d90d9d6b49a493aa1a30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,213,147,176,53,138,33,144,151,167,217,13,157,107,73,164,147,170,26,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
