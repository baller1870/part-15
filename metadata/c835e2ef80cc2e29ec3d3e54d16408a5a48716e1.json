Eddie offers to speak to his father (Grant Mitchell) about getting him a job, only discover that his father has himself just lost his own. Eddie sells his beloved car and gives the money to his father, but when his father remains unemployed, the bills keep piling up, and the family is threatened with eviction. Eddie and Tommy decide to leave home to ease the burden on their families. They board a freight train, where they meet Sally (Dorothy Coonan), another teenager, who is hoping her aunt in Chicago can put her up for a while. More and more teens hop aboard the train.\n\nWhen they reach Chicago, they are met by the police. Most of the transients are sent to detention, but Sally has a letter from her aunt, so they let her through. She claims her companions are her cousins; the kindly policeman is skeptical, but lets them go. Sally's Aunt Carrie (Minna Gombell) welcomes all three into her apartment. However, before they even have a chance to eat, the place is raided by the police. The trio hastily depart and continue heading east.\n\nNearing Cleveland, one girl, caught alone, is raped by the train brakeman (an uncredited Ward Bond). When the others find out, they start punching the assailant. By accident, the brakeman falls out of the train to his death. A little later, as the train approaches the city, everyone jumps off. Tommy hits his head on a switch and falls across the track in front of an oncoming train. He crawls desperately towards safety, but his foot gets mangled and his leg has to be amputated. They live in &quot;Sewer Pipe City&quot; for a while, until the city authorities decide to shut it down, in part due to Eddie's theft of a prosthetic leg for Tommy.\n\nFinally, the three end up living in the New York Municipal Dump. Eddie finally lands a job, but needs to find $3 to pay for a coat he has to have. They panhandle to raise the money. \n\nWhen two men offer Eddie $5 to deliver a note to a movie theater cashier across the street, he jumps at the chance. The note turns out to be a demand for money. Eddie is arrested, and the other two are taken in as well when they protest. The judge (Robert Barrat) cannot get any information out of them, particularly about their parents. However, Eddie's embittered speech moves him. He promises to get Eddie's job back for him and dismisses the charges.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 855 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 1:06:00\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 1:06:00","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c835e2ef80cc2e29ec3d3e54d16408a5a48716e1","amp;dn":"Forbidden+Holywood+Collection+Vol.+3+-+Disk+3+-+Xvid+1cd+-+Wild+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c835e2ef80cc2e29ec3d3e54d16408a5a48716e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,53,226,239,128,204,46,41,236,61,62,84,209,100,8,165,164,135,22,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
