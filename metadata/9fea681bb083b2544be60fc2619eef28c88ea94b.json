In addition, she revived the singer/songwriter traditions of the '70s while re-establishing the piano as a rock &amp; roll instrument. With her 1992 album Little Earthquakes, Amos built a dedicated following that expanded with her second album, Under the Pink, before giving way to a decade-spanning legacy. \n\n\nGenre................: Pop\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2012\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded:............: Cover, Cue, Audiochecker\n\n\nTracks:\n\n01.America\n02.Trouble's Lament\n03.Wild Way\n04.Wedding Day\n05.Weatherman\n06.16 Shades Of Blue\n07.Maids Of Elfen-Mere\n08.Promise\n09.Giant's Rolling Pin\n10.Selkie\n11.Unrepentant Geraldines\n12.Oysters\n13.Rose Dover\n14.Invisible Boy\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\n Buy it if you like it!\n\n Thanks for Seeding\nCheers...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fea681bb083b2544be60fc2619eef28c88ea94b","amp;dn":"Tori+Amos+-+Unrepentant+Geraldines+%282014%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fea681bb083b2544be60fc2619eef28c88ea94b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,234,104,27,176,131,178,84,75,230,15,194,97,158,239,40,200,142,169,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
