The bigger you are, the more power you have, especially in the business world.\n\nDirector Anat Baron takes you on a no holds barred exploration of the U.S. beer industry that ultimately reveals the truth behind the label of your favorite beer. Told from an insiderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s perspective, the film goes behind the scenes of the daily battles and all out wars that dominate one of AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s favorite industries.\n\nBeer Wars begins as the corporate behemoths are being challenged by small, independent brewers who are shunning the status quo and creating innovative new beers. The story is told through 2 of these entrepreneurs - Sam and Rhonda - battling the might and tactics of Corporate America. We witness their struggle to achieve their American Dream in an industry dominated by powerful corporations unwilling to cede an inch.\n\nThis contemporary David and Goliath story is ultimately about keeping your integrity (and your familyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s home) in the face of temptation. Beer Wars is a revealing and entertaining journey that provides unexpected and surprising turns and promises to change the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s opinion on those infamous 99 bottles of beer on the wall.\n\n***\n\n\n\nOenophiles have SIDEWAYS and BOTTLE SHOCK; now their beer-loving counterparts can claim a film as their own. This truly American tale looks at the struggle between big breweries (Coors, Miller, and Budweiser) and their smaller competition (such as Dogfish Head) as the companies fight for shelf space and bar orders. Directed by Anat Baron, this documentary not only looks at the beer industry, but also examines the plight of small businesses in America.

Decide for yourself.\n- Mutineer Magazine\n\nThis feature-length independent documentary goes behind the scenes of the U.S. beer industry, revealing the struggles of independent brewers and their battles against the corporate beer giants.
