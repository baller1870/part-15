Seals's maiden 21st-century release, Lettin' Go, once again encapsulates all the things that have cemented that identity for an international following: painfully jagged guitar riffs, uncompromising, emotional vocals, and chops cut on a lifetime of jook joints and hard livin'. The record represents something of a departure for this notorious traditionalist. An acoustic guitar opens the record, which in Seals's repertoire is a rare sound indeed. Tracks like &quot;Blues Holy Ghost&quot; incorporate gospel stylings and sentiments. There's even a more-or-less straight-up rock track here, &quot;Osceola Rock,&quot; and a guest appearance from Trey Anastasio from the rock band Phish. Still, when you hear Seals going to work on dirty, soulful workouts like &quot;Bad Blood,&quot; there's no doubt where this man's true talents lie. \n\nTracklist\n1. Bad Blood 4:47\n2.
