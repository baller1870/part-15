Songs in different renditions. From a single guitar and a small or acoustic version to complete bands that go full throttle with an electric set. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve recorded them all.\n\n\n\nThe 2 Meter Sessions were founded in 1987 by Dutch TV- and radio host Jan Douwe Kroeske, when we recorded the first 2 Meter Session with New-Zealanders Crowded House. Since then, the archive has grown into a amazing total of 1460 sessions. Ranging from bands of different genre, age and fame. To give you an idea, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve recorded from Nirvana to Eels. With Radiohead, Low Anthem, dEUS and Yeasayer in between. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve met up with Joe Cocker, Southside Johnny &amp; the Ashbury Jukes, Aerosmith, JJ Cale, James Taylor, Tony Joe White and Jackson Browne. We werenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even too shy to record with Sepultura and Tool. In short: WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re willing to record anything that we consider to be true and good music.\n\n\n\nWe have several friends with professional studios in Amsterdam where we record these 2 Meter Sessions for television and radio. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll broadcast them along the way at HollandsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ alternative radio station KinkFM. Where Jan Douwe, or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“JDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, has two shows: 2 Meter into the Air every day from 7:00 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:00 Dutch time, and 2 Meter Live, every thursday night from 22:00 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢till midnight Dutch time. DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t mind the language, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll understand the music. You can listen to the station at any time and place. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s online with iTunes at www.kinkfm.com.\n\n\n\nAlso, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve had two seasons of 2 Meter Sessions: The Conversation. A talkshow with guests from the world of music who gets to pick three songs out of the archive, talks about the fragments and additionally plays a 2 Meter Session in the TV studio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.
