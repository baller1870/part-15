The spirit of the session is laid-back and eclectic, as the pair draws on everyone from Blind Lemon Jefferson and Blind Boy Fuller to Fats Domino and Merle Travis. There are also a half-dozen originals that might not be as captivating as the covers, but they certainly elicit engaging performances from the pair. Throughout Cool Down, John Cephas dominates the music but Phil Wiggins' harmonica steals the show whenever he pops through the cracks. Cool Down is the kind of album that demonstrates how some blues musicians simply get better with age.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/cool-down-mw0000180402&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/cool-down-mw0000180402&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTracks :\n 1.
