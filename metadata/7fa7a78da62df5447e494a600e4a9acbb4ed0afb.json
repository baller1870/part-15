Grilled Cheese and Bacon (9:33)\n02. Polka Dots and Moonbeams (6:59)\n03. Donna Lee (5:48)\n04. Alone Together (7:07)\n05. Save Your Love for Me (6:12)\n06. Blues for Joe F. (6:55)\n07. When Sonny Gets Blue (5:43)\n08. All About My Girl (4:28)\n\nTotal Time: 52:45\n\nPersonnel:\n- Joey DeFrancesco - Hammond B3 organ,\n- Houston Person - tenor saxophone (tracks 1-2, 4-7),\n- Paul Bollenback - guitar,\n- Byron Landham - drums.\n\nRecorded at Van Gelder Recording Studio, Englewood Cliffs, NJ on March 9, 1994.\n\nFormat: MP3 320 kbit/s. All songs are tagged by the book.\n\n--------\n\nThis is swinging, exciting playing that equals any organ group you have heard. Tenor sax player Houston Person adds immeasurably to this group with his soulful playing. Joey's long-time associates Paul Bollenback on guitar and Byron Landham on drums cannot be improved on. The album title 'All About My Girl' is somewhat deceptive in that the songs are not all about girls, although we hear about 'Donna Lee' and 'Sonny Gets Blue'. To quote Joey, it is more about wanting 'to get together and do what we love, playing blues and standards'. In fact, Joey calls this one of his favorite albums. Good luck in finding this out of print Muse label recording.\n\n--------\n\nIf you encounter errors during the file sharing, please, place this material as close to the root of the hard disk as possible and restart the file sharing (e.g. as close as possible to C: in Windows). This is in order to make the path (drive, directory and filename) as short as possible. Operating systems have limits regarding how long a path including the filename can be, and if this limit is exceeded there will be errors.\n\n--------\n\nL Hammond, The Pirate Bay, where you'll find more jazz organ.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fa7a78da62df5447e494a600e4a9acbb4ed0afb","amp;dn":"Joey+DeFrancesco+-+All+About+My+Girl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fa7a78da62df5447e494a600e4a9acbb4ed0afb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,167,167,141,166,45,245,68,126,73,74,96,14,74,154,203,180,237,10,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
