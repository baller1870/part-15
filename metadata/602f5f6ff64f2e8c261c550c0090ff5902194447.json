Warren Ellis weaves a superb story about a dangerous new type of combat armor, and Iron Man's attempts to secure the stolen prototype before the host causes too much damage. Along the way, we are introduced to old friends of Tony's and new there is new emphasis on the business side of Stark Enterprises - a thread that Matt Fraction would pick up and run with in his own acclaimed Iron Man stories. Also, Tony is shown as a vulnerable human, which makes some of his decisions with regard to the new technology even more...err, extreme. This Digital TPB collects all 6 issues of Iron Man v4 (2005) and is the work of Minutemen-InnerDemons. Thanks to them, and please seed - enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:602f5f6ff64f2e8c261c550c0090ff5902194447","amp;dn":"Iron+Man+-+Extremis+TPB+%282007%29+%28Digital%29+%28Minutemen-InnerDemons%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"602f5f6ff64f2e8c261c550c0090ff5902194447","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,47,95,111,246,79,46,140,38,28,85,12,0,144,255,89,2,25,68,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
