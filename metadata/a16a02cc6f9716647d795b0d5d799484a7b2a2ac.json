A master hunter, his ability to poach game in-season or out is the only thing that stands between him and the soup kitchen line. Until Moon trespasses on the wrong land, hears a rustle in the brush, and fires a single fateful shot.\n\nFollowing the bloody trail, he comes upon a shocking scene: an illegal, deep woods campground filled with drugs, bundles of cash and the body of a dead young woman, killed by Moon's stray bullet.\n\nFaced with an ultimate dilemma, Moon has to make a choice: does he take the money and ignore his responsibility for the girl's death? Or confess?\nBut before he has a chance to decide, Moon finds himself on the run, pursued by those who think the money is theirs. Men who don't care about right and wrong and who want only one thing from John Moon: his body, face down in a ditch.\n\nGenre: Mystery","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a16a02cc6f9716647d795b0d5d799484a7b2a2ac","amp;dn":"A+Single+Shot+by+Matthew+F+Jones+%26amp%3B+Daniel+Woodrell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a16a02cc6f9716647d795b0d5d799484a7b2a2ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,106,2,204,111,151,22,100,125,121,91,13,93,121,148,132,167,178,162,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
