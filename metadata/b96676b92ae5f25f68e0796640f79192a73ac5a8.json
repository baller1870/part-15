All releases are made from the first generation master tape and mastered at half-speed, allowing for the finest sound quality possible. In the past, MFSL has produced cassette tapes, LPs, CDs, and even VHS releases of a few titles. In addition, each title is licensed to be mastered, manufactured, and sold within a specific time frame, and because of the limited quantities produced, the releases are highly sought after by collectors.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b96676b92ae5f25f68e0796640f79192a73ac5a8","amp;dn":"The+Who+-+Who+Are+You+%28MFSL%29+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b96676b92ae5f25f68e0796640f79192a73ac5a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,102,118,185,42,229,242,95,104,224,121,102,64,247,145,146,167,58,197,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
