This has always been so, and is likely to remain so. Race has marred our past and clouds our future. It is a particularly agonizing and even shameful dilemma because, in so many other ways, the United States has been a blessing to its people and a model for the world.\n\nThe very discovery by Europeans of a continent inhabited by Indians was an enormous crisis in race relationsÃ¢â‚¬â€a crisis that led to catastrophe and dispossession for the Indians. The arrival of the first black slaves to Virginia in 1619 set in motion a series of crises that persist to the present. Indirectly, it brought about the bloodiest war America has ever fought, Reconstruction, segregation, the civil rights movement, and the seemingly intractable problems of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s underclass.\n\nDespite enormous effort, especially in the latter half of this century, those two ancient crises remain unresolved. Neither Indians nor blacks are full participants in America; in many ways they lead lives that lie apart from the mainstream.\n\nAfter 1965, the United States began to add two more racial groups to the uneasy mix that, in the heady days of civil rights successes, seemed finally on the road to harmony. In that year, Congress passed a new immigration law that cut the flow of immigrants from Europe and dramatically increased the flow from Latin America and Asia. Now 90 percent of all legal immigrants are nonwhite, and Asians and Hispanics have joined the American mix in large numbers. The United States has embarked on a policy of multiracial nation-building that is without precedent in the history of the world.\n\nRace is therefore a prominent fact of national life, and if our immigration policies remain unchanged, it will become an increasingly central fact. Race, in ever more complex combinations, will continue to be the great American dilemma.\n\nNevertheless, even as the nation becomes a mix of many races, the quintessential racial divide in AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â€the subject of this bookÃ¢â‚¬â€is between black and white. Blacks have been present in large numbers and have played an important part in American history ever since the nation began. Unlike recent immigrants, who are concentrated in Florida, California, New York, and the Southwest, blacks live in almost all parts of the country. Many of our major cities are now largely populated and even governed by blacks. Finally, for a host of reasons, black/white frictions are more obtrusive and damaging than any other racial cleavage in America.\n\nIn our multiracial society, race lurks just below the surface of much that is not explicitly racial. Newspaper stories about other thingsÃ¢â‚¬â€housing patterns, local elections, crime, antipoverty programs, law-school admissions, mortgage lending, employment ratesÃ¢â‚¬â€are also, sometimes only by implication, about race. When race is not in the foreground of American life, it does not usually take much searching to find it in the background.\n\n416 pages\nPublisher: Carroll &amp; Graf Pub; 1st Carroll &amp; Graf ed edition (November 1992)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0881848662\nISBN-13: 978-0881848663","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68df7ded6a4398e1720a71f1447ca1a83af99fb9","amp;dn":"Paved+With+Good+Intentions+%281992%29+by+Samuel+Jared+Taylor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68df7ded6a4398e1720a71f1447ca1a83af99fb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,223,125,237,106,67,152,225,114,10,113,241,68,124,161,168,58,249,159,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
