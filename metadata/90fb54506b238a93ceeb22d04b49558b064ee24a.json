Searching for a rational explanation of the changing styles of art, Gombrich reexamines many ideas on the imitation of nature and the function of tradition. In testing his arguments he ranges over the history of art, noticing particularly the accomplishments of the ancient Greeks, and the visual discoveries of such masters as Leonardo da Vinci and Rembrandt, as well as the impressionists and the cubists. Gombrich's triumph in Art and Illusion arises from the fact that his main concern is less with the artists than with ourselves, the beholders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90fb54506b238a93ceeb22d04b49558b064ee24a","amp;dn":"Art+and+Illusion+%28Gombrich+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90fb54506b238a93ceeb22d04b49558b064ee24a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,251,84,80,107,35,138,147,206,235,34,208,75,73,85,139,6,78,226,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
