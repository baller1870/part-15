The sparse, countrified tone is new for her Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it was recorded in Arizona, with Howe Gelb producing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but fits the reflective mood of the songs, half of them written after her father suddenly died and her marriage ended. The hallmark is delicacy: every song feels fragile. The track Made of Glass even has fragility as its subject Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a friend who died of cancer left her a vase, which inspired this gently strummed meditation about breakable gifts. How You Kill Me is also full of pathos; &quot;Just as I sing like a bird, you shoot me down for your fun,&quot; she accuses, over brushed cymbals and hypnotic bass. Waiting on the Heart is the most alt-country moment Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Gelb has made free with the pedal steel and reverb, and it's a stunner. In fact, there's little here that doesn't make you wonder where Tunstall has been hiding all this beauty until now.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71213f1a57b02db20fd7059fb827e797e050724b","amp;dn":"KT+Tunstall+-+Invisible+Empire+%2F%2F+Crescent+Moon+%5B2013%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71213f1a57b02db20fd7059fb827e797e050724b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,33,63,26,87,176,45,178,15,215,5,159,184,39,231,151,224,80,114,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
