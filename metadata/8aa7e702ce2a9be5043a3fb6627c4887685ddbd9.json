SCHLACHTER\n\n\n\nPUBLISHER : APRESS\nLANGUAGE : ENGLISH\nRELEASE TYPE : RETAIL\nFORMAT : PDF\nRELEASE DATE : 2013/09/19\nISBN : 9781782160700\nSTORE DATE : 2013\n\n\nLink : http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17137899-invest-like-an-institution?ac=1\n\n\n\n\n\nAll too often, when investors go in search of investment advice, they are met\nwith television personalities and so-called investment &quot;gurus&quot; who do little\nmore than push the latest and greatest scheme to retire rich. Your retirement\nfunds-in the form of IRAs, 401(k)s, SEP or Simple IRAs, and other plans you\ncan direct to some degree-are, however, far too precious to bet on the latest\nscheme, trend, or tip you heard at a party. In Invest Like an Institution:\nProfessional Strategies for Funding a Successful Retirement, Michael\nSchlachter provides individual investors with the tools they need to build a\nportfolio that not only protects their wealth but helps it grow for the long\nterm. Result? A comfortable retirement in which you can pursue your dreams\nand check &quot;bucket list&quot; items off at your leisure.\n\nAs an advisor to large pension funds and endowments, Michael Schlachter\ncounts among his clients the elite. Institutional investors like the\nretirement systems of states and major companies, as well as the largest\nuniversity endowments, are among the few that consistently outperform the\nmarket. Sure, average retail investors can't make the same types of private\ndeals in real estate, private equity, or hedge funds that institutional\ninvestors use to reap large returns or offset market volatility. But as this\nbook demonstrates, you can replicate in your own portfolio the very same\ndiversification strategies that large funds employ to achieve long-term\ngains. To that end, Invest Like an Institution shows how to build a\nportfolio that is every bit as diversified and risk-controlled as a\nmulti-billion-dollar institutional fund-and a portfolio more likely to\nresult in a happy, financially secure retirement.\n\nDesigned specifically for the individual investor, Invest Like an Institution will appeal to active investors and savers of all ages, from Baby Boomers who are closing in on retirement to young adults who are struggling to determine the proper way to manage their investments and direct their asset allocation mix.\n================\n\nDovah\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8aa7e702ce2a9be5043a3fb6627c4887685ddbd9","amp;dn":"Michael+C.+Schlachter%2C+Invest+Like+an+Institution%2C+pdf+%5Bdovah%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8aa7e702ce2a9be5043a3fb6627c4887685ddbd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,167,231,2,206,42,155,229,4,58,63,182,98,124,72,135,104,93,219,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
