They have a folk sound with dark sometimes religious lyrics (not a christian band, just as religious as most folk songs get) some songs are mellow, but there&amp;#039;s a fair share of fast moving and interesting songs.  Definitely not a band that&amp;#039;s boring to listen to.\n\n&quot;Five guys, maybe three shirts between them, take to the stage. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a banjo, a fiddle, a drum set littered with gas cans, chains, and broken cymbals. Then they all start howling, stomping; itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an anachronistic jug band party in a junkyard with sing-along hooks and weathered vocals from another time.&quot; taken from odeath dot net \n\nO&amp;#039;Death - Head Home (2007)\nbit rate = 320\n\ntrack listing:\n\n01 Adelita\n02 All the World\n03 Allie Mae Renolds\n04 Busted Old Church\n05 Down To Rest\n06 Face Mask\n07 Gas Can Row\n08 Ground Stump\n09 Jesus Look Down\n10 Nathaniel\n11 O Lee O\n12 Only Daughter\n13 Rickety Fence Teeth\n14 The Crab Apple Switch\n15 Travelin&amp;#039; Man","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:929f53d14fe259968affb56f2bb9c2f8879fd02b","amp;dn":"O%5C%27Death+-+Head+Home","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"929f53d14fe259968affb56f2bb9c2f8879fd02b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,159,83,209,79,226,89,150,138,255,181,111,43,185,194,248,135,159,208,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
