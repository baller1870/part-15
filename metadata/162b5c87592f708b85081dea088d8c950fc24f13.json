It was released in 1987 by Napalm Records. It was re-released by Peaceville Records in 1993, as part of a 2CD split with Relentless in 1996, and then again in 2005 as a digipak. Joe Hasselvander originally played drums on only one track, &quot;Burning Savior,&quot; with Stuart Rose recording the drums on all the rest. Hasselvander re-recorded drums on all tracks (except &quot;Burning Savior&quot;) for the '93 Peaceville Reissue. The original mixes with Rose on drums only appear on the Napalm Records LP version and have never appeared on CD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:162b5c87592f708b85081dea088d8c950fc24f13","amp;dn":"Pentagram+-+Day+Of+Reckoning+%281987%29+%5BReissue+2005%5D+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"162b5c87592f708b85081dea088d8c950fc24f13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,43,92,135,89,47,112,139,133,8,29,234,8,141,140,149,15,194,79,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
