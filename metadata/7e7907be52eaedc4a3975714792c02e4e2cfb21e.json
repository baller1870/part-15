THE LAST ONE'S THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE TO ME BECAUSE IT'S A BIT PERSONAL. I'M TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE INTERVIEW. BUT THE FIRST QUESTION: BHAGWAN, I'VE HEARD YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE AN ORDINARY MAN. IN AUSTRALIA WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD CONSIDER THEMSELVES AS ORDINARY PEOPLE. WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR ORDINARINESS AND THEIR ORDINARINESS?\r\n\r\nANSWER:* There is great difference.
