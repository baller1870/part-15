Perhaps an odd word to use given that Violator continued in \nthe general vein of the previous two studio efforts by Depeche Mode: Martin \nGore's upfront lyrical emotional extremism and knack for a catchy hook filtered \nthrough Alan Wilder's ear for perfect arrangements, ably assisted by top English \nproducer Flood. Yet the idea that this record would both dominate worldwide \ncharts, while song for song being simply the best, most consistent effort yet \nfrom the band could only have been the wildest fantasy before its release. The \nopening two singles from the album, however, signaled something was up. First \nwas &quot;Personal Jesus,&quot; at once perversely simplistic, with a stiff, arcane \nfunk/hip-hop beat and basic blues guitar chords, and tremendous, thanks to sharp \nproduction touches and David Gahan's echoed, snaky vocals. Then &quot;Enjoy the \nSilence,&quot; a nothing-else-remains-but-us ballad pumped up into a huge, dramatic \nromance/dance number, commanding in its mock orchestral/choir scope. Follow-up \nsingle &quot;Policy of Truth&quot; did just fine as well, a low-key Motown funk number for \nthe modern day with a sharp love/hate lyric to boot. To top it all off, the \nalbum itself scored on song after song, from the shuffling beat of &quot;Sweetest \nPerfection&quot; (well sung by Gore) and the ethereal &quot;Waiting for the Night&quot; to the \nguilt-ridden-and-loving-it &quot;Halo&quot; building into a string-swept pounder. &quot;Clean&quot; \nwraps up Violator on an eerie note, all ominous bass notes and odd atmospherics \ncarrying the song. Goth without ever being stupidly hammy, synth without \nsounding like the clinical stereotype of synth music, rock without ever sounding \nlike a &quot;rock&quot; band, Depeche here reach astounding heights indeed. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                          SOME WIKIPEDIA INFORMATION\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nViolator is the seventh studio album by the English electronic group Depeche \nMode, released by Mute Records on March 19, 1990. Preceded by the hit singles \n&quot;Personal Jesus&quot; and &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot; (a Top 10 hit on both sides of the \nAtlantic), Violator propelled the band into international stardom. The album \nyielded two further hit singles, &quot;Policy of Truth&quot; and &quot;World in My Eyes&quot;. This \nalbum is the first of the band to achieve the Top 10 on the Billboard 200ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nreaching #7ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and staying 74 weeks in the chart. It was supported by the World \nViolation Tour.\n\nAs part of Mute's 2006 reissue schedule, Violator was re-released as a hybrid \nSuper Audio CD + DVD-Video package on April 3, 2006 which included two-channel \nand 5.1 surround mixes of the album. The six B-sides to the Violator \nsinglesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½&quot;Dangerous&quot;, &quot;Memphisto&quot;, &quot;Sibeling&quot;, &quot;Kaleid&quot;, &quot;Happiest Girl&quot;, and \n&quot;Sea of Sin&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½also appear, albeit without the surround sound treatment. The \nreissue didn't reach the US till June 6, 2006. The US version lacked the hybrid \nSACD and instead just had a CD, but the DVD was included, and was identical to \nthe European DVD.\n\nA 32-minute short film entitled Depeche Mode 1989-90 (If You Wanna Use Guitars, \nUse Guitars) and featured interviews with the band Daniel Miller, Flood, \nFranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois Kevorkian (who mixed the album), Anton Corbijn (who directed the music \nvideos and did the album's photography/cover), and others. It also includes news \nfootage from the infamous &quot;riot&quot; in Los Angeles which gave the band media \npublicity the day before Violator came out. The band were scheduled to do \nautographs in an LA music store, and the line reached into the 10,000's. The \nevent had to be cancelled shortly after it began due to problems keeping the \nline in order. There is also footage from Strange Too, notably clips from the \nmusic videos for &quot;Halo&quot; and &quot;Clean&quot;.\n\nThe remastered album was released on &quot;deluxe&quot; vinyl March 2, 2007 in Germany and \nMarch 5, 2007 internationally.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       SOME TRACKS REVIEWED AT ALLMUSIC\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWORLD IN MY EYES     by Tim DiGravina\n\nThe first thing that becomes abundantly clear when &quot;World in My Eyes&quot; kick- \nstarts Violator is that Depeche Mode has massively upgraded its sound. Where \nthings were somewhat rough and minimal on past albums, a new fullness or \nlushness is in place. The hiring of producer and all-around musical guru Flood \nto co-produce the album is most likely the catalyst for the sound upgrade. Where \nindustrial-tinged bangings and clangings marked the band's output on the \nimmediately preceding albums, Violator absolutely charges to life without \npretense. &quot;World in My Eyes&quot; sees David Gahan's vocals in the foreground, but \nMartin Gore's high-pitched background vocals stalk Gahan step for step. The \nlyrics detail a lover's wish to &quot;show you the world in my eyes.&quot; Such a conceit \nis classic Depeche Mode. Through sexuality and love, Gahan/ Gore's lover will \nsee the world through the eyes of the singers. Twitching, perfectly-in-tune \nelectronic samplers and keyboards race around the musical map as Gahan implores \nthat no map is needed at all, because his &quot;body [will] do the moving, and [his] \nhands [will] do the soothing.&quot; A somewhat lo-fi beat, almost reminiscent of a \nvideo game, loops throughout the track's running time. Gorgeous keyboards rest \non the loop's base, as alternating piercing and bubbly electronic effects \nskitter about in a beautiful, complex arrangement. &quot;World in My Eyes&quot; is a \nglorious start to Violator. \n\n\n\nSWEETEST PERFECTION    by Tim DiGravina\n\nThat &quot;Sweetest Perfection&quot; wasn't released as a single is a tribute to the fact \nthat Violator is such a masterpiece as a whole. It seems somewhat odd that \nMartin Gore handles the vocals, because Gore usually turns vocal duties over to \nDavid Gahan on more snarling numbers, but his vocals here are a kind of \nrevelation. Gore sounds positively bothered about his sweetest perfection, and \nhis lyrical obsession is tied up in the usual sexual and emotional imagery. It's \nhard to decipher if he's singing about a drug addiction or about human \nattraction, but his passionate delivery and dark words resonate powerfully over \nAlan Wilder's bleak, percolating shuffle. Infections and &quot;injections of any \nkind&quot; cause Gore to &quot;stop and stare too much, afraid that (he cares) too much&quot; \nas the sound of swirling strings and racing keyboard notes engulfs his voice. \nScreeching sampled guitars and ominous drum punches provide a brutal edge to the \nsong's otherwise bubbly underbelly. &quot;Sweetest Perfection&quot; is a song about \ndesperation, but it's about loving and even needing desperation in one's life. \nThat Gore feels comfortable singing a somewhat angry confessional, rather than \nhis usual redemptive ballad, is as much a testament to his ability as a \nsongwriter as it is to his maturity as an artist. \n\n\n\nPERSONAL JESUS     \tby Ned Raggett\n\nOne of the Depeche songs that seemingly everyone knows -- in large part thanks \nto blanket MTV coverage and record sales in late 1989 and early 1990 -- \n&quot;Personal Jesus&quot; saw Depeche tackling the ridiculous canard that &quot;bands without \nguitars don't make real music&quot; with vicious gusto. That Depeche had always used \nguitars in one form or another -- or that guitars or lack thereof don't \ndetermine quality -- had been ignored by said doubters, who had to swallow their \nwords as the group's knowing revamp of an old blues lick became a smash hit. \nStarting with a soft two-note guitar chime, a massive overdubbed vocal echoes up \n-- &quot;Reach out, touch faith!&quot; -- and the song is off, its distinct, big but \nshuffling rhythm created from samples of the band stomping on travel cabinets. \nCompared to the busy arrangements of recent songs like &quot;Strangelove&quot; and &quot;Never \nLet Me Down,&quot; &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; is a touch more spare, its extras more suggested \nin the mix than overtly calling attention to themselves, like the simple bass \nstabs or the brief orchestral swirls on the chorus. Otherwise, it's all beat, \nMartin Gore's not-a-note-wasted guitar twangs and slides and David Gahan's \nseductive delivery of a lyric inspired by Priscilla Presley's relationship with \nElvis. \n\n\n\nHALO     by Tim DiGravina\n\n&quot;Halo&quot; expertly merges a chilled but edgy dance beat and flanged guitar samples \nwith sweeping cinematic strings. Following the hard-rocking &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; on \nViolator, the song feels like a brisk drive down the highway in a convertible. \nUnderneath its suave atmosphere, the song is built on a companion melody to \n&quot;Policy of Truth.&quot; Indeed, &quot;Halo&quot; might be considered a kind of musical marriage \nbetween &quot;Policy of Truth&quot;'s steady, bubbly beat and &quot;Behind the Wheel&quot;'s fuzzy \ntension, of course merged with an artsy film score thanks to the recurring \nstrings. David Gahan's vocal delivery couldn't fit the music any better. He \nsings with a detached confidence, only sounding slightly worried as he sings \nabout the &quot;world falling apart&quot; and walls tumbling in. That &quot;Halo&quot; is actually a \nlove song is kind of remarkable. Buried beneath its electronic veneer and \ndriving rush of melody, Gahan sings that it will be worth it to face the worst \nthat life can offer just to have his lover fall into his arms. Even among the \nequally stellar moments on Violator, &quot;Halo&quot; stands tall as one of Depeche Mode's \nfinest songs. It's the sound of the band firing on all cylinders, and showing \ngreat sonic and thematic restraint in the process. \n\n\n\nWAITING FOR THE NIGHT     by Tim DiGravina\n\nDavid Gahan's hushed voice might dominate the musically minimal &quot;Waiting for the \nNight,&quot; but the song's somber electronic tones and Martin Gore's harmonies emit \na dark, touching cloud of their own. If one listens closely, Gore's voice \nmatches Gahan note for note through a majority of the song, adding vibrato and a \nhint of unease. The song opens with spare, bubbly digital notes, as if one is \nunder the spell of a futuristic art installation. Gahan and Gore sing repeatedly \nthat they are &quot;waiting for the night to fall.&quot; In the night everything is \n&quot;bearable&quot; and &quot;all that you feel is tranquility.&quot; Gore's closing moans are \nstark and haunting. It seems safe to say that previous to Violator, &quot;Waiting for \nthe Night&quot; wouldn't have been possible. Co-producer Flood's hand steadies \nDepeche Mode here, adding subtlety where before there may have been grit or a \nyearning toward realms more epic. That's not to say that Black Celebration and \nMusic for the Masses aren't gorgeously arranged and executed albums, but there's \na sense on Violator that every note and emotion is in its proper place. &quot;Waiting \nfor the Night&quot; is a powerful representation of how expertly Depeche Mode \nbalanced emotion and restraint in a sweeping musical vision at this point in its \ncareer. \n\n\n\nENJOY THE SILENCE     by Steve Huey\n\nLongtime underground favorites for their pioneering use of synthesizers in \nalternative rock, Depeche Mode finally scored their first (and only) Top Ten \nsingle in the U.S. with &quot;Enjoy the Silence,&quot; the second single from their 1990 \nbest-seller Violator. &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot; begins with a melancholy ballad feel \nin spite of the busy bass lines underneath; a clean-toned guitar plays a \nhaunting melody over synthesizers mimicking a gothic choir. The electronic beats \nbegin to kick in with greater prominence during the first chorus, and \nimmediately afterwards there is a funky percussion break which alerts the \nlistener to the song's rhythmic underpinning. When the rest of the \ninstrumentation returns, it's suddenly just as danceable as it is gloomy. The \nlyrical subject matter of &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot; is typical Depeche Mode bleakness, \nin this case with a more personal slant. Its main point is that the more people \ntalk, the more likely they are to hurt each other, and so a sense of doom hangs \nover the romance alluded to in the chorus (&quot;All I ever wanted, all I ever needed \nis here in my arms/Words are very unnecessary, they can only do harm&quot;). On a \ndeeper level, &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot; suggests that getting to know someone more \nintimately destroys any romantic illusions about them, and the singer seems to \nprize those illusions as a form of perfection that doesn't exist in the outside \nworld. It's a little solipsistic and all very dramatic, but the music supports \nthose ambitions with a chilly sadness and an austere grandeur that perfectly \nexpresses the sentiments of the lyrics. \n\n\n\nPOLICY OF TRUTH     by Tim DiGravina\n\nTaking hints from R&amp;B, yet adhering entirely to Depeche Mode's stylish \nelectronic swoosh, &quot;Policy of Truth&quot; is a silky smooth and funky highlight among \nhighlights from Violator. More than perhaps anywhere else previous to the album, \nvocalist David Gahan effects a kind of sinister, romantic croon. It's a style \nhe'd gravitate to again on Ultra and Exciter, though with perhaps more \nconfidence and humor on those later albums. From its groovy opening to its jazzy \ndance club conclusion, &quot;Policy of Truth&quot; oozes an addictive, uneasy kind of \nsuaveness. It's clear that the fuzzy, wobbly electronics come largely from Alan \nWilder and Flood, as Violator is largely considered to be Wilder's album, and \nbecause so much of Violator's success stems from Wilder's masterful, edgy \narrangements. Gahan isn't truly the star of the song, for better or worse, but \nbecause his voice takes a kind of background role, the smarmy keyboards, synths, \nand samplers absolutely bleed emotion and atmosphere. It's almost as if Gahan \nwas told to find an indifferent mood, stick with it, and let the music take \ncontrol. &quot;Policy of Truth&quot; feels experimental in construction, as electronic \nsounds ring out and disappear from just about every angle. But it's an \nexperiment that resoundingly works. That it's difficult to imagine a more \nperfect lead-in for the startlingly sweet &quot;Blue Dress&quot; is just another example \nof how great an album Violator is, in both its songs and its sequencing. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               EAC LOG EXTRACT\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4 from 23.
