All three parties co-own the property.\n\nThe series took place in Barrow, Alaska, so far north that during the winter the sun does not rise for 30 days. In the series, vampires, being vulnerable to sunlight, take advantage of the prolonged darkness to openly kill the townspeople and feed at will.\n\nInitially an unsuccessful film pitch, the series became a breakout success story for Steve Niles, whose previous works had received relatively little attention. It was also the first full-length work by co-creator Ben Templesmith. The series has been followed by numerous sequel series and, in 2007, was adapted into a film of the same name.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18ecd1676ae6e0d1ea2e4c6f8c6a9d82002a1bae","amp;dn":"30+Days+of+Night+%28Series%29+%5BComplete%5D+%2B+Extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18ecd1676ae6e0d1ea2e4c6f8c6a9d82002a1bae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,236,209,103,106,230,224,209,234,46,76,111,140,106,157,130,0,42,27,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
