Mikey made that rare progression from top radio DJ (on Jamaican National Radio) to actual recording artist, but he never strayed too far from his radio roots on his records. One of his earliest hit albums, AFRICAN ANTHEM, sounded a lot like his radio show, including shout-outs, announcements, drops, and skits tucked in among the mind-blowing dubs.\n\n01.
