With the help of complex computer animation and the research of hundreds of paleontologists, the BBC presents an extremely realistic picture of the earth's earliest, most primitive aquatic inhabitants and chronicles their evolution to the precursors of man himself and the mighty dinosaurs.\n\n\n\n1)Water Dwellers:\n=================\n\nThe first Walking With Monsters episode begins in the Cambrian period 530 million years ago, showcasing how a simple jellyfish-like sea creature evolved over 200 million years into new creatures with eyes and protective external and internal skeletal systems. These adaptations resulted in the world's first fish, arthropods, amphibians, and land-loving reptiles. \n\n\n\n\n2)Reptile's Beginnings:\n=======================\n\nThe second episode details the giant insects of the Carboniferous period 300 million years ago and demonstrates how evolution empowered amphibians and reptiles by creating mechanisms to regulate their own body temperature and developing specialized teeth.\n\n\n\n\n3)Clash Of Titans:\n==================\n\nThe final episode begins in the late Permian period 250 million years ago when the earth was essentially one large desert full of volcanic activity. While much of earth's life was extinguished during this period, adaptation and evolution continued, bringing the development of a specialized hip in a tiny reptile called the Euparkeria that would prove to be the forerunner of mammals and evolve into the dinosaurs in the Triassic period.\nWhile some criticize this project as a somewhat overly dramatic presentation of speculative paleontology as fact, this program utilizes scientific inference to bring pre-history to life and highlight the amazing adaptations and evolution of the earth's earliest inhabitants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Kenneth Branagh   \n============================\n\n\nProduced &amp; Directed by: Tim Haines &amp; Chloe Leland \n=================================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle............: Walking With Monsters-Life Before Dinosaurs[3 Episodes + Extras]\nYear.................: 2005\nGenre................: Documentary \nVideo Length.........: 00:28:29 - 00:29:03\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........: 128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........: MPEG Layer-3\nLanguage.............: English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.: 16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........: H264 \nVideo Resolution.....: 624x352\nVIdeo Bitrate........: 840 kbit/s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬ 857 kbits\n\n\nSubs.................: External English\nFile Size:...........: 174 x 4  MB           (Total size : 698 MB)\nFPS..................: 29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........: 2 channels\nRelease date.........: 5 November 2005\n\n\n\nH264:\n=====\n\n\n\nEpisodes:\n=========\n\n1)Water Dwellers\n2)Reptile's Beginnings\n3)Clash Of Titans\n4)Making Of &quot;Walking  With Monsters&quot;  EXTRAS\n\n\n\n\n \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0490048/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0490048/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD *****\t\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cf4d5edeb58afd863ed1ff7ac408eb434491394","amp;dn":"Walking+With+Monsters-Life+Before+Dinosaurs-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cf4d5edeb58afd863ed1ff7ac408eb434491394","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,244,213,237,235,88,175,216,99,237,31,247,172,64,142,180,52,73,19,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
