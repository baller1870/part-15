Studios, written by Michael Alan Nelson and drawn by Declan Shalvey.\n\nThe series follows on from the events of 28 Days Later, initially taking place in the gap between it and the sequel, 28 Weeks Later, much like the graphic novel 28 Days Later: The Aftermath, and as such references the upcoming American NATO occupation. Issue 22 directly references events from the second movie, and takes place in the same time frame.\n\n\nQuote:\n28 Days Later: The Aftermath is a graphic novel continuation of the hit film 28 Days Later written by Steve Niles and distributed by Fox Atomic Comics. It was released on April 3, 2007.\n\nThe book bridges the gap between the original film and its sequel, 28 Weeks Later. It explores four interconnecting stories and delves deeper into the development of the Rage virus, the battle for survival that ensued once it was unleashed in London, and what it finally took to restore order in the ravaged city.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_Days_Later_%28comics%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_Days_Later_%28comics%29&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_Days_Later:_The_Aftermath&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_Days_Later:_The_Aftermath&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hypergeek.ca/2009/08/comic-review-28-days-later-1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hypergeek.ca/2009/08/comic-review-28-days-later-1.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://comicbookdb.com/title.php?ID=23998&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://comicbookdb.com/title.php?ID=23998&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://comicbookdb.com/title.php?ID=13268&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://comicbookdb.com/title.php?ID=13268&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/28-days-later/49-27555/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/28-days-later/49-27555/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/28-days-later-the-aftermath/49-22590/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/28-days-later-the-aftermath/49-22590/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nContains:\n\n28 Days Later #01.cbr 11.1 MB\n28 Days Later #02.cbr 7.05 MB\n28 Days Later #03.cbr 10.0 MB\n28 Days Later #04.cbr 10.3 MB\n28 Days Later #05.cbr 11.5 MB\n28 Days Later #06.cbr 11.5 MB\n28 Days Later #07.cbr 11.4 MB\n28 Days Later #08.cbr 10.1 MB\n28 Days Later #09.cbr 13.1 MB\n28 Days Later #10.cbr 12.3 MB\n28 Days Later #11.cbr 12.6 MB\n28 Days Later #12.cbr 11.9 MB\n28 Days Later #13.cbr 11.8 MB\n28 Days Later #14.cbr 15.7 MB\n28 Days Later #15.cbr 10.6 MB\n28 Days Later #16.cbr 10.2 MB\n28 Days Later #17.cbr 9.46 MB\n28 Days Later #18.cbr 11.2 MB\n28 Days Later #19.cbr 15.2 MB\n28 Days Later #20.cbr 11.7 MB\n28 Days Later #21.cbr 15.5 MB\n28 Days Later #22.cbr 12.0 MB\n28 Days Later #23.cbr 11.0 MB\n28 Days Later #24.cbr 11.4 MB\n\n28 Days Later - The Aftermath.cbr 79.1 MB\n\nTorrent downloaded from46 B ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00db95efaf01423dcb9e74e0b878e3f09f31e7f2","amp;dn":"28+Days+Later+++%28Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00db95efaf01423dcb9e74e0b878e3f09f31e7f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,219,149,239,175,1,66,61,203,158,116,224,184,120,227,240,159,49,231,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
