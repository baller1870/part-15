RegRun completes its initial checks during the very first steps of Windows initialization detecting thereby all automatically launched programs. \nThe second external check is made when a computer boots from a CD/USB device. This principle of double-checking offers a superb advantage: any suspicious code is removed prior getting a chance to run in your system. \n\nIt is easy to locate and to eliminate any inactive malicious software at this stage. It also becomes quite easy to discover any kernel rootkits, which hide their files away, as well as any registry and boot-record rootkits. \n\nEvery malicious code becomes visible as if it has been looked upon with a magnifier, whereby it is absolutely impossible neither to hide away nor to avoid the RegRun cure.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d1988fb8ca45e413a7feb581d98161439424231","amp;dn":"RegRun+Warrior+3.03.01.iso+bootable+disk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d1988fb8ca45e413a7feb581d98161439424231","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,25,136,251,140,164,94,65,58,127,235,88,29,152,22,20,57,66,66,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
