An elastic talent who moved easily from glossy ballads to hip-hop-inspired dance-pop, she earned frequent comparison to rivals Whitney Houston and Celine Dion, but did them both one better by composing all of her own material. Born in Long Island, NY, on March 27, 1970, Carey moved to New York City at the age of 17 -- just one day after graduating high school -- to pursue a music career; there she befriended keyboardist Ben Margulies, with whom she began writing songs. Her big break came as a backing vocalist on a studio session with dance-pop singer Brenda K. Starr, who handed Carey's demo tape to Columbia Records head Tommy Mottola at a party. According to legend, Mottola listened to the tape in his limo while driving home that same evening, and was so immediately struck by Carey's talent that he doubled back to the party to track her down.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Sweetheart\n02.When You Believe (From The Prince Of Egypt)\n03.Whenever You Call\n04.My All\n05.Honey\n06.Always Be My Baby\n07.One Sweet Day\n08.Fantasy\n09.Hero\n10.Dreamlover\n11.I'll Be There\n12.Emotions\n13.I Don't Wanna Cry\n14.Someday\n15.Love Takes Time\n16.Vision Of Love\n17.I Still Believe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n               ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b335907c7c5dc9dab6710951b8eadb15af2d6da","amp;dn":"Mariah+Carey+%231%5C%27s+%281998%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b335907c7c5dc9dab6710951b8eadb15af2d6da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,51,89,7,199,197,220,157,171,103,16,149,27,142,173,177,90,242,214,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
