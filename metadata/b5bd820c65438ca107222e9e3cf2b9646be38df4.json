In the room there lies a bed. Born of \ndemonic power, the bed seeks the flesh, blood and life essence of unwary travellers? \nThree pretty girls arrive on vacation, searching for a place to spend the night. \nInstead, they tumble into nightmares - and the cruel, insatiable hunger of the Bed! \nDeath Bed is a one-of-a kind experience: comic, horrific and dreamlike, that truly \nhas to be seen to be believed. Discover this neglected marvel of American horror for \nyourself!\n\n-WHAT REALLY HAPPENS-\n\tThere&amp;#039;s a bed. People sit on it. It eats them.\n\n-Notes-\nAfter seeing this movie in a Newbury Comics, how can you ignore something with a title like that? Every time I went in, I felt it beckon me. Finally after putting it off (was I afraid of it?) for almost a year, I broke down and got it. Its a trip, that&amp;#039;s for sure. At least its original; I can bet that you&amp;#039;ll never see something quite like this. At times I was unsure whether or not it was trying to be serious, or a satire, or what the fuck was going on. &amp;#039;Released&amp;#039; originally in 1977 with no credits whatsoever except for the title and &amp;#039;Copyright George Barry&amp;#039; it became somewhat of a mystery/uber-cult flick. Besides the father from Boy Meets World, this was pretty much the only film that anyone involved in it ever did.\n\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: Death.Bed.DVDRip.LRH.avi\nFilesize.....: 699 MB (or 716,702 KB or 733,902,848 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:17:27 (111,414 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1136 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID&amp;#039;d as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 119 kb/s (59/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.90.\u0002Ã‚Â°\nFrame Size...: 544x400 (1.36:1) [=34:25]\n\n\n-PAST RELEASES-\n\n1.
