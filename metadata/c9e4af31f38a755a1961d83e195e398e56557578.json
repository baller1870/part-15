The alt right rejects or oppose the underpinnings of postmodernism which has ruled media and policy in the western countries since the 60s. Hopefully this will mark the return of rationality, empirical science and reason to politics.\r\n\r\nAlso, some of these books are quite academic and will be hard to comprehend without some education in statistics or psychology. Most of them are however written for a larger audience.\r\n\r\nThis pack of ebooks includes the following topics:\r\n\r\n*Intelligence\r\n*Gender differences\r\n*Race differences\r\n*Evolutionary psychology\r\n*Cultural differences\r\n*Political correctness (PC) and media\r\n*Postmodernism and political ideologies\r\n\r\nIf you are offended by these ebooks, don't download them and go sit in a safe space where reality cannot hurt your feelings. Having a tantrum might also help","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9e4af31f38a755a1961d83e195e398e56557578","amp;dn":"Alt+Right%27s+introduction+eBooks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9e4af31f38a755a1961d83e195e398e56557578","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,228,175,49,243,138,117,90,25,97,216,62,25,94,57,142,86,85,117,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
