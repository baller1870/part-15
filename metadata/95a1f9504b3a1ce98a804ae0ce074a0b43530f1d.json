However, without having ever read a Post Bros story, or anything by Matt Howarth, I would still recommend this to people who enjoy the more offbeat and idiosyncratic of my uploads.\n\nAs far as the 'Those Annoying Post Bros' and 'Savage Henry' series go, as well as the vast amount of Matt's lesser known and harder to find books, many of which are also set in Bugtown, I'm working on putting those together as well. It's been VERY slow going. He has a huge number of books 'out there', but nobody seems to be scanning and sharing them. I'll post what I can as the pieces start to fit together.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Howarth&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Howarth&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMatt explains himself, in the introduction to this graphic novel, where this book fits chronologically.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95a1f9504b3a1ce98a804ae0ce074a0b43530f1d","amp;dn":"Matt+Howarth+-+Post-Mortem+%28Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95a1f9504b3a1ce98a804ae0ce074a0b43530f1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,161,249,80,75,58,28,233,138,128,74,224,206,7,74,11,67,83,15,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
