In a remote New Mexico location, Crow and his team, protected with chain-mail fang shields on their throats, blast away at a vampire nest, haul them out with the Jeep's winch, and then celebrate by pulling on other wenches at the Sun God Motel. Their revels are soon brought to an end by king vampire Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith), who became invulnerable after a bungled &quot;inverse exorcism&quot; during the 14th Century. Amid the motel mayhem, Jack escapes, along with his buddy Montoya (Daniel Baldwin) and hooker Katrina (Sheryl Lee). Since Katrina was already bitten by Valek, they use her as a decoy to locate Valek. Cardinal Alba (Maximilian Schell) sends padre Guiteau (Tim Guinee) to join Crow, who is unaware that Montoya has been bitten by Katrina. The hunt begins. Director Carpenter composed the film's music.\n\nRipped with Autogk.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 48 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73c7e2331eb3ee85cd031f62f0ce1b8c67930b77","amp;dn":"John+Carpenter%5C%27s+Vampires%281998%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73c7e2331eb3ee85cd031f62f0ce1b8c67930b77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,199,226,51,30,179,238,133,205,3,31,98,240,206,27,140,103,147,11,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
