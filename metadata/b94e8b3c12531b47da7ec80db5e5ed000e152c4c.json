The story focuses on three characters, Zoe Castillo, April Ryan, and Kian Alvane, who live in two parallel worlds: technologically advanced Stark and magical Arcadia. April was the protagonist of the first game, while the other two are new characters. The main storyline follows Zoe, a Stark resident who investigates her ex-boyfriend's disappearance and other mysterious occurrences that lead her to April. Meanwhile in Arcadia, April battles the villainous Empire of Azadi while Kian, an elite Azadi soldier, is sent to assassinate her. The game features returning characters from its predecessor, such as Brian Westhouse and Gordon Halloway, but playing &quot;The Longest Journey&quot; is not a prerequisite to understand its plot.\n\n\n\nKnown issues:\n-------------\nSometimes items in the inventory box are shown incorrectly.\n\n\n\nNow you can download the complete soundtrack for this fantastic game! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4993428/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4993428/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThis game was converted by thedoctor45 and fixed by me.
