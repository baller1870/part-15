In their last battle against an inhuman foe, two members of the Squad died while another remained in a coma and the only one to survive was Hardcase. The incident caused him to change careers and become an actor. While on the set of one of his movies, he is approached by a police officer that wants an autograph and inquires why Hardcase won't return to being a superhero. Before their conversation concludes, the police officer is summoned to a bank robbery. Hardcase declines to join him and the police officer rushes ahead. As Hardcase films his next scene, he can hear gunshots from the bank robbery and goes to investigate. There he meets Head Knocker, another super-powered ultra, who is trying to rob the bank and killed several people. He defeats Hard Knocker and decides he is out of retirement, pursuing his career as a crime fighter again","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:651c28fdbfcb0775b9e306f2cc21776d465cb574","amp;dn":"Hardcase+%28001+-+026%29+%281993+-+1995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"651c28fdbfcb0775b9e306f2cc21776d465cb574","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,28,40,253,191,203,7,117,185,227,6,242,204,33,119,109,70,92,181,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
