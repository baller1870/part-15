The critique itself is by Phillip Rushton and Arthur Jensen. \n\nIn the book, Nisbett argues that intelligence largely a byproduct of environmental factors, while this critique argues that genetics plays a larger role.\n\nThis is a must read for anyone interested in the nature/nurture debate over IQ and intelligence. The book critiqued can also be found on The Pirate bay.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:556ee035d0919b6b9c204cd37516a7c667cf5090","amp;dn":"Rushton+%26amp%3B+Jensen+Critique+of+Intelligence+and+How+to+Get+It","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"556ee035d0919b6b9c204cd37516a7c667cf5090","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,110,224,53,208,145,155,107,156,32,76,211,117,22,167,198,103,207,80,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
