The Wreckage is a truly epic, yet twisted, romance that unfolds over decades and continents. It engages readers on the austere shores of NewfoundlandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fishing villages and drags them across to Japanese POW camps during some of the worst events of the Second World War. Haunting, lyrical, and deeply intimate, CrummeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s language fully exposes his charactersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ vulnerabilities as they struggle to come to terms with their guilt and regret over decisions made during their impulsive youths. \nGenre: Fiction; Romance, History","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9567dfd7e6c56108191f16f5a2c0d0d01f14e7a","amp;dn":"The+Wreckage+by+Michael+Crummey.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9567dfd7e6c56108191f16f5a2c0d0d01f14e7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,86,125,253,126,108,86,16,129,145,241,111,90,44,13,13,1,241,78,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
