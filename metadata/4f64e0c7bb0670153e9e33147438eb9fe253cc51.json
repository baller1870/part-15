The album took almost 2 years to complete, and in October 2010 Ã¢â‚¬Ëœn Ware Verhaal was released through Rhythm Records, featuring powerful collaborations with Jack Parow, Tim Beumers (acclaimed Dutch rapper from Rotterdam), Tumi Molekane (Tumi &amp; the Volume), Inge Beckmann (Lark), Richard Brokensha (Isochronous/kidofdoom) and Sev Statik (Deepspace 5, from New York).\n\nAll BittereinderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music videos were produced, shot and directed by the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own mastermind, Louis Minnaar, and they all reached MKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Top 10 chart (South AfricaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s premier music TV channel), including a 3-week number 1 spot for the third single Ã¢â‚¬Å“Slechte MensenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. All 3 of their first singles reached number 1 chart positions on a number of radio stations across South Africa.\n\nFollowing a hugely successful and much anticipated national tour starting with seven cities in a month, Bittereinder crowned the excellent reception of their debut album by winning the SAMA (South African Music Award) for Best Afrikaans Alternative Album of 2011 at the SAMA Awards Ceremony in Johannesburg in May 2011. The album and the first video were also finalists in the 2011 Tempo Awards.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bittereinder.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bittereinder.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nALBUMS:\n\nWARE VERHAAL         2010\nDIE DINKDANSMASJIEN  2013\n\nALL TRACKS IN MP3 FORMAT, 256kbps\n\n\nSCANNED WITH ESET SMART SECURITY: NO THREATS OR INFECTIONS\n\nPLEASE SEED !!\n\nENJOY !!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f64e0c7bb0670153e9e33147438eb9fe253cc51","amp;dn":"Bittereinder++-++2+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f64e0c7bb0670153e9e33147438eb9fe253cc51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,100,224,199,187,6,112,21,62,158,51,20,116,56,235,159,226,83,204,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
