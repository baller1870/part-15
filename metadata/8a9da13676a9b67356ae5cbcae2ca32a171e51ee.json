This socially conscious scholar has some passionate theories about image. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clearly never taken, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Style 101.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Spending the last ten years buried in the books earning her PhD has left her with a wardrobe of immature college girl duds and a nasty habit of shopping for clothes in her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s closet. For Azi, fashion is frivolous and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll analyze and overanalyze to prove it.\n\nMediaInfo:\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 525 MiB\nDuration                         : 43mn 2s\nWriting application              : Lavf52.39.0\nWriting library                  : VirtualDub build 32842/release\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : DX50\nCodec ID/Hint                    : DivX 5\nDuration                         : 43mn 2s\nBit rate                         : 1 500 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 448 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.607\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.186\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 43mn 2s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 59.1 MiB (11%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a9da13676a9b67356ae5cbcae2ca32a171e51ee","amp;dn":"What.Not.To.Wear+s08e16+Azi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a9da13676a9b67356ae5cbcae2ca32a171e51ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,157,161,54,118,169,182,115,86,174,92,188,174,44,163,42,23,30,81,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
