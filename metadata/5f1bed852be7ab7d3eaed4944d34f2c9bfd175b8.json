Apu is now an adult seeking his fortune in the world and is an aspiring writer. One day, accompanying a friend to a wedding, Apu lands up marrying Aparna. Apu's happiness in finding his aoul mate is shortlived however, as Aparna dies at childbirth, leaving a son Kajol behind. A devastated Apu, leaves Kajol with his grandparents and goes travelling. Much later, he returns in his reunion with Kajol, both father and son find a meaning in life again..\r\n\r\nComments:\r\nFor me Apur Sansar has always been the favourite in the Trilogy. It is a more mature Ray than in Pather Panchali, the screenplay is much more complex with nuances that delight you when you think about them and Subrata Mitra's camera work is par excellence. This was also the last Ray film in which the music director is not Ray himself (Ravi Shankar). Shankar's musical genius is in full display in a restrained musical score that is in keeping with the earlier films of the Trilogy, lending a harmony that adds to the cinematic genius of Ray.\r\n\r\nUploader's Notes:\r\nThis 1080p rip is exactly like the original Blu-Ray but for some some very light sharpening. If you find a slightly excess grain in some screens, do take a note that in other scenes this grain actually adds to detail. I have also removed the letterboxing and restored the video to its original 4:3 ratio. The audio is the original pcm monoaural sound.\r\n\r\nDo check the sample. It is from the center of the film and will give you a very good idea of the quality.\r\n\r\nA 720p version is also being uploaded separately.\r\n\r\nIMDB Link: \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052572/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f1bed852be7ab7d3eaed4944d34f2c9bfd175b8","amp;dn":"APUR+SANSAR+%281959%29Criterion+BDRip-1080p-x264+PCM+Esubs-8GB-%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f1bed852be7ab7d3eaed4944d34f2c9bfd175b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,27,237,133,43,231,171,125,62,174,212,148,77,52,242,201,191,209,117,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
