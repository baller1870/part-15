Soar with condors over glacial peaks and explore monkey puzzle forests from the time of dinosaurs. Ride with extreme kayakers over raging waterfalls, and with Patagonia's cowboys - the gauchos - as they round up wild horses.\r\n__________________________________\r\n\r\nHeat and Dust\r\n\r\nFrom the Andes peaks, we follow the path of the relentless wind, sweeping east through Patagonia's dry desert. We discover a weird world of maras - giant guinea pigs - and desert-dwelling penguins, and witness the first faltering steps of baby guanacos - Patagonia's very own camels. People live here too - brave souls who have taken on this arid world and carved out a home.\r\n__________________________________\r\n\r\nLife on the Edge\r\n\r\nThis is the story of an awe-inspiring coastline, 4000 miles long. From the cold, fearsome waters of Cape Horn, where brave rockhopper penguins overcome huge challenges to raise their young, to the far north, with huge elephant seals battling for position in the heat of the desert. Orcas ram-raid the beaches, grabbing seal pups to feed their young. People gather the sea's bounty too, but these shores are not for the faint-hearted","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00f2f300123366cdf7d9fbdeb8b0779263df8e76","amp;dn":"Patagonia-Earths.Secret.Paradise.-BBC-S01-w.subs-720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00f2f300123366cdf7d9fbdeb8b0779263df8e76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,242,243,0,18,51,102,205,247,217,251,222,184,176,119,146,99,223,142,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
