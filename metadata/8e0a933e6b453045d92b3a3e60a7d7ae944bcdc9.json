Since steam did a very poor job of protecting this game,\nthere are some serious performance issues on less powerful computers. On\none of our systems the difference in FPS was approximately 50%. Because\nthe game has a frame limiter in place, it is best noticeable on less\npowerful PCs.\n\nAs a bonus we made it possible to play in zombie mode with our crack.\nSKIDROW also released an enabler for this, but their crack crashes when\ngoing back to menu.\n\n\n\n1. Unrar.\n2. Copy over the cracked content.\n3. Play the game.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e0a933e6b453045d92b3a3e60a7d7ae944bcdc9","amp;dn":"Call.of.Duty.Black.Ops.Crackfix-RELOADED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e0a933e6b453045d92b3a3e60a7d7ae944bcdc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,10,147,62,107,69,48,69,217,43,58,62,96,167,215,174,148,75,205,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
