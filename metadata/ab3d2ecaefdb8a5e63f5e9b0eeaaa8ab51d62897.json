Each gesture is\nillustrated. So we learn that stroking a beard in\nIsrael means 'I am deep in thought' and in\nAustria it means 'How boring'; in Christian\ncountries fingers crossed means protection,\nbut in Turkey the likely ending of a friendship.\nWhat is polite in one region is obscene in\nanother. What is friendly here is hostile there.\n       This unusual and provocative book\nguides us through the world of gestures and\nwill fascinate everyone interested in body\nlanguage.\n____________________________________________________________","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab3d2ecaefdb8a5e63f5e9b0eeaaa8ab51d62897","amp;dn":"Bodytalk%3A+A+World+Guide+to+Gestures","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab3d2ecaefdb8a5e63f5e9b0eeaaa8ab51d62897","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,61,46,202,239,219,138,94,99,245,233,176,238,170,168,171,81,214,40,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
