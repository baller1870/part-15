The projects in this book follow Spud, a feisty pet sheep, and ChloÃƒÂ«, his perky owner, as they travel to a farm and meet the inhabitants of the barnyard, including a brown cow, some mice, a dog, and a barn cat. To continue the theme, and set the stage for loads of interactive play, the book also offers instructions for making an assortment of farm props, such as a picket fence, bales of hay, dainty baskets, and even a three-sided foldable barn.\n\nMeanwhile, witty full-color cartoons (presented one per spread throughout the text of the book) tell the story of Spud and ChloÃƒÂ«Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s visit to the farm, which starts with an invitation from SpudÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cousin Little Lamb. Featuring charming full-color photographs of the knitted toys, this book is a must-have for knitters and their loved ones.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cce4e4e0c9a3b8a060a3c960b4b839b8330df7b","amp;dn":"Spud+and+Chloe+at+the+Farm+Knitting+Book","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cce4e4e0c9a3b8a060a3c960b4b839b8330df7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,206,78,78,12,154,59,138,6,10,60,150,11,75,131,155,131,48,223,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
