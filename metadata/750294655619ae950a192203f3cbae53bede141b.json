The riders tackle three climbs en-route, including Buttertubs Pass. The last 60km is flat though, and the winner - and the Tour's first yellow jersey wearer - will almost certainly be a sprinter. After missing out on stage one last year, Mark Cavendish will have extra motivation to be first across the line in Harrogate. Presented by Gary Imlach, with guest Chris Boardman, commentary by Phil Liggett and Paul Sherwen, and reporter Ned Boulting.\n\nTechnical Spec\nFilesize__: 552 MB\nRun-Time__: 45 min\nContainer_: MKV\nVideo_____: x264 CABAC Main L3.1 832x468 50fps CRF=26 ~1622Kbps\nAudio_____: HE-AAC VBR 2ch 48KHz Q=0.24 ~64Kbps\n\n5 hour live version coming up soon.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:750294655619ae950a192203f3cbae53bede141b","amp;dn":"ITV+Tour+de+France+2014+Stage+1+Highlights+PDTV+x264+AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"750294655619ae950a192203f3cbae53bede141b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,2,148,101,86,25,174,149,10,25,34,3,243,203,174,83,190,222,20,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
