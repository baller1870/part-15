Dalton clearly demonstrates how Gandhi's lifelong career in national politics gave him the opportunity to develop and refine his ideals. He then concludes with a comparison of Gandhi's methods and the strategies of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, drawing a fascinating juxtaposition that enriches the biography of all three figures and asserts Gandhi's relevance to the study of race and political leadership in America. Dalton situates Gandhi within the &quot;clash of civilizations&quot; debate, identifying the implications of his work on continuing nonviolent protests. He also extensively reviews Gandhian studies and adds a detailed chronology of events in Gandhi's life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:217859671b8965d2072669f3e57d5a7f0f2cee98","amp;dn":"Mahatma+Gandhi%3A+Nonviolent+Power+in+Action","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"217859671b8965d2072669f3e57d5a7f0f2cee98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,120,89,103,27,137,101,210,7,38,105,243,229,125,90,127,15,44,238,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
