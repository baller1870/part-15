Crossing the Rubicon discovers and identifies key suspectsÃ¢â‚¬â€finding some of them in the highest echelons of American governmentÃ¢â‚¬â€by showing how they acted in concert to guarantee that the attacks produced the desired result.\n\nCrossing the Rubicon is unique not only for its case-breaking examination of 9/11, but for the breadth and depth of its world pictureÃ¢â‚¬â€an interdisciplinary analysis of petroleum, geopolitics, narcotraffic, intelligence and militarismÃ¢â‚¬â€without which 9/11 cannot be understood.\n\nThe US manufacturing sector has been mostly replaced by speculation on financial data whose underlying economic reality is a dark secret. Hundreds of billions of dollars in laundered drug money flow through Wall Street each year from opium and coca fields maintained by CIA-sponsored warlords and US-backed covert paramilitary violence. AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s global dominance depends on a continually turning mill of guns, drugs, oil and money. Oil and natural gasÃ¢â‚¬â€the fuels that make economic growth possibleÃ¢â‚¬â€are subsidized by American military force and foreign lending.\n\nIn reality, 9/11 and the resulting Ã¢â‚¬Å“war on terrorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are parts of a massive authoritarian response to an emerging economic crisis of unprecedented scale. Peak OilÃ¢â‚¬â€the beginning of the end for our industrial civilizationÃ¢â‚¬â€is driving the ÃƒÂ©lites of American power to implement unthinkably draconian measures of repression, warfare and population control. Crossing the Rubicon is more than a story. It is a map of the perilous terrain through which, together and alone, we are all now making our way.\n\nMichael C. Ruppert is the publisher and editor of From the Wilderness, a newsletter read by more than 16,000 subscribers in 40 countries. A former Los Angeles Police Department narcotics investigator, he is widely known for his groundbreaking stories on US involvement in the drug trade, Peak Oil and 9/11.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:277e6286857e07d5995516c5d71f5df82460a38e","amp;dn":"Michael+C.+Ruppert%3A+Crossing+the+Rubicon%3A+The+Decline+of+the+Ame","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"277e6286857e07d5995516c5d71f5df82460a38e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,126,98,134,133,126,7,213,153,85,22,197,215,31,93,248,36,96,163,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
