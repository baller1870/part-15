A group of Neo-Nazis led by Adolf (Brenner), the self-proclaimed &quot;FÃƒÂ¼hrer of the new beach,&quot; takes advantage of the resulting chaos by fighting off several rival surfer gangs to seize control of the beaches. Meanwhile, an African American oil well worker named Leroy (Harden) is killed by the Nazis while jogging on the beach. Leroy's mother &quot;Mama&quot; Washington (Neely), devastated by the loss of her son, vows revenge. After arming herself with a handgun and grenades, she breaks out of her retirement home and exacts vengeance on the Surf Nazis.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f81cd169daebc267525966dd5d11945373326a7","amp;dn":"Surf+Nazi%27s+Must+Die+%281987%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f81cd169daebc267525966dd5d11945373326a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,129,205,22,157,174,188,38,117,37,150,109,213,209,25,69,55,51,38,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
