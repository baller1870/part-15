These selections are clear and the studio quality is excellent. Although the Lama Chopa is a single piece, it is comprised of 14 sections. It begins with arousing the inner meditative mind of the performer and the invocation of the forces of goodness from the ten directions. It then goes on through the stages of worship and meditation, and eventually concludes with a dedication to world peace. This ritual was written by the First Panchen Lama.\n\nAlthough there are two religious belief systems practiced by Tibetan people, Bon and Buddhism, most research and scholarship has been conducted on the majority religion, Buddhism. Both religious practices include recto-tono recitation, chanting, and similar instruments in their ritual celebrations. Bon, which predates Buddhism, has incorporated many outside elements, especially from Buddhism, although still preserving fundamentals of the religion including mythology.\n\nTibetan Buddhism has a very dense liturgical calendar and many rituals involving music surrounding it. Vocal choruses are frequently employed during these rituals, as well as ritual instruments. The music used in these rituals is usually based on oral tradition. Tibetan manuals of notation are mnemonic devices and do not give clear-cut instructions like most Western music notation. These notational systems can only be used by those knowing the oral tradition. Various forms of notation, particular to Tibet, can be found for voice, drums and cymbals, and aerophones, or instruments that are blown into to produce sound, like trumpets. The recitation of lines of text occurs through the use of psalmody and brief melodies. One form of chant, dbang, is slow and somber, in which syllables are interspersed between lines of text, and dbangs change with each ritual. Individual monasteries often have a particular sound created by the chant produced by their choruses. \n\nThe Lama ChÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶pa is is perhaps the singularly most popular piece of sacred music Central Asia. Many monks and nuns use it as a daily chanting in their meditations; whole monasteries perform it communally on the tenth and twenty-fifth days of every month; and as a practice for special occasions, it is often used as a piece to be chanted at the time of the death of a family member or loved one. Today the Lama ChÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶pa is even more popular than ever, serving as a symbol of the endangered Tibetan civilization.  \n \nTracks in this torrent:\n\n1.Malu Semchen\n2.Dechen Ngang Ley\n3.Namo guru bhayh\n4.Detong Yermey\n5.Puntsok Delek\n6.Gang gi Tukjey\n7.Kyabgon Jetsun\n8.Sazhi Pokyi\n9.Chewa Drakgyai\n10.Tokmey Du Ney\n11.Yonten Jungney\n12.Khyo Ni Lama\n13.Detar Lansum\n14.Tashi Tsigchey\n\nThank you Buddhatorrents\n\n  \nAccumulate Merit - Keep Sharing!\n\nI am here:\n            &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://suprbay.org/member.php?u=39663&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://suprbay.org/member.php?u=39663&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor more Buddhist Dharma Torrents see:\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se/user/karmapa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se/user/karmapa&lt;/a&gt;\n\n @@  @@                                            \n @@ @@                                             \n @@@@     @@@   @@@  @@@@@@@   @@@   @@@@    @@@   \n @@@        @@  @@ @ @@ @@ @@    @@  @@ @@     @@  \n @@@@     @@@@  @@   @@ @@ @@  @@@@  @@ @@   @@@@  \n @@ @@   @@ @@  @@   @@ @@ @@ @@ @@  @@ @@  @@ @@  \n @@  @@   @@@@  @@   @@ @@ @@  @@@@  @@@@    @@@@  \n                                     @@\n\t\t\t             @@  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea7494eecc89c4e8763040ebe966c50fbbd27125","amp;dn":"Buddhist+Chants+-+Lama+Chopa+-+Tantric+Tibetan+Verse+-+Karmapa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea7494eecc89c4e8763040ebe966c50fbbd27125","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,116,148,238,204,137,196,232,118,48,64,235,233,102,197,15,187,210,113,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
