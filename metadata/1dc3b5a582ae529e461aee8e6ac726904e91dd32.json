The young band from Winnipeg casts a wide net over traditional influences, breathing fresh life into the age-old balladry of &quot;The Wagoner's Lad,&quot; generating a dynamic tension between the soulful depth of Jessica Havey's vocals and Tania Elizabeth's fiddle on a pair of spiritual standards (&quot;Death Came a-Knockin'&quot; and &quot;True Religion&quot;), and keeping the dance floor jumping with their sprightly instrumental medleys. Though the Canadian quintet doesn't feature much original material, they extend their interpretive reach to contemporary songs as well, with the desperate edge of Ruth Ungar's &quot;Four Blue Walls&quot; providing a bracing change of mood, while the bittersweet rendition of Paul Brady's &quot;You and I&quot; (with the songwriter on harmony vocals) carries the musical interplay beyond the traditional realm. (Their attempt at fellow Canadian Leonard Cohen's &quot;Everybody Knows&quot; represents a rare misstep, lacking both the droll humor and the dark fatalism of the original.) Banjo iconoclast BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©la Fleck coproduced the album, championing the Duhks as fellow trailblazers who use traditional elements to create a sound all their own. --Don McLeese \n\ncd ripped bydBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dc3b5a582ae529e461aee8e6ac726904e91dd32","amp;dn":"The+Duhks...The+Duhks%282005%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dc3b5a582ae529e461aee8e6ac726904e91dd32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,195,181,165,130,174,82,158,70,26,238,142,106,199,38,144,78,145,221,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
