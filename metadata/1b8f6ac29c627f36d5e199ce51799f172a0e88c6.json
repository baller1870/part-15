(The same way that later NIN multitracks have worked)\nShame on Macintosh owners for not doing this themselves years ago.\n\n\nI've also included my own simple mix-down and instrumental versions on the tracks, done in garageband and again in Audacity - the result should be more or less the same.\n\n\nAs always, these files are compressed as FLAC.\nIf you haven't worked out FLAC yet: google it.\n\n\nfind more official and unofficial multitracks at  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/nympholept&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/nympholept&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ninremixes.com/multitracks.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ninremixes.com/multitracks.php&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b8f6ac29c627f36d5e199ce51799f172a0e88c6","amp;dn":"Nine+Inch+Nails+-+The+Hand+That+Feeds+%28full+length+multitracks%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b8f6ac29c627f36d5e199ce51799f172a0e88c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,143,106,194,156,98,127,54,213,225,153,206,81,121,159,23,42,14,136,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
