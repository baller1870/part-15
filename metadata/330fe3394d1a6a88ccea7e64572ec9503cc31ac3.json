The Atlanta band entered Architekt Studios in Butler, NJ to record their highly anticipated and much-talked-about acoustic studio album. It will be a collection of 2014 songs, along with re-recorded Sevendust classics. Newly re-recorded songs will include: &quot;Black,&quot; &quot;Gone,&quot; &quot;Denial,&quot; &quot;Karma,&quot; &quot;Trust,&quot; and &quot;Crucified.&quot; Six new songs for 2014 have also been written and recorded for the acoustic album. \n\n \tSong Title \tTime \t\n\t  1.
