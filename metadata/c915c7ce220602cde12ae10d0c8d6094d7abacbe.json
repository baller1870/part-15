For Ellen Aim's singing voice, he combined the voices of Laurie Sargent and Holly Sherwood. The Attackers were the real-life (Face to Face) bandmates of Sargent, who provided the lead vocals on Ellen Aim's songs &quot;Never Be You&quot; and &quot;Sorcerer&quot; and supporting vocals on &quot;Tonight Is What It Means To Be Young.&quot; The version of 'Sorcerer' on the actual soundtrack album was performed by Marilyn Martin (written by Stevie Nicks).\n\nTwo Wagnerian rock songs written by Jim Steinman were part of the soundtrack: &quot;Tonight Is What It Means To Be Young&quot; and &quot;Nowhere Fast,&quot; both performed by Fire Inc. with Holly Sherwood as lead vocal. The title of the former was used as the tagline on some promotional materials for the film. Dan Hartman's &quot;I Can Dream About You&quot; is the most successful song from this movie and became a Billboard top 10 hit in 1984. In the movie, the song is performed by &quot;the Sorels,&quot; a fictional doo-wop style group consisting of actors Stoney Jackson, Grand L. Bush, Mykelti Williamson, and Robert Townsend.[2] However, the song was actually sung by Winston Ford, whose vocals were convincingly lip-synced by Stoney Jackson in the movie. There are thus two versions of the song, but the most popular was sung by Dan Hartman for commercial release.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.filez.st/screenshots/02/169336102Streets_of_Fire_1984Soundtrack.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.filez.st/screenshots/02/169336102Streets_of_Fire_1984Soundtrack.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n1. \tNowhere Fast \n2. \tSorcerer \t\n3. \tDeeper and Deeper\n4. \tCountdown to Love \n5. \tNever be You \t\n6. \tI Can Dream About You \n7. \tHold That Snake \n8. \tBlue Shadows ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c915c7ce220602cde12ae10d0c8d6094d7abacbe","amp;dn":"Streets+of+Fire+-+OST+%5BMp3+320+kbps%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c915c7ce220602cde12ae10d0c8d6094d7abacbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,21,199,206,34,6,2,205,225,42,225,13,12,141,96,148,215,171,172,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
