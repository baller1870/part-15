(voice)\n\nDescription: In this 20-minute film, Jean Marie-Straub, who was born in Metz, Lorraine, unfolds the changing history of his homeland, a country torn by different wars and states. Victories are defeats and vice versa, and the land is saturated with iron, coal and blood. &quot;Lothringen!&quot; (&quot;Lorraine&quot;) is Straub's personal account of &quot;How Green was my Valley&quot;, a lesson in topographical land survey and history.\n\nHorizontal axes anchor the images in almost every frame: horizons, borders, lines of confluence between rivers, roads, villages, valleys, distant mountains, the sky, just as vertical structures emerge and announce their materiality: trees, lamp posts, statues, bodies. And the wind that blows through the landscape, as resisting and absolute as the voices of the two characters,\n\nThe 'narrative' in the film existing outside the panoramic shots of the countryside, captured in spectacular slow pans in either direction that recall their earlier &quot;Too Early, Too Late&quot;; the spectacle, the surprise of discovery through sight and sound are as potent here as in any other Straub-Huillet film.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2326fb64bd7084ea65284c6029cd212f69461a7e","amp;dn":"Lothringen+%281994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2326fb64bd7084ea65284c6029cd212f69461a7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,38,251,100,189,112,132,234,101,40,76,96,41,205,33,47,105,70,26,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
