Its main theme is the transformation of the political configuration of the state and the establishment of the Roman Empire. Chapters 1-6 supply a political narrative history of the period. In chapters 7-12 the institutions of government are described and analysed. Chapters 13-14 offer a survey of the Roman world in this period region by region, and chapters 15-21 deal with the most important social and cultural developments of the era (the city of Rome, the structure of society, art, literature, and law). Central to the period is the achievement of the first emperor, Augustus.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1be097e96b3119ae258af2425ebf07ca5ff521f2","amp;dn":"The+Cambridge+Ancient+History+Vol+10+-+The+Augustan+Empire%2C+43+B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1be097e96b3119ae258af2425ebf07ca5ff521f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,224,151,233,107,49,25,174,37,138,242,66,94,191,7,202,95,245,33,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
