It was eclipsed by &quot;U Will Know&quot; the Black Men United collaboration, but &quot;Freedom&quot; was better. It truly brought together black female artists beyond the obvious genres of rap and R&amp;B including such as the always vibrant Me'Shell NdegeOcello. Besides its anthem like qualities (&quot;Freedom for my body, Freedom for my mind&quot;), the song itself is amazing with its beats, lyrics, and harmonies. It could easily have become a confusing mess of showboating but it didn't --I highly recommend this album.[/quote]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a30db8cfac0c8e96eb164a62ca17df7a2be9cf81","amp;dn":"Panther+-+The+Original+Motion+Picture+Soundtrack+320cbr+%28Big+Pap","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a30db8cfac0c8e96eb164a62ca17df7a2be9cf81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,13,184,207,172,12,142,150,235,22,74,98,202,23,223,122,43,233,207,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
