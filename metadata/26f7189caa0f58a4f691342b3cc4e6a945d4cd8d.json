Under the shadow of centuries old so called dialogue between Byzantine emperor Manuel II Paleologus and an educated Persian, on the subject of Christianity and Islam, and the truth of both. In the selection of a very small segment of the dialogue Pope made target to the Holy Prophet of Islam.\nHe might be testing the patience of the Muslims, but in reality he not only ruined, the years long efforts of his predecessor in moments but also he exposed himself to the entire world, where he stands. In the citation of discourse of the emperor he said, &quot;Show me just what Mohammed brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached&quot; .\nIn this way, the Pope leveled false accusations against the Holy Prophet of Islam under the shelter of so called dialogue between Byzantine emperor Manuel II Paleologus and a Persian scholar. This statement was astonishing for the whole world in general and particular for the Muslims.\nBy attributing these wrong matters to the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be on him) and the Holy QurÃ¢â‚¬â„¢an on one hand the feelings of Muslims have been trifled with. Secondly, by way of reaction those Muslims who have no control over their emotions may take improper actions that would give the others further propaganda opportunity against the Muslims.\nIn addition, it would further increase hatred for the Muslims in the hearts of the followers of the Pope and the people of the West who consider Islam to be an extremist religion. May Allah the Exalted have mercy and save the world from evil and disorder.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFollowing is the location where Jesus is buried.\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Rozabal/@34.094209,74.816296,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x44fae1e270113ec6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Rozabal/@34.094209,74.816296,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x44fae1e270113ec6&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAn Overview of The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community:\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is a dynamic, fast growing international revival movement within Islam.
