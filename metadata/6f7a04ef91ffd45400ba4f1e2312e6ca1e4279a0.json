It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 14, 2010. In the episode, all celebrities who have been mocked by residents of South Park plan to file a class action lawsuit against the town. Tom Cruise promises to end the lawsuit if the town can produce the Muslim prophet Muhammad.\n\nThe episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States and TV-14 in Canada. To celebrate their landmark episode, Parker and fellow series co-creator Matt Stone decided to write a new episode combining many of South Park's past story lines and controversies. The Muhammad subplot, similar to one previously featured the tenth season episode &quot;Cartoon Wars&quot;, refers to Comedy Central's past refusal to allow images of Muhammad to be shown on the network following controversies 2005 and 2007 in cartoons in European newspapers resulted in riots and threats.\n\n&quot;200&quot; includes many celebrities that have been mocked in previous episodes, including Cruise, Rob Reiner, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and Mel Gibson. The episode also involves a subplot in which Cartman learns he may not know the true identity of his father. It was said in the second season episode &quot;Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut&quot; that his intersexual mother is his father, but the events of &quot;200&quot; and the subsequent episode reveal that this was not the case.\n\n&quot;200&quot; received mostly positive reviews. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by 3.33 million viewers, making it the most watched cable television program of the night. Within a week of the episode's original broadcast date, the website for the radical Muslim organization Revolution Muslim posted an entry warning Parker and Stone they risked getting murdered for airing the episode. Although the site insisted the entry was a warning, several media outlets and observers interpreted it as a threat. As a result, Comedy Central heavily censored portions of the sequel episode, &quot;201&quot;, by removing images and references to Muhammad.\n\n\n\nKillerbunny Digital Media and Torrents 2010\n\nWere Baaaaaack !!!\n\n\n\nTracker listhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce\nudp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\nudp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.istole.it:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.istole.it:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\nudp://tracker.istole.it:80/announce &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.thepiratebay.se/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.thepiratebay.se/announce&lt;/a&gt;\nudp://tracker.thepiratebay.se:80/announce &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\nudp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f7a04ef91ffd45400ba4f1e2312e6ca1e4279a0","amp;dn":"SouthPark+Episode+200+%28Part+1+%26+2%29+Killerbunny+Digital.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f7a04ef91ffd45400ba4f1e2312e6ca1e4279a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,122,4,239,145,255,212,84,0,186,79,30,35,18,230,202,30,66,121,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
