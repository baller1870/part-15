Tris Prior makes a choice that surprises everyone. Then Tris and her fellow faction-members have to live through a highly competitive initiation process to live out the choice they have made. They must undergo extreme physical and intense psychological tests, that transform them all. But Tris has a secret that she is Divergent, which means she doesn't fit into any one group. If anyone knew, it would mean a certain death. As she discovers a growing conflict that threatens to unravel her seemingly perfect society, this secret might help her save the people she loves... or it might destroy her.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0389c304134a188c643241bb04174f292960319","amp;dn":"Divergent+2014+%26lt%3Btj_h4xor%26gt%3B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0389c304134a188c643241bb04174f292960319","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,56,156,48,65,52,161,136,198,67,36,27,176,65,116,242,146,150,3,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
