This report identifies 11 key questions that have a good chance to be answered in the next decade. It urges that a new research strategy be created that brings to bear the techniques of both astronomy and sub-atomic physics in a cross-disciplinary way to address these questions. The report presents seven recommendations to facilitate the necessary research and development coordination. These recommendations identify key priorities for future scientific projects critical for realizing these scientific opportunities.\n\nContents\n\nFront Matter\nPreface\nAcknowledgment of Reviewers\nDedication\nContents\nExecutive Summary\n1 Introduction: Where We Are and Where We Can Be\n2 Foundations: Matter, Space, and Time\n3 How Are Matter, Space, and Time Unified?\n4 How Did the Universe Get Going?\n5 What Is the Nature of Dark Matter and Dark Energy?\n6 What Are the Limits of Physical Law?\n7 Realizing the Opportunities\nA Meeting Agendas\nB Call for Community Input\nC Project Proposals Received (Listed Chronologically)\nD Glossary and Acronyms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:191e0a35e47fcf3e0de8211204163dca7de22bb4","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2003%5D+Connecting+quarks+with+the+cosmos+eleven+science+qu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"191e0a35e47fcf3e0de8211204163dca7de22bb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,30,10,53,228,127,207,62,13,232,33,18,4,22,61,202,125,226,43,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
