Not only is there a\n       new PFI, but the new Video data is larger than previous Waves.\n\n       The current v2.9.0 build 421 of Xbox Backup Creator does not properly\n       deal with the larger video when building the ISO, so all components\n       (game data, video, PFI, DMI, and SS) had to be ripped individually\n       and rebuilt into a proper (verified) ISO with abgx360.\n\n       Xbox Backup Creator's author, Redline99, has been notified and a new\n       build will be released soon to address the issue.\n\n    ____________________________________________________________________ _ _\n   +-GREETiNGS.AND.RESPECT\n\n       COMPLEX  VIMTO  LOUNGE\n\n   ________________________________________________________________________\n   ++   RRoD - Right when you least expect it!           ++----------------'\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76d3e9376cf8cb440a26e8a675e26cec6b95a3da","amp;dn":"Power_Rangers_Super_Samurai_READNFO_NTSC-XBOX360-RRoD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76d3e9376cf8cb440a26e8a675e26cec6b95a3da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,211,233,55,108,248,203,68,10,38,232,166,117,226,108,236,107,149,163,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
