It is however still a very good film.\n\nThe story is centres on Cabbar horse-cab driver with a large family, growing\ndebts and a loterey ticket habit to support. Already barely getting by, his life begins to uterly collapse after one of his horses is killed by a car.\n\nWith-out enough money to both cover his debts and buy a new horse Cabbar is increasingly tempted by the treasure-hunting plans of his rougish best friend.\n\nAn English .srt subtitle file is included.\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: Umut - Yilmaz GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ney.avi\nFilesize.....: 690 MB (or 707,110 KB or 724,080,640 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:39:02 (148,546 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 847 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 120 kb/s (60/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.90.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°\nFrame Size...: 512x384 (1.33:1) [=4:3]\n\n\n\nI have formatted it to fit nicely in most other websites and message boards:\n\n********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
