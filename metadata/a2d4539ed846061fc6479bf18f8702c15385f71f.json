Aldrig tidigare har sÃƒÂ¥ barnsligt vackra melodier framfÃƒÂ¶rts av en sÃƒÂ¥ till synes undermÃƒÂ¥lig blÃƒÂ¥sorkester, aldrig tidigare har heller Maher lÃƒÂ¥tit sÃƒÂ¥ fullÃƒÂ¤ndat och sjÃƒÂ¤lvklart mahersk som nÃƒÂ¤r nÃƒÂ¥gon annan dikterar villkoren. PÃƒÂ¥ Osaka bridge agerar Wells Gil Evans till Tori Kudos Miles Davis och nÃƒÂ¤r hans klarinett i Banned announcements planlÃƒÂ¶st flyger rakt in i solen fÃƒÂ¥ngar de sjÃƒÂ¤lva kÃƒÂ¤rnan i det som kallas maherism.&quot;\n / Andres Lokko, SvD\n\n&quot;Osaka Bridge comes on at times like a school band, and at times like hotel cabaret. Maher Shalal Hash Baz are a best selling Japanese big band, with brass and string sections to boot, and Bill Wells is well known as an indie-jazz stalwart, having clocked up releases on Domino and Geographic.\n\nAt first glance the coupling seems odd, like chalk and cheese, with Maher Shalal Hash Baz die-hards asking questions as to the professional direction of their favourite amateur band. However, Wells slots in inconspicuously within the whole ensemble, indulging in the excitement of playing instead of the technicalities of composing.\n\nOsaka Bridge is full of youthful optimism, with broken pop jangles played alongside splashes of classic jazz tones. Duck is fantastic, with the brass section joyfully oblivious to bum notes and missed cues. Tipsy Cat is aptly titled, with an endearing rolling rhythm over uplifting wind sections.\n\nThe central tenet of Osaka Bridge seems to be in principles, not in the precision or skill of it&amp;#039;s musicians. The naivety we are faced with lifts the album, giving it an angular and cluttered feel, but an image of smiling faces too, as if their parents were watching for the first time.&quot;\n / angryape.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2d4539ed846061fc6479bf18f8702c15385f71f","amp;dn":"Bill+Wells+%26+Maher+Shalal+Hash+Baz+-+Osaka+Bridge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2d4539ed846061fc6479bf18f8702c15385f71f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,212,83,158,216,70,6,31,198,71,155,241,143,135,2,193,83,133,247,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
