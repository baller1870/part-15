Life is lonely for Kasienka. At home her mother's heart is breaking and at school friends are scarce. But when someone special swims into her life, Kasienka learns that there might be more than one way for her to stay afloat. &quot;The Weight of Water&quot; is a startlingly original piece of fiction; most simply a brilliant coming of age story, it also tackles the alienation experienced by many young immigrants. Moving, unsentimental and utterly page-turning, we meet and share the experiences of a remarkable girl who shows us how quiet courage prevails.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7df54310084b8b4ab8b501d162a9120bea5195d","amp;dn":"The+Weight+of+Water+-+Sarah+Crossan.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7df54310084b8b4ab8b501d162a9120bea5195d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,223,84,49,0,132,184,180,171,139,80,29,22,42,145,32,190,165,25,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
