But what does it demand of those who embrace it? Or, as he says, &quot;If you believe ... what are you going to do about it?&quot; That's the core question in the next film from the producers of 2014's Christian-movie hit God's Not Dead.\n\nMatt's the first to wrestle with that question in this ensemble drama that weaves together the stories of more than a dozen charactersÃ¢â‚¬â€some of whom are already believers in Christ, some who aren't there yet.\n\nOn his way home one night, Matt has a serendipitous encounter with a witness named Malachi who's shouldering a life-sized cross through Chicago, preaching the gospel to anyone who'll listen. &quot;Do you believe in the cross of Christ?&quot; Malachi asks Matt at a stop sign. &quot;I'm a pastor,&quot; Matt replies. &quot;You didn't answer the question,&quot; Malachi counters.\n\nTheir conversation is interrupted by shattering glass as four toughs steal a van. Malachi confronts them, prompting their leaderÃ¢â‚¬â€a gangbanger named KriminalÃ¢â‚¬â€to put a gun to Malachi's head and ask if he's ready to die. &quot;I'm ready,&quot; Malachi responds unflinchingly. &quot;Are you?&quot;\n\nThat fearless act of faith is the first domino in a chain of events that ultimately influences everyone in the film.\n\nMatt's convicted by Malachi's spiritual fortitude, so much so that he decides to help a pregnant, homeless teen he sees rummaging in a dumpster. Matt's wife, Grace, isn't happy about him bringing the girl home, so they agree to put young Maggie up in a hotel ... and agonize over what their responsibility to her is. We then see Grace's frustration give way to compassion as the older, infertile woman helps the desperate younger one during the final weeks of her pregnancy.\n\nMeanwhile, someone else's conscience has been pricked by Malachi's witness: Kriminal's younger brother, Percy. As Kriminal and his crew plot a hit on a rival gang, seeds of faith take root in Percy's heart ... and begin to change his values.\n\nFrom there one plot point after another jumps into the raging stream of interlocking coincidences.\n\nOtherwise known as providence.\n\nJ.D. and Terri, retired members of Matt's church, have grappled for years with the loss of their daughter to a drunk driver. A second sermon from Matt about the cross spurs them to relinquish their grief and take action, opening their doors to a homeless woman named Samantha and her young daughter, Lily, who've struggled since the death of Samantha's husband.\n\nThe janitor at the church (who Samantha and Lily meet in the emergency room of a local hospital) goes out of his way to offer hospitality to the down-on-their-luck mom and daughter ... never mind that Joe's &quot;luck&quot; has hardly been any better","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2a447acccf3d39b158bf270ed2e14b219f37870","amp;dn":"The+Bible+Series+-+Do+You+Believe+-+2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2a447acccf3d39b158bf270ed2e14b219f37870","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,164,71,172,204,243,211,155,21,139,242,112,237,46,20,178,25,243,120,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
