This original Handbook aims to take stock and questions what the future of EU copyright should be. What went wrong with the harmonisation acquis? What did the directives do well? Should copyright be further harmonised? Each of the 25 recognised copyright experts from different European countries gives a critical account of the EU harmonisation carried out on several aspects of copyright law (subject-matter, originality, duration, rights, and defences etc.), and asks whether further harmonisation is desirable or not.This way, the Handbook not only gives guidance to European institutions as to what remains to be done or needs to be remedied but is also the first overall picture of current and future EU copyright law. This Handbook will be of great interest to academics and intellectual property lawyers, as well general commercial lawyers, all over Europe because it reviews European directives in the field of copyright and also the relationships between copyright and other laws. Policymakers will also find much to interest them in the discussions regarding the future of EU copyright law and the proposed amendments to the existing legal framework.\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nEdited by Estelle Derclaye, Associate Professor and Reader in Intellectual Property Law, University of Nottingham, UK.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51e776768bf7167ae8531d3d13eb837a16b698b9","amp;dn":"Estelle+Derclaye+-+Research+Handbook+on+the+Future+of+EU+Copyrig","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51e776768bf7167ae8531d3d13eb837a16b698b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,231,118,118,139,247,22,122,232,83,29,61,19,235,131,122,22,182,152,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
