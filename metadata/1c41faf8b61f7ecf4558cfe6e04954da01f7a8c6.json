It is an original CD rip using the latest error-proof software in the highest quality available today. Know your pirates. Older rips can be lower quality and some pirates transcode, making so-called quality rips using old error low quality as source. They are faking you out just to make their uploads popular.

This is what put Metallica into the mainstream, and it is indeed a masterpeice. Every song on this on is a classic. The talent is all there. The production is crystal clear. Everything about this album is epic. A lot of people complain that this is all a little too mainstream, but I disagree. I believe the boys to be in top performance, just because it's a little more accessible, doesn't mean that the talent is gone. Kirk plays some of his greatest solos on this album. I believe that everyone is in top form. Jason Newsted also gets a chance to prove himself on this one. As a bassist, I believe his basslines on the slower songs to showcase his talent the most. He packs a lot of emotion, especially in Nothing Else Matters. Overall, this is just a fun and enjoyable cd with talented musicians and songwriting. Highly recommended!\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nMetallica - Metallica\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Metallica\nAlbum................: Metallica\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1991 08\n\nFLAC\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 69 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Best Quality Available For MP3)\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 257kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
