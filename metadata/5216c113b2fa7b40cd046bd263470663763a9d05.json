It examines links between theme, genre, and visual style, and looks at the ways in which a range of styles and traditions has extended across different historical periods and political regimes. Czech and Slovak Cinema provides a unique study of areas of Central European film history that have not previously been examined in English.\n\nPublisher: Edinburgh University Press; Reprint edition (August 9, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0748620826\nISBN-13: 978-0748620821\n\nEditorial Reviews\nReview\n\nCzech and Slovak Cinema is an invaluable introduction for the novice as well as an extremely useful reference book for advanced research in the area. Hames offers not only a well-balanced overview of important themes, styles, and personalities in Czech and Slovak fi lm but does so in a spirit of good-humored critique that never mistakes hagiography for history or description for analysis.\n(David Sorfa Slavic Review)\nAbout the Author\n\nPeter Hames is Honorary Research Associate in Film and Media Studies at the Staffordshire University","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5216c113b2fa7b40cd046bd263470663763a9d05","amp;dn":"Czech+and+Slovak+Cinema+Theme+and+Tradition%28pdf%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5216c113b2fa7b40cd046bd263470663763a9d05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,22,193,19,178,250,123,64,205,4,107,210,99,71,6,99,118,58,157,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
