My imagination conjures up demons of the worst kind.\n\nReality is much worse:\n\nA collar with no leash. A prison with no walls. And a life stripped of meaning.\n\nI am presented with a vile contract and asked to sign. It outlines the terms of my servitude. The only information I have about my captor are the two small letters inked at the bottom:\n\nJ.S.\n\nArmed with only my memories, I must do everything I can to avoid becoming ensnared in his twisted mind games. But in the end, it all comes down to one choice:\n\nResist and die.\n\nOr submit, and sign my life away.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04379b6d91c81a2426b30a0ea93f8092ad70b58b","amp;dn":"Uncovering+You+-+The+Contract+%28Uncovering+You+%231%29+Scarlett+Edwar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04379b6d91c81a2426b30a0ea93f8092ad70b58b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,55,155,109,145,200,26,36,38,179,10,14,169,63,128,146,173,112,181,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
