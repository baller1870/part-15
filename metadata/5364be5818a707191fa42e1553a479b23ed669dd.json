Dear's vocals are at their most expressive, imposing, and sinister. If kept to an inaudible volume, they could be used in a slasher flick as the mutterings of an obscene phone caller. When heard as clearly as possible, certain couplets, like the one that forms the teenage wildlife chorus within the burbling &quot;Headcage,&quot; leave an immediate impression but are sufficiently creepy no matter their harmless meaning. Despite the increased use of traditional instrumentation - and the fact that some of the songs would be more suited for avant-rock playlists than DJ sets - Beams is not worlds away from 2010's equally fascinating Black City. Dear's music still sounds as if it was recorded with cutting-edge means in a squalid bunker beneath scuzzy, terminally damp streets.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5364be5818a707191fa42e1553a479b23ed669dd","amp;dn":"Matthew+Dear+-+Beams+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5364be5818a707191fa42e1553a479b23ed669dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,100,190,88,24,167,7,25,31,164,46,21,83,164,121,178,62,214,105,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
