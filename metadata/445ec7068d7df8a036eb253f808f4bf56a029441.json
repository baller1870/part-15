Release: 1999.\n\n\nBear Family's second Waylon Jennings box set covers the late '60s and early '70s, tracing Waylon's journey to outlaw country. Often, it's possible to hear him floundering as he tries to find the perfect balance between rock and country, sometimes flailing about admirably, other times feeling a little out of place. Still, this remains essential for any serious Jennings or country music fan. Even when Waylon wasn't quite sure of what he was doing, he made extraordinary music, from the wah-wah-inflected cover of &quot;Lonely Weekends&quot; to the undeniable brilliance of his Honky Tonk Heroes material. Six Strings Away is a travelogue of Waylon finding his voice -- and the remarkable thing is, not only does it deliver some of the greatest country music of all time, but it winds up mirroring the evolution of the genre during those years.
