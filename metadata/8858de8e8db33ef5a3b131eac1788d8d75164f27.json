Bored with their single existence,\nPongo arranges for Roger to meet Anita, a pretty young woman who just happens to\nhave a female Dalmatian named Perdita. It is not long before love blossoms all\naround and a double wedding takes place. A few months later, Perdita gives birth\nto 15 puppies, much to the delight of Cruella De Vil, a wealthy, wicked former\nschoolmate of Anita's whose burning passion is to own a coat made of Dalmatian\npelts. When she is unable to purchase the puppies, she has them dognapped and\nbrought to her crumbling estate in the country, where 84 other Dalmatians are\nalso being held captive. All attempts by the police to find the missing pups\nfail, and the desperate Pongo and Perdita appeal to the dogs of London, via the\ntwilight bark. Led by The Colonel, an indomitable shaggy dog and a cat named\nSergeant Tibbs, all dogdom comes to the rescue and, aided by geese, cows, and\nhorses, tracks down the missing puppies.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Rod Taylor.\n=&gt;-Betty Lou Gerson.\n=&gt;-J Pat O'Malley.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Clyde Geronimi.\n\n101 Dalmatians II Patchs London Adventure.\nRoger, Anita and their canine clan are packing for the big move to Dalmatian\nPlantation, a home in the country with plenty of room for the 101 pups and far\nfrom the clutches of Cruella DeVil. The feistiest pup, Patch, feels lost in a\nsea of spots and longs to be a one-of-a-kind wonderdog like his TV hero,\nThunderbolt. While watching the Thunderbolt Adventure Hour, Patch hears\nabout a chance to appear on the show while it's filming in London. However,\nthe family move will interfere with Patch's opportunity - until he's\naccidentally left behind in the commotion. Patch heads for the audition to\nmeet his hero. Meanwhile, Thunderbolt's &quot;trusty&quot; sidekick, Lightning, reveals\nthat the producers of the show want to replace Thunderbolt with a younger dog.\nIn order to save his job, Thunderbolt decides he will go into the real world\nand perform an act of true heroism to prove himself. A veritable reference\nbook to Thunderbolt's many adventures, Patch provides the perfect guide for\nthe TV star in his attempts at real-life heroics. As for Cruella DeVil - she's\nback and more obsessed with Dalmatians than ever. At first, she's able to calm\nher frenzy through an affiliation with a spot-fixated artist.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Barry Bostwick.\n=&gt;-Jason Alexander.\n=&gt;-Martin Short.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Jim Kammerud.\n\nInfo\n=&gt;-Genre.....................: Animation : Adventure : Family.\n=&gt;-Release Date..............: 1961 : 2003.\n=&gt;-Language..................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size.................: 947 MiB : 867 MiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate..........: 1 672 Kbps : 1 649 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime.............: 1h 19mn : 1h 13mn.\n\nVideo\n=&gt;-Codec.....................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio..............: 4:3 : 16:9.\n=&gt;-Resolution................: 1280 x 940 : 1280 x 720.\n=&gt;-Bit rate..................: 1500 Kbps.\n\nAudio English\n=&gt;-Codec.....................: mp4a : MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels..................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate..................: 152 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate..........: 192 Kbps.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8858de8e8db33ef5a3b131eac1788d8d75164f27","amp;dn":"101+Dalmatians+1%2C+2+-+Duology+Animation+Eng+720p+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8858de8e8db33ef5a3b131eac1788d8d75164f27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,88,222,142,141,179,62,245,163,177,49,234,193,120,141,141,117,22,79,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
