It was a radical departure from their previous album, Argus, containing almost none of the twin-lead guitar harmonies and folk elements that featured in the previous album. Though Wishbone Four was popular among fans upon its release, sales paled in comparison to Argus, and founding member Ted Turner would leave the band after the subsequent tour.\n\n Track listing\nAll songs composed by Andy Powell, Martin Turner, Ted Turner and Steve Upton\n\n&quot;So Many Things to Say&quot; \n&quot;Ballad of the Beacon&quot; \n&quot;No Easy Road&quot; \n&quot;Everybody Needs a Friend&quot; \n&quot;Doctor&quot; \n&quot;Sorrel&quot; \n&quot;Sing Out the Song&quot; \n&quot;Rock 'n Roll Widow&quot; \n\n\n Personnel\nMartin Turner - bass, vocals \nAndy Powell - guitar, vocals \nTed Turner - guitar, vocals \nSteve Upton - drums \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a959e056a28da12ddf60398bd9d215bfe266491","amp;dn":"Wishbone+Ash...Wishbone+Four%281973%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a959e056a28da12ddf60398bd9d215bfe266491","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,149,158,5,106,40,218,18,221,246,3,152,189,157,33,91,254,38,100,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
