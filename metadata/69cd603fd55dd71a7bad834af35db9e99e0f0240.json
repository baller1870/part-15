It worked so well the first time, Capcom has brought STREET FIGHTER EX back for another run. Only Kairi and Sakura return from the first installment of the series, and fighters like Volcano Rosso, Nanase, Area, and Sharon have taken the places of the departed. The format of the STREET FIGHTER EX games is very close to that of the original STREET FIGHTER 2 dynasty. You choose a combatant, and then try to fight your way past all of your opponents using only your hands and the element of surprise. You'll face each opponent until one of you has won two out of three fights. There are several new modes of play in this version, including the stellar Director mode, which allows you to conceive and edit a film of your warrior. The films can then be stored on memory cards and shown to friends later on. Packed with awesome combo attacks, incredible 3D graphics, dynamic characters, and beautifully rendered settings, STREET FIGHTER EX 2 PLUS is simply not to be missed.\n\nFeatures:\n\nNew fighters; a Director mode; 3D arenas; tons of combos; two-player action\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69cd603fd55dd71a7bad834af35db9e99e0f0240","amp;dn":"Street+Fighter+EX2+Plus+PSX+NTSC-U","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69cd603fd55dd71a7bad834af35db9e99e0f0240","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,205,96,63,213,93,215,26,123,173,131,74,243,93,185,233,158,15,2,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
