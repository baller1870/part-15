Again the movie never got synchronised so its in original french with hard english subs. I didnt do it it was like that on the DVD. I hope you enjoy the movie as much as The Piano Teacher, and look forward to my next Haneke encode , the original version of Funny Games in german with hard english subs.Now follows the traditional IMDB review*********\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Unknown Code: Incomplete Tales of Several Journeys (Code inconnu: RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cit incomplet de divers voyages)&quot; is a fascinating exploration of communication, using all the elements of film to create a trompe l&amp;#039;oeil of sight, sound and character interactions.\n\nWe see extended vignettes of people tangentially related through an accidental intersection in Paris. In a brief interview on the Sundance Channel, where I viewed the film, writer/director Michael Haneke said he specifically selected Paris because it is one of the few European cities whose multiculturalism is so visible. We see here how it attracts immigrants not only as traditionally from the rural countryside, but now from Eastern Europe and Africa.\n\nThough not as violent as the incidents in &quot;Amores perros&quot;, released the same year, or the later &quot;Crash,&quot; the unsettling confrontation influences the characters&amp;#039; perceptions, of each other and of authority figures. We see them made sensitive to how people look, how people talk to each other, the sounds they make, and, even more importantly, shades how they interact. We see how differently people communicate with their own families, with their friends, their parents, their children, their colleagues, their lovers or their advisers, particularly through simple life cycle events.\n\nSometimes Michael Haneke toys with us, as the camera moves back and reveals that a poignant situation isn&amp;#039;t as dire as we thought, particularly playing on the terrific Juliette Binoche&amp;#039;s well-known image as a beautiful actress (and yes, she does look beautiful even standing around in lingerie ironing while watching TV). Or he plays ironic tricks ÃƒÂ¢?? having deaf kids do emotional charades or perform in a marching drum band or creating ambiguity about a door entry code to reinforce a theme of restless homelessness. We see lovers who communicate passionately without words, in one lovely scene even without touching. (I wonder if this scene with these two inspired a related scene in Rodrigo GarcÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­a&amp;#039;s recent &quot;Nine Lives.&quot;)\n\nOne key character is a self-righteous photojournalist (really stereotypically portrayed by bearded, hunky, disheveled Thierry Neuvic in a multi-pocketed vest with an ever-present camera around his neck) documenting ethnic cleansing in Kosovo or taking candid portraits of unaware subway passengers. But he is helpless at assisting his rebellious teen brother or sullen farmer father or estranged young son. Issues of responsibility to neighbors and passersby is viscerally shown to be not the extreme goal of stopping genocide, but rather providing dignity to a fellow human being or simply listening to what&amp;#039;s happening next door and acting on it.\n\nHaneke provides sympathetic insight into the inner lives of African immigrants, with an ear to how happenings look different to Western rationalists than to those used to revelations of divine and interpretive meanings, particularly in dreams, or sense of time.\n\nBut while he is very sympathetic to the pushes and pulls of immigration that change people&amp;#039;s place in society from matriarch to &quot;the gypsy&quot; as the universal &quot;other&quot; who everyone higher up in society puts down, the family scenes in the Romanian village are more stereotyped, with ethnic wedding dancing.\n\nHaneke&amp;#039;s disarmingly passive style, with almost no music or cinematic affectations (he even mocks his Dogme-style use of sound by showing actors in the film-within-a-film re-dubbing dialog lost to a passing airplane) does make us feel like voyeurs, with each vignette constructed in a single take. In the filmed interview he said the key opening scene took 32 takes before he was satisfied.\n\n\n\nENJOY\n\nLGLuX","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc68ea368b8290596d85784794de232819910abd","amp;dn":"Code.Unknown.DVDRip-LGLuX.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc68ea368b8290596d85784794de232819910abd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,104,234,54,139,130,144,89,109,133,120,71,148,222,35,40,25,145,10,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
