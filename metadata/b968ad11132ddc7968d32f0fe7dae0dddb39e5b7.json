Tro \r\nFormat: PDF \r\nHardcover: 1140 pages \r\nPublisher: Prentice Hall; 1 edition (January 13, 2014) \r\nLanguage: English \r\nISBN: 9780321834683 \r\n\r\n\r\nBestselling author Niva Tro has always believed â€œthe behavior of matter is determined by the properties of molecules and atomsâ€ to be the most important discovery in scientific knowledge. This idea is the entire factor for his seminal new textâ€” Chemistry: Structure and Properties. Dr. Tro emphasizes the relationship between structure and properties, establishes a unique approach to teaching chemistry by presenting atomic and bonding theories early in the text, and stresses key themes throughout. The book is organized to present chemistry as a logical, cohesive story from the microscopic to the macroscopic, so students can fully grasp the theories and framework behind the chemical facts. Every topic has been carefully crafted to convey to students that the relationship between structure and properties is the thread that weaves all of chemistry together.\r\n\r\nWhile developed independently of other Tro texts, Chemistry: Structure and Properties incorporates the authorâ€™s vivid writing style, chemical rigor, dynamic multi-level images, and tested features. His consistent conceptual focus and step-by-step problem-solving framework encourages you to think through processes rather than simply memorize content","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b968ad11132ddc7968d32f0fe7dae0dddb39e5b7","amp;dn":"Chemistry%3A+Structure+and+Properties+%5B2015%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b968ad11132ddc7968d32f0fe7dae0dddb39e5b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,104,173,17,19,45,220,121,104,211,47,15,231,218,224,221,219,57,229,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
