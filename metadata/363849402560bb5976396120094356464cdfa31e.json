His reputation as a great British commander was cemented by his tactical knowledge, ability to get on with foreign allies and care for the common soldier. Churchill always wanted to be on the winning side. He deserted James II to support Dutch prince William of Orange, but was later accused of plotting to restore James to the throne.\r\nJohn Churchill (son of an earlier Sir Winston Churchill) rose to great fame and wealth. He was one of England's greatest Generals who led British and allied armies to important victories over Louis XIV of France. Locations for this film are the magnificent Blenheim Palace that a grateful monarch had built for him and the site of two of his battles, Malplaquet and Blenheim itself.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a8/Great-British-Commanders-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cc/Great-British-Commanders-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/89/Great-British-Commanders-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d2/Great-British-Commanders-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f6/Great-British-Commanders-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/96/Great-British-Commanders-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6e/Great-British-Commanders-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3a/Great-British-Commanders-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a5/Great-British-Commanders-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/25/Great-British-Commanders-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/62/Great-British-Commanders-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cb/Great-British-Commanders-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/51/Great-British-Commanders-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f9/Great-British-Commanders-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4c/Great-British-Commanders-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f2/Great-British-Commanders-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\r\nVideo Bitrate: 2527 kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 720x464\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.552:1\r\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\r\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\r\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\r\nAudio Streams: 2\r\nAudio Languages: english\r\nRunTime Per Part: 23 min\r\nNumber Of Parts: 6\r\nPart Size: 449 MB\r\nRipped by: DocFreak08\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nSource: \nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Great_British_Commanders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:363849402560bb5976396120094356464cdfa31e","amp;dn":"Ch5+Great+British+Commanders+2of6+John+Churchill+1st+Duke+of+Mar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"363849402560bb5976396120094356464cdfa31e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,56,73,64,37,96,187,89,118,57,97,32,9,67,86,70,76,223,163,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
