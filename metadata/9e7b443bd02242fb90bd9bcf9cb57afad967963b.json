After the war, one of the agents returns to find the traitor.

Robert Montgomery's Ride The Pink Horse  (1947, also with Wanda Hendrix) is another example.  I cite this specifically because in Ride The Pink Horse (referring to a merry go round) one of the characters notes that Montgomery (and Alan Ladd in this picture by inference) had a &quot;soldier gun.&quot;  After the &quot;Good War&quot;  GI's were allowed to keep their side arms from the field.  No research has ever been done that I know of which documents real life mayhem caused by this peculiar practice of the US government.\n\nRide The Pink Horse is also recommended.\n\nEnjoy the film.  I watched Captain Carey twice myself.\n\nNotes written January 12th 2013\n\n\n  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e7b443bd02242fb90bd9bcf9cb57afad967963b","amp;dn":"Captain+Carey+USA+%281950%29+starring+Alan+Ladd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e7b443bd02242fb90bd9bcf9cb57afad967963b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,123,68,59,208,34,66,251,144,189,155,207,156,181,122,250,217,103,150,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
