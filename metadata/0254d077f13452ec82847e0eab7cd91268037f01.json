Berylune gives Tyltyl a cap with a diamond setting, and when Tyltyl turns the diamond, the children become aware of and conversant with the souls of a Dog and Cat, as well as of Fire, Water, Bread, Light, and other presumably inanimate things. The troupe thus sets off to find the elusive Blue Bird of Happiness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0254d077f13452ec82847e0eab7cd91268037f01","amp;dn":"The+Blue+Bird+%281918%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0254d077f13452ec82847e0eab7cd91268037f01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,84,208,119,241,52,82,236,130,132,126,14,171,124,217,18,104,3,127,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
