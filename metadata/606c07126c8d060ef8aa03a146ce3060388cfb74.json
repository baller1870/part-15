He may have stopped touring and      \n          releasing new music, but he kept repackaging and reissuing his older albums, striking\n          up an exclusive deal with Wal-Mart highlighted by a second box set called The Limited\n          Series in 2006. That exclusivity contract expired in the summer of 2007, leaving     \n          Brooks a free agent, and he capitalized on his freedom almost immediately, delivering\n          the double-disc singles collection The Ultimate Hits just in time for the holiday    \n          season of 2007. Where previous Garth repackagings could seem a little unnecessary -- \n          it&amp;#039;s not quite clear just how many of his fans needed that second Limited Series     \n          anyway -- The Ultimate Hits actually fills in a needed gap within his catalog, as    \n          Brooks hasn&amp;#039;t had a hit compilation since his first, the 1994 The Hits. That disc was\n          a &quot;limited edition&quot; at least in theory -- there were so many copies pressed it wasn&amp;#039;t\n          exactly rare -- and out of print since the mid-&amp;#039;90s, so it wasn&amp;#039;t available in most  \n          retail stores, plus it didn&amp;#039;t cover all the hits he had between its release and his  \n          retirement. The Ultimate Hits does exactly that, containing all 18 tracks from The   \n          Hits (albeit not in the same sequencing), adding 12 hits that he had in the last half\n          of the &amp;#039;90s, along with four new songs highlighted by a cover of Huey Lewis &amp; the    \n          News&amp;#039; &quot;Workin&amp;#039; for a Livin&amp;#039;.&quot; The new songs are a nice touch, but the real purpose of\n          this set is to offer casual fans a way to get all of Brooks&amp;#039; best-known hits in one  \n          package, and in that regard The Ultimate Hits not only succeeds, it&amp;#039;s long overdue.  \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                 Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,            \n                 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality         \n                 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!                  \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n               Track Listing....:                                                              \n                    CD1                                                                        \n                                                                                               \n                 01.Ain&amp;#039;t going down            [04:34]                                        \n                    (&amp;#039;til the sun comes up)                                                    \n                 02.Friends in low places       [04:19]                                        \n                 03.Shameless                   [04:19]                                        \n                 04.Two of a kind, workin&amp;#039;
