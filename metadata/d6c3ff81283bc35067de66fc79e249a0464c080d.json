The Pope himself couldn&amp;#039;t escape their long shadow and the whispers about a fabulous secret treasure, which was said to include the Holy Grail and the Ark of the Covenant. So who - or what - brought down the mighty Knights Templar? This is the story of an organisation extinct for nearly seven centuries, but whose legacy still echoes through some of today&amp;#039;s &quot;secret societies.&quot; \n\nThe first Templars were French knights dedicated to protecting Christians on pilgrimage to holy sites. Highly trained and passionately devoted to God, they fought with no fear of death and eventually became monks, albeit monks with no problem using a sword on their enemies. \n\nThe Knights built the world&amp;#039;s first multi-national corporation, a huge network of castles, farms and ships all designed to make money to support the Crusades. This financial empire helped Richard the Lionheart and the King of France, butit also raised suspicions that these &quot;holy men&quot; were growing too powerful and independant. Thus began the accusations of heresy - and the burnings at the stake. \n\nProfessor Malcolm Barber, the world&amp;#039;s leading Templar historian, explores the impressive rise and rapid fall of a group ahead of its time. Did the Knights cause the Crusades to ultimately fail? What happened to the surviving heroes of the Order? And - even more important - was there a secret treasure and where might it be now? \n\nTechnical Specs \nVideo Codec: DivX 5.2.1 \nVideo Bitrate: ~1435 kbps; ~0.205 bits/pixel \nVideo Resolution: 560x416 (1.35:1) \nVideo Aspect Ratio: 4:3 \nAudio Codec: AC3 \nAudio BitRate: 192 kbps \nAudio Channels: 96 Ch Stereo; 48000 Hz \nRunTime Per Part: 30 mins \nNumber Of Parts: 4 \nPart Size: 350 mb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6c3ff81283bc35067de66fc79e249a0464c080d","amp;dn":"The+Knights+Templar+-+Pt.2+-+Corporation+%5BDivX-AC3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6c3ff81283bc35067de66fc79e249a0464c080d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,195,255,129,40,59,195,80,103,222,102,252,121,226,73,160,70,76,8,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
