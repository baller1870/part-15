The Sequel to Saltation.\n\nAelliana Caylon has endured much, and finally, she appears to have won all: a spaceship, comrades, friends -- and the love of a pilot she adores.\n\nEven better that her loverÃ¢â‚¬â€the man who was destined for her, a man as much a loner as sheÃ¢â‚¬â€is also the Delm of Korval, arguably the most powerful person on all of Liad. He has the power to remove her and protect her from the toxic environment of her home Clan. Best of all, he agrees to sit as her co-pilot and her partner in a courier business.\n\nEven happy endings sometimes show a few flaws. Such as Aelliana's home clan being not as agreeable to letting her go as it had first seemed. And the fact that someone is stealing pilots in the Low Port, which falls within the Delm of Korval's honor. Oh, and the revelation that the man she lovesÃ¢â‚¬â€the man who is destined for herÃ¢â‚¬â€isn't entirely the man she thought he was. And finally, she discovers that even the lift from Liad she'd so fervently desired, is part of a larger plan, a plan requiring her to be someone she never thought she was, or could be.\n\n\nNarrated by: Bernadette Dunne\nLength: 12 hrs and 27 mins \nFormat: M4A\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged Audiobook\nRelease Date:09-04-12\nPublisher: Audible Studios","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b057924bd850a58729374060428c90d7e64ad5af","amp;dn":"Sharon+Lee%2C+Steve+Miller+-+Mouse+and+Dragon+%28Liaden+Universe+%237%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b057924bd850a58729374060428c90d7e64ad5af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,87,146,75,216,80,165,135,41,55,64,96,66,140,144,215,230,74,213,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
