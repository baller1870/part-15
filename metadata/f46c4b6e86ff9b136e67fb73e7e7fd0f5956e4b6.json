Clapton put his band in a three-carriage train, originally at the disposal of Hermann Goering during the Nazi years in Germany, and traveled from town to town on the continent, from one concert to the next. It was an easy way to transport and house the band and equipment, and it offered ample opportunity for interviews, groups interactions, and filming. Clapton talks about his music and his works and peaks the viewers interest with stories about musicians like Hendrix and George Harrison. The interviews are supplemented with performances by Muddy waters, Elton John and George Harrison, as well as Clapton and his band. Tracks featured are Cocaine, Further On Up The Road, Lay Down Sally, Tulsa Time, Worried Life Blues, Early in the Morning, Badge, Wonderful Tonight, Key to the Highway, Double Trouble, Crossroads and Layla. \n\nBand line-up :\nEric Clapton : guitar, vocals\nCarl Radle : bass\nJamie Oldaker : drums\nDick Sims : keyboards\n\nProduced and Directed by Rex Pyke\n\nAngle Films Ltd 1979\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1495 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x544\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.294:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 1:13:54\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 960 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f46c4b6e86ff9b136e67fb73e7e7fd0f5956e4b6","amp;dn":"RSO.Eric.Clapton.and.his.Rolling.Hotel.XviD.AC3.MVGroup.Forum.av","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f46c4b6e86ff9b136e67fb73e7e7fd0f5956e4b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,108,75,110,134,255,155,19,110,103,251,115,231,231,253,15,89,86,228,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
