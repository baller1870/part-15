Paxson\n\nÃƒï¿½satrÃƒÂº (the troth of the Ãƒâ€ sir) or Heathenry (the Germanic pagan tradition) comes from a group of cultures with strong warrior traditions, and many heathens proudly serve in their countriesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Armed Forces. However, military life, however you may serve, is different from life as a civilian. Those of us looking for a way to support our heathen soldiers realized that there was a need for a heathen book addressed specifically to those serving in the military.\n\nThe Troth task group that came together to consider ways to work with our military members suggested two major needsÃ¢â‚¬â€inspiration, counsel, and comfort from the lore, and practical information on how to practice our religion in a military setting. This book therefore has several purposes.\n\nPart One is a heathen Ã¢â‚¬Å“devotional manualÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which includes discussions of the heathen virtues, short essays on the gods and goddesses, inspiring quotations from the lore, prayers and protective spells. Part Two addresses the legal and practical aspects of practicing heathenry on base, including the religious rights of military personnel and advice on how to conduct group activities. In the Appendices you will find examples of military rites of passage, a description of Ãƒï¿½satrÃƒÂº that can be copied for military chaplains and other personnel, and a section on post-combat issues that addresses the sometimes traumatic effects of military service on veterans and families.\n\nIf youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re new to heathenry, Part One (the devotional manual) will serve as an introduction. Use the recommended resources to learn more. If you have been heathen for awhile or come from an established kindred with its own traditions, you will probably find the information in Part Two most useful. Regardless, remember that heathenry is full of knowledgeable people with strong opinions who do not always agree. So, aside from the quotations from the lore and military regulations, consider everything in this book a guideline. Use the parts that speak to you, and adapt or skip those that do not. If any information in this book is out-of-date, feel free to contact us at www.thetroth.org. If we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have an update online, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll try to help you find information.\n\nWe are grateful to those military personnel who have provided insights and suggestions, especially SSG Fred Twombly, Josh Heath, SPC, and his wife Cat, Major Erik Goodwyn, Corporal John T. Mainer (retired), Kristina Shepherd and other members of the Troth. Thanks also to Lorrie Wood and Ben Waggoner for help with proofreading and production.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“All hail to thy going, all hail to thy coming, All hail to thee, hence and hither!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nVafÃƒÂ¾rÃƒÂºÃƒÂ°nismÃƒÂ¡l: 4\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Diana L.

Some usual basic image improving procedures, and it's done. Haven't really read this one through, mainly because of the simple fact that I am no military operator. And I doubt I will ever be, at least not in a regular army.\nBut as the drums of war are beaten more loudly every day now, it seems, it feels worthwhile to let this one out too. If you know anyone currently in the military, let them know of this book, and (of course) tell them to spread it further. It's mainly directed to American soldiers, but any soldier might find this interesting.\n\nI might state that [DerHammer] doesn't really care for US military affairs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ we neither condone nor condemn their ideology or strategies. This is already a foul world, full of owl worshiping, mind controlling black magician wannabe psychopaths, with all too much power in their hands. And it has to go, either way. So let's keep on beating those drums of war, and see what comes out of it.\n\nShare and seed until RagnarÃƒÂ¶k!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66fbb2082cc25e65657fb92f07f2f00df5003ce9","amp;dn":"Words+for+Warriors%3A+A+Resource+for+Heathens+in+the+Military+-+Di","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66fbb2082cc25e65657fb92f07f2f00df5003ce9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,251,178,8,44,194,94,101,101,127,185,47,7,242,240,13,245,0,60,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
