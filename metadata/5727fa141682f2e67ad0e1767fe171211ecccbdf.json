Thrust into an unfamiliar world by a stranger with a dangerous agenda, Etta is certain of only one thing: she has traveled not just miles but years from home. And sheâ€™s inherited a legacy she knows nothing about from a family whose existence sheâ€™s never heard of. Until now.\r\n\r\nNicholas Carter is content with his life at sea, free from the Ironwoodsâ€”a powerful family in the coloniesâ€”and the servitude heâ€™s known at their hands. But with the arrival of an unusual passenger on his ship comes the insistent pull of the past that he canâ€™t escape and the family that wonâ€™t let him go so easily. Now the Ironwoods are searching for a stolen object of untold value, one they believe only Etta, Nicholasâ€™ passenger, can find. In order to protect her, he must ensure she brings it back to themâ€” whether she wants to or not.\r\n\r\nTogether, Etta and Nicholas embark on a perilous journey across centuries and continents, piecing together clues left behind by the traveler who will do anything to keep the object out of the Ironwoodsâ€™ grasp. But as they get closer to the truth of their search, and the deadly game the Ironwoods are playÂ­ing, treacherous forces threaten to sepÂ­arate Etta not only from Nicholas but from her path home . . . forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you enjoyed the book, please support the author.
