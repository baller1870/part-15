Detached Isolated &amp; Remote (05:40)\n\n\n\n\n\n                                   NOTE:\n\n And what a swanky, swirling, sophisticated happy hour it is! A mingling melange of smooth grooves and chilled tracks from beginning to end.\n Evolve has a superb and intelligent recording here; one that makes even the most blase music enthusiast sit up and take notice with its rich instrumentation and arrangements featuring killer drum programming and loops, trumpet, flugelhorn and keyboards, as well as brilliant lyrical notions and outstanding vocals from the sultry Margo Reymundo and intriguing nu-rap from Tantrum.\n The man behind the evolution of Evolve? Only the coolest Brit in California with a name to match, Red Broad. Red's work on HAPPY HOUR IN THE GENE POOL is deep and poignant, yet shallow enough to wade in with friends while sipping cocktails.\n Evolve is genre defining in my opinion; a standard by which other artists should measure their work and quality. In a time when the music industry requires life support, Evolve has just shot an injection of clever and unique into its veins and offers the consumer a reason to buy the entire project, not just a tune.\n More please! More music that appeals to the senses and packages itself in a stunning, shiny digipak that you never want to put down. SmoothLounge invites you to Evolve.\n\n\n\n             Evolve - Deeper Than the Sea (2013) Album @ MP3 Downtempo \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9407275/Evolve_-_Deeper_Than_the_Sea_(2013)_Album___MP3_Downtempo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9407275/Evolve_-_Deeper_Than_the_Sea_(2013)_Album___MP3_Downtempo&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88d53ebba59847703b80deae3b54f66f3861751a","amp;dn":"Evolve+-+Happy+Hour+in+the+Gene+Pool+%5BRemastered%5D+%282013%29+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88d53ebba59847703b80deae3b54f66f3861751a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,213,62,187,165,152,71,112,59,128,222,174,59,84,246,111,56,97,117,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
