What he found was shocking: as the climate warms and world population grows, demand for water has surged, but supplies of freshwater are static or dropping, and new threats to water quality appear every day. \nThe Ripple Effect is PrudÃ¢â‚¬â„¢hommeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vivid and engaging inquiry into the fate of freshwater in the twenty-first century.\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;\n\nvisit me on facebook -  Google &quot;TEAM NANBAN TPB&quot;\n        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/05ae/a975cee.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/05ae/a975cee.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTO JOIN TMRG ON FACEBOOK\nTMRG IS TORRENT MAFIA RELEASE GROUP\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13e2940b661cecd7e7ae05ae4f4b469a45478ac2","amp;dn":"The+Ripple+Effect-+The+Fate+of+Fresh+Water+in+the+Twenty-First+C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13e2940b661cecd7e7ae05ae4f4b469a45478ac2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,226,148,11,102,28,236,215,231,174,5,174,79,75,70,154,69,71,138,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
