Establishing a scholarly foundation for the study of this music, Raul A. Fernandez introduces a set of terms, definitions, and empirical information that allow for a broader, more informed discussion. He presents fascinating musical biographies of prominent performers Cachao LÃƒÂ³pez, Mongo SantamarÃƒÂ­a, Armando Peraza, Patato ValdÃƒÂ©s, Francisco Aguabella, CÃƒÂ¡ndido Camero, Chocolate Armenteros, and Celia Cruz. Based on interviews that the author conducted over a nine-year period, these profiles provide in-depth assessments of the musicians' substantial contributions to both Afro-Cuban music and Latin Jazz. In addition, Fernandez examines the links between Cuban music and other Caribbean musics; analyzes the musical and poetic foundations of the Cuban son form; addresses the salsa phenomenon; and develops the aesthetic construct of sabor, central to Cuban music.\nCopub: Center for Black Music Research","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fbc8142293f6240fd225e116352acddc41d5c58","amp;dn":"From+Afro-Cuban+Rhythms+to+Latin+Jazz+%28Music+of+the+African+Dias","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fbc8142293f6240fd225e116352acddc41d5c58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,188,129,66,41,63,98,64,253,34,94,17,99,82,172,221,196,29,92,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
