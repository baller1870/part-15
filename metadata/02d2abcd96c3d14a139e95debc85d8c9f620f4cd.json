This is a celebration of our adrenaline-fuelled passion to go faster than ever before. So sit back, buckle up and prepare to be overwhelmed by the need for speed.\n\n\n\n\n3)  The Landspeed Record \nAfter many trials and tribulations, we follow the continued attempts of Craig Breedlove and Richard Noble to achieve the elusive landspeed record. We follow Richard Noble's tests and preparation in the Jordan desert and look at the new modifications to his car. This film culminates with Noble and Breedlove's head-to-head challenge at Blackrock in September 1997, each driver hungry not only for the record, but also to go supersonic!\n\nNarrator: William Hootkins\nDirector: Brian Leckey\nProducer: Alice Harper\nExecutive Producer: Stuart Carter\nExecutive Producer for the Learning Channel: Susan Winslow\nProduced By Pioneer Productions For The Learning Channel\nPioneer Productions TLC\n1999 Discovery Communications, Inc.\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2176 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x528\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 52:18.520\nNumber Of Parts: 9\nPart Size: 894 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02d2abcd96c3d14a139e95debc85d8c9f620f4cd","amp;dn":"DC+Extreme+Machines+The+Need+for+Speed+3of9+The+Landspeed+Record","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02d2abcd96c3d14a139e95debc85d8c9f620f4cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,210,171,205,150,195,209,74,19,158,149,222,188,133,216,201,246,32,244,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
