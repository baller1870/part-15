It reaches the same peak \r\nlevel as the official releases! Robert's voice is in pretty bad shape, but \r\nthe instrumental machine is playing fine. Jones and Bonham in particular \r\nare wonderful, with Bonham reaching a peak of playing in Sick Again and In \r\nMy Time Of Dying that is staggering. Well presented mellotron has been \r\nintroduced tonight: &quot;John Paul Jones played mellotron, a very cheap form of \r\norchestration ... and he doesn't cost that much to rent either!&quot; No Quarter \r\ncould be a fine version but is cut. Trampled Underfoot is outstanding and \r\nvocal lyrics near the end are awesome. Also the audience was rather dull so \r\nPlant was trying to inject the life to the crowd: &quot;Why don't you wake up, c'mon!&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:216642b7221d1e50e0053fd2736974be07830a12","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1975.03.04+Dallas%2C+Texas+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"216642b7221d1e50e0053fd2736974be07830a12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,102,66,183,34,29,30,80,224,5,63,210,115,105,116,190,7,131,10,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
