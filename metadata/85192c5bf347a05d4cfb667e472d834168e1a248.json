Working with high school friends Dave Moody, Mark Lerner (Rosine,) Rebecca Weiner (Patti Smith,) Ken Meyer, John Donne, and Al Houghton (a frequent They Might Be Giants collaborator,) Life in a Blender is a project that is often put on hold due to the member's various musical commitments. Still, as members of They Might Be Giants' inner circle, they enjoy a status as a cute and lovable pop band that hides a twisted sense of humor and wicked attitude underneath the surface. Starting in the late 80's, the band comes together every four to six years and makes fun rock music that offers a deranged lyrical viewpoint in contrast to the jangly guitars and lushly produced music. Based in Brooklyn, New York, the band makes waves in their home city with fun publicity stunts such as performing at a strip club art opening, and playing &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; on the street in their underwear. A lengthy absence marked the time between records after Motivational Tape #1, but they returned in 2002 with Tell Me I'm Pretty.\n\nTaken from: http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:3xfyxqwgldte~T1\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nAdmittedly it's a case of slightly dashed expectations (for some) when it turns out that opening song &quot;Something Must Break&quot; is an original rather than a Joy Division cover, but who says that titles can't be used again, after all? As for Life in a Blender itself, at this stage in its lengthy existence the Brooklyn-based septet seems to occupy a quirky space between Firewater and Soul Coughing when it comes to try-anything-once eclecticism with the lead singer's voice and vision front and center. In that regard the group seems like one of those many New York bands that has a love and hate relationship with rock &amp; roll as such -- they can certainly crank the volume as needed and drummer Ken Meyer can get some full-bodied stomp in, but there's no mistaking them for the Yeah Yeah Yeahs or the Ramones. Lead figure and songwriter Don Ralph is unsurprisingly still at the core of it all when it comes to how the band can both work and not work in equal measure. Sometimes he seems to be exaggerating a strident speak-singing approach that aims for wry and witty but can just be tiring (or else seems to be trying to fulfill the non-present demand for a clear-singing Tom Waits). Then again, he can just as easily find a breezy, bemused wistfulness that works far better, sometimes in the same song (&quot;Kent&quot; and &quot;Paterson Falls&quot; in particular capture him at both his best and worst). When both band and singer bring it together to concentrate on a good song -- the wistful New Orleans jazz/sea shantey tip to the street cleaners &quot;Mobile Wash Unit,&quot; the spaghetti Western-tinged drama of &quot;Eyes Are Red&quot; -- then the group really has a certain fun and entertaining something.\n\nMore album detail at: http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:h9fwxqwaldse\n\nAt the above link you can listen to samples of all the tracks.\n\nThe band's page can be found at: http://www.lifeinablender.net/\nWhere all eight of their CDs are available for purchase.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
