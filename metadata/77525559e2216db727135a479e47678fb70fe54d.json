The recording was produced by George Lucas and Alan Livingston, and was narrated by Roscoe Lee Browne. The script was adapted by E. Jack Kaplan and Cheryl Gard.\n\nThe original film became a hit in the days before home video, so for many fans, this album was the closest to owning a copy of the film they could revisit whenever they wanted. The album was also released on compact cassette, 8-track tape, and even 4-track reel-to-reel audio tape. It was a commercial success and achieved Gold Record status. The sequel films, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, saw a similar record release.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77525559e2216db727135a479e47678fb70fe54d","amp;dn":"The+Story+of+Star+Wars+%5B1977%5D+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77525559e2216db727135a479e47678fb70fe54d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,82,85,89,226,33,109,183,39,19,90,71,158,71,103,143,183,15,229,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
