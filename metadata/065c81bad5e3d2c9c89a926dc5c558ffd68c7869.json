This controversial work has become the foundation of modern textbooks for scientific studies in origins, though Darwin himself expressed deep doubts about his own speculations and suppositions.\n\nSecrets of the Sixth Editionby Randall Hedtke exposes the critical flaws of this landmark book by using Darwin's own words against him.\n\n-Provides an examination of Darwin's research and the faulty basis of his scientific writings\n-Filled with extensive documentation looking at the fatal flaws in Darwin's assumptions\n-Addresses strategies for possible changes to curriculum to address weaknesses in the evolutionary hypothesis.\n\nTake an insightful look at Darwin's work and its inaccuracies from a fresh and logical perspective. You will discover the often ignored reasoning behind his own abandonment of some of the core mechanisms of evolution later in his life, though they remain unchallenged pillars of unquestioning science today. This informative and easy-to-read study boldly declares the powerful truth that only biblical creation can explain.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nRandall Hedtke has read, written, and taught about the controversy of creation-evolution for decades. The basis for much of the Secrets of the Sixth Edition were originally formed in a series of essays originally published in the Creation Research Society Quarterly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:065c81bad5e3d2c9c89a926dc5c558ffd68c7869","amp;dn":"Secrets+of+the+Sixth+Edition+-+Randall+Hedtke","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"065c81bad5e3d2c9c89a926dc5c558ffd68c7869","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,92,129,186,213,227,210,201,200,154,146,109,197,197,88,255,214,140,120,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
