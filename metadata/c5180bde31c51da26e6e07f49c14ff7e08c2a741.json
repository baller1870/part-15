They all have the obligatory history, concert footage, interviews with band members, agents, and managers, and some obligatory trivia that true fans wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t find surprising.\n\nThe Emerson, Lake and Palmer Beyond the Beginning DVD contains some great material, but stays within the standard format. There are moments that are instructional and even captivating, but much of the material presented is either incomplete, edited poorly, or out of synchronization. Still, hyper-fans of the ex-super group will find much of Beyond the Beginning worth viewing if only for the 1974 California Jam footage alone.\n\nThe documentary begins with videos culled from vocalist/guitarist Greg LakeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s brief tenure with King Crimson, a small bit of Keith EmersonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work with The Nice, and a rather annoying performance from The Crazy World of Arthur Brown featuring Carl Palmer on drums. Emerson, Lake, Palmer provide voice-over commentary to these sequences which unintentionally reveal the reason behind Lake and EmersonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s departures from their groups, and why Palmer went on to found Atomic Rooster.\n\nThe visuals of ELP in concert are also revealing. The comments of the band and tour manager delve into the repetitive and exhaustive European and Asian tours ELP embarked upon. But the various camera zoom-ins on the performersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ faces during these tours speak much louder to the frustrations and frazzling the band experienced during their years on the road.\n\nWhat distinguishes this documentary is much of the bonus footage included. There are some tremendous shots of the band during a 1973 rehearsal, where we see how ELP worked to bring their fresh approach on classical standards. Emerson clearly is in the lead here, and his communication with Palmer in coordinating the percussive parts with the keyboards is truly a fascinating look at how two top-tiered musicians weave intricate tones together into an amazing mix of sounds.\n\n\n\nDVD INFO\n\nDVDI : Size: 7.81 Gb ( 8 192 354 KBytes ) - DVD-9\nPlay Length: 02:27:45\nDVDII: Size: 5.99 Gb ( 6 280 834 KBytes ) - DVD-9\nPlay Length: 00:59:59\nEnabled regions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\nVideo: PAL 4:3 (720x576) VBR\nAudio: Not specified (Dolby AC3, 2 ch)\nSubtitles: English, Francais, Italiano, Deutsch,Espanol\nMenu Video:\nPAL 4:3 (720x576) VBR\nMenu Subtitles:\nNot specified\nMenu English Language Unit :\nRoot Menu ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5180bde31c51da26e6e07f49c14ff7e08c2a741","amp;dn":"EMERSON+LIKE+%26+PALMER+ELP+Beyond+The+Beginning+%282005%292xDVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5180bde31c51da26e6e07f49c14ff7e08c2a741","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,24,11,222,49,197,29,162,110,110,7,244,156,20,255,126,8,194,167,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
