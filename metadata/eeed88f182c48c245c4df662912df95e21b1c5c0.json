Jan DÃƒÂ­te is released from prison after serving 15 years. He goes into semi exile in a deserted village near the German border. In flashbacks, he tells his story: he's a small, clever and quick-witted young man, stubbornly naÃƒÂ¯ve, a vendor at a train station. Thanks to a patron, he becomes a waiter at upscale hotels and restaurants. We see him discover how the wealthy tick and how to please women. He strives to be a millionaire with his own hotel. Before the war, he meets LÃƒÂ­za, a German woman in Prague. Is this his ticket to wealth or his undoing? Meanwhile, we see Jan putting a life together after prison: why was he sentenced, and who will he become?\n\nFrom Czech Republic in Czech\n\nSubtitles by SBS AU TV\n\nPlease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eeed88f182c48c245c4df662912df95e21b1c5c0","amp;dn":"I+Served+the+King+of+England+-+Eng+Subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eeed88f182c48c245c4df662912df95e21b1c5c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,237,136,241,130,196,140,36,92,77,246,98,145,45,249,94,33,177,197,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
