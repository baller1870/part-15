Every effort has been made to make Civil War reliable and complete â€” the book was created with The Smithsonian Institution, using artifacts and photographs from its unparalleled collections.\r\nEven 150 years after the end of the Civil War, the effects of this war are still relevant, but because the war ended so long ago, its events can seem very far away. With Civil War, striking photographs bring the time period back to life. We feel as if we're walking through American history, standing at the side of Abraham Lincoln as he talks about slavery, or walking through the battle camps of the Confederacy. Matthew Brady's personality-filled portraits and battlefield landscapes bring the Civil War to life, and images of artifacts belonging to soldiers, families, and field hospitals make the Civil War story intensely personal. With new photography and updated battleground and historic site information, Civil War is truly an important portrait of a transformative time in American history","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07649a14a673e6f083705bd5233fd61185d6c12d","amp;dn":"The+Civil+War+-+A+Visual+History+-+Rev+Ed+%282015%29+%28DK%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07649a14a673e6f083705bd5233fd61185d6c12d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,100,154,20,166,115,230,240,131,112,91,213,35,63,214,17,133,214,193,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
