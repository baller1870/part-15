The seventh child of the Jackson family, he debuted on the professional music scene at the age of 11 as a member of The Jackson 5 and began a solo career in 1971 while still a member of the group. Referred to as the &quot;King of Pop&quot; in subsequent years, five of his solo studio albums have become some of the world's best-selling records: Off the Wall (1979), Thriller (1982), Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991) and HIStory (1995).\n\nIn the early 1980s, he became a dominant figure in popular music and the first African-American entertainer to amass a strong crossover following on MTV. The popularity of his music videos airing on MTV, such as &quot;Beat It&quot;, &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and ThrillerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½credited for transforming the music video into an art form and a promotional toolÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½helped bring the relatively new channel to fame. Videos such as &quot;Black or White&quot; and &quot;Scream&quot; made Jackson an enduring staple on MTV in the 1990s. With stage performances and music videos, Jackson popularized a number of physically complicated dance techniques, such as the robot and the moonwalk. His distinctive musical sound and vocal style influenced hip hop, pop and contemporary R&amp;B artists.\n\nJackson donated and raised millions of dollars for beneficial causes through his foundation, charity singles and support of 39 charities. Other aspects of his personal life, including his changing appearance and behavior, generated significant controversy, damaging his public image. Though he was accused of child sexual abuse in 1993, the criminal investigation was closed due to lack of evidence and Jackson was not charged. The singer experienced health concerns from the early 1990s until his death, as well as conflicting reports regarding the state of his finances. Jackson married twice and fathered three children, all of which caused further controversy. In 2005, Jackson was tried and acquitted of further sexual abuse allegations and several other charges.\n\nOne of the few artists to have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, his other achievements include multiple Guinness World RecordsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including one for &quot;Most Successful Entertainer of All Time&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½13 Grammy Awards, 13 number one singles in his solo careerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 eraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and the sales of over 750 million albums worldwide. Cited as one of the world's most famous men, Jackson's highly publicized personal life, coupled with his successful career, made him a part of popular culture for almost four decades.\n\nOn June 25, 2009, he collapsed at his home in Los Angeles.[3] After being taken to the hospital in a coma, Jackson was reportedly pronounced dead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDangerous 1991\n\n\n\nDangerous is the eighth album by Michael Jackson, released on November 26, 1991. It became his second to debut at #1 on the Billboard 200 album chart, where it spent the next four consecutive weeks. In the space of 17 years, the record has sold over 32 million copies worldwide, with 7 million shipments in the United States alone, making it a faster selling album than his previous record Bad. The album won one Grammy for Best Engineered Album - Non Classical won by Bruce Swedien &amp; Teddy Riley[2] and is the most successful New Jack Swing album of all time.[3]\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1. &quot;Jam&quot;  \n2. &quot;Why You Wanna Trip on Me&quot;  \n3. &quot;In the Closet&quot;  \n4. &quot;She Drives Me Wild&quot;  \n5. &quot;Remember the Time&quot;  \n6. &quot;Can't Let Her Get Away&quot;  \n7. &quot;Heal the World&quot;  \n8. &quot;Black or White&quot; (feat.

The former is a duet with his younger sister Janet Jackson, whereas the latter is a solo piece.\n\n&quot;Scream&quot; is cited primarily as an aggressive, retaliatory song directed at the tabloid media and their coverage of the child sexual abuse accusations made against Michael Jackson in 1993. &quot;Scream&quot; was written, composed and produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis; Jackson played many of the instruments. It incorporates elements of pop, R&amp;B, hip hop, funk and rock. The song was leaked to radio stations early, despite Epic Records attempt to keep it off air until the official release date. Generally well received amongst critics, it has been compared favorably to other accomplished pieces by Jackson. It went on to be nominated for a Grammy Award and an American Music Award. The corresponding music video remains one of Jackson's most critically acclaimed pieces; it won numerous MTV Video Music Awards and a Grammy. At a cost of $ 7 million, it is listed in the Guinness World Records as the most expensive music video ever made. The imagery in &quot;Scream&quot; has been replicated in several contemporary pieces, including &quot;No Scrubs&quot; by TLC and &quot;Shawty Get Loose&quot; by Lil Mama.\n\n&quot;Childhood&quot;, the corresponding B-side, is a biographical song written and composed by Michael Jackson solely. The theme of the track centers around his difficult childhood experiences. It would become the main theme song for Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home, continuing his association with the Free Willy series. The track appeared on several compilation albums, but was met with a mixed reception amongst critics. The song's music video, which had little in common with the supporting film, has been critically praised.\n\n&quot;Scream&quot;/&quot;Childhood&quot; would become the first single in the 37 year history of Billboard to debut at number five on the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked. It was a worldwide hit, reaching the top five in the vast majority of major music markets.\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nScream (Naughty Radio Edit with Rap)\nScream (Naughty Radio Edit no Rap)\nScream (Dave ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  HallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Urban Remix Edit\nScream (Def Radio Mix)\nScream (Single Edit)\nChildhood\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy this torrent :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a32ce59ef77d87f898cc80c4049b37e1930f7ff8","amp;dn":"Michael+Jackson+-+Dangerous+and+Scream+%28single%29+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a32ce59ef77d87f898cc80c4049b37e1930f7ff8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,44,229,158,247,125,135,248,152,204,128,196,4,155,55,225,147,15,127,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
