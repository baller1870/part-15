They envisioned a\nsociety free of witchcraft, which they viewed as heresy, a\nscourge, an evil and a blight. They would be astonished today\nto find that WitchcraftÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½with a capital WÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½has become\none of the fastest-growing religions in Western culture.\nHow did this 180-degree turn take place?\nThe road from sorcery to spirituality is a colorful one,\nfull of secrets, twists, rituals and compelling personalities.\nIn its short half century as a religion, Witchcraft has\na history rivaling that of any of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s great faiths\nin drama, intrigue, pathos and triumph. Witchcraft has\ntaken its place in the ecumenical religious theater.\nTraditionally, witchcraftÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½with a small wÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½is a form\nof sorcery, concerned with spells and divination. The\nmagical witch, the sorcerer witch, was not practicing a\nreligion of witchcraft, but was practicing a magical art,\npassed down through families or taught by adepts.\nWitches have never enjoyed a good reputation. Almost\nuniversally since ancient times, witchcraft has been associated\nwith malevolence and evil. Witches are thought\nto be up to no good, interested in wreaking havoc and\nbringing misery to others. Individuals who used the magical\narts to divine and to heal often took great pains to call\nthemselves something other than ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwitch.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nIn Christianity, witchcraft became interpreted as serving\nthe Devil in his plan to subvert and destroy souls. A\nwitch hysteria mounted in Europe, Britain and even the\nAmerican colonies and was seized upon by the church as\na way of eliminating rival religious sects, political enemies\nand social outcasts. From the 14th to 18th centuries,\nthousands of peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½perhaps hundreds of thousandsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nwere tortured, jailed, maimed and executed on charges of\nwitchcraft. Many of them were innocent, framed by personal\nenemies or tortured into confessions.\nThey told lurid stories of signing pacts with the Devil\nin blood, of being given demons in the form of animal\nfamiliars that would do their malevolent bidding and of\nattending horrid feasts called sabbats, where they would\nkiss the anus of the Devil and roast babies for a meal.\nNone of these tales was ever substantiated by fact, but\nthey served as sufficient evidence to condemn those who\nconfessed to them.\nThe accused also admitted to doing evil to their families,\nfriends, neighbors, rivals and enemies. How much\nof that was true is uncertain. Folk magic practices were\npart of everyday life, and casting a spell against someone,\nespecially to redress a wrong, was commonplace. Since\nmost confessions were extracted under fear and torture,\nit is likely that a great deal of untruth and exaggeration\nspilled out.\nIn the American colonies, the Puritans were obsessed\nwith evil and believed the Devil had followed them across\nthe ocean from England to destroy them. No wonder this\nparanoia erupted into witch hunts, including those in Salem,\nMassachusetts, in 1692, when the tales of hysterical\ngirls were enough to send people to their deaths.\nThe stigma upon witchcraft left by the Inquisition and\nwitch hunts lingers to this day.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe6a35447d6144fc7a498da8d911e470df840bbf","amp;dn":"The+Encyclopedia+of+Witches%2C+Witchcraft%2C+and+Wicca.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe6a35447d6144fc7a498da8d911e470df840bbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,106,53,68,125,97,68,252,122,73,141,168,217,17,228,112,223,132,11,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
