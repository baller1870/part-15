Bob Parr), and his wife Helen (A.K.A. Elastigirl), are the world's greatest famous crime-fighting superheroes in Metroville. Always saving lives and battling evil on a daily basis. But fifteen years later, they have been forced to adopt civilian identities and retreat to the suburbs where they have no choice but to retire of being a superhero and force to live a &quot;normal life&quot; with their three children Violet, Dash and Jack-Jack (who were secretly born with superpowers).\n\nItching to get back into action, Bob gets his chance when a mysterious communication summons him to a remote island for a top secret assignment.
