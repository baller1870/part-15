The purpose is physical control of the mind. Everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated. The individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence, but this is only his personal point of view. Man does not have the right to develop his own mind. We must electronically control the brain. Someday armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â»\nDr JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Delgado, Yale University Medical School\nCongressional Record,\nNo. 26, Vol. 118 February 24, 1974\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â«What is called for here is not genocide, the killing off of the population of incompetent cultures. But we do need to think realistically in terms of the 'phasing out' of such peoples. Evolutionary progress means the extinction of the less competent.\nSurvival of the fittest, extinction of the unfit. This is the way to a better world.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â»\nProf. Richard Lynn (2004), &quot;A Review of 'A New Morality from Science: Beyondism'&quot;, Irish Journal of Psychology, 2.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nTranshumanism was founded in the 1950s by top eugenicist Julian Huxley and the Rockefeller Foundation, as a new brand name for the pseudoscience of Eugenics. Its obsession for culling off the 'genetically inferior', while at the same time striving to promote dominance for the 'superior' had given Eugenics a bad name, particularly after the Nazi brand of Eugenics created the Holocaust, during WWII. Sadly, what most people didn't know at that time was that Nazi eugenics was merely the full-blown application of the principles that had been developed and were openly espoused by the British, French and American Eugenics Societies.\n\nSo, Eugenics lived on, under many, heavily funded formats, one of them being Transhumanism. By and large, Transhumanism proposes to use applied science in the fields of genetics, robotics and others, to 'steer human evolution into the future'. A Transhumanist society will have, as its name implies, 'transcended humanity'. In such a society, human beings will have been replaced with hyper-efficient worker chimeras, bio-robotic warriors, and other purpose-made humanoid life forms.\n\nThese stated goals must be tied in with the bigger picture into which Eugenics and Transhumanism fit into. These fields have never been limited to 'science' per se -- they've always been primarily political and economical, and they reflect a very particular view of the world.\n\nUnder that view, the planet has limited resources, and technological advancement under free market systems cannot be trusted to overcome those limitations (one of the many Malthusian fallacies and myths) -- therefore, control must be exercised over the users of resources, to avoid any over-usage of those resources. To exercise that control, eugenicists believe they have to shut down development, and create an heavily regulated social and economic environment. In that controlled environment, those people who are alive must also be economically efficient -- i.e., produce more than they consume. So, on the one hand, the intelligentsia feels it needs to get rid of the 'wrong' sorts of people (the masses of 'unfit', 'unemployables', 'junk genes'), through techniques such as famine, abortion, sterilization, or euthanasia. On the other hand, the workers that will be allowed to go on into the future will have to be made into incrementally more 'efficient' humans -- which will eventually imply robotic add-ons and genetic-engineering.\n\nThis is none other than the worldwide, dehumanized, hyper-efficient 'hive society', that was advocated by eugenicist Charles Galton Darwin in &quot;The Next Million Years&quot;. Or, &quot;Our Benevolent Feudalism&quot;, as eugenicist William J. Ghent put it, in his portrayal of the techno-fascist global society that, he said, would eventually be ushered in, using the combined power of finance and science. And, of course, it was also explained in romanticized form in the &quot;Brave New World&quot; of Aldous Huxley, who was none other than the brother of Transhumanism founder, Eugenics Society chairman, Julian Huxley.\n\nA neo-feudal, technocratic, new world order. That's what Eugenics and its offspring Transhumanism, strive for. A system under which you will not just lose your physical rights to independent living (and that is happening right now as this video plays), but you will also be engineered to lose your very soul. Since, as Charles Galton Darwin put it, you will be nothing more than a good worker, which includes being engineered to have the right beliefs, or no beliefs at all.\n\nThat is the final and most serious note of mental and spiritual disease behind this incredibly selfish and hypocritical paradigm.\nAnd that is why it must be stopped.\n\n\nKATHERINE ALBRECHT ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ On The Brink Of The Mark:\nThis documentary is an eye opener for us to understand the dangers of technology that currently exists on Earth. The documentary examines the chips through the Revelation of John in the Bible. Although not drawn to religion and religious dogmas have to accept that some things in the Bible prophecies are quite clear. Christians have their share of justice;)\nAdvocate Katherine Albrecht is the leader of consumer resistance in terms of supermarket loyalty cards and RFID chip implantation (Radio Frequency Identification). In this presentation sensational, Katherine gives us the information and tools we need to be aware in order to combat the system.\n\n\nMikeHoggard - Watchman Video Broadcast 4-17-11:\nTopics:\n   Strange Markings on Glenn Beck,\n   Human-Animal Hybrids,\n   Building BRICS of the New World Order,\n   They Sold Their Souls for Rock and Roll,\n   ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and much more.\n\n\nThe Entire Collection can be found here: \n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011.

He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nMore Torrents in this series atALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!! The First down loaders of my torrents get the Main Hookups on my SERVER.
