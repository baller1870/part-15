Batman finds out that a crazed clown calling himself Joker is behind the breakout, and he plans to make a blimp full of Joker venom to explode over Gotham City so that every citizen turns into a lunatic. \n\nEpisode 2-&quot;Traction&quot;\nThree mob bosses want revenge on Batman because he constantly took down their operations. They call in a mysterious assassin named Bane to finish him off, once and for all. Bane may seem like a normal criminal, but he has a secret so powerful that it could destroy all of Gotham. After their first encounter, Bane easily takes down Batman, seriously injuring him. Now, Batman must think of a new way to stop this menace. \n\nEpisode 3 - &quot;Call of the Cobblepot&quot;\nAfter a strange vulture starts to steal diamonds and jewels, Batman decides to find out who's behind this. It turns out that the crook is Oswald Cobblepot, aka Penguin, a socialite who attends Bruce Wayne's party. Alfred tries to catch Penguin for his misbehavior at the party, but unfortunately, Penguin catches Alfred. Batman must find Penguin's mansion and save Alfred, as well as defeat the Pudgy Purveyor of Perfidy and return all the jewels and gems he has stolen. \n\nEpisode 4 - &quot;The Man Who Would Be Bat&quot;\nA flock of bats lead Yin and Bennett to Wayne Industries, where Bruce has a scientist named Dr. Langstrom working on a project related to bats. In truth, Langstrom actually develops a serum that can turn him into the &quot;Man-Bat.&quot; The creature goes out of control and flies out into the city, feeding on animal blood. \n\nEpisode 5 - &quot;The Big Chill&quot;\nUsing his new ice powers, Mister Freeze steals the rarest and most valuable diamonds all over Gotham. When he and Batman first cross paths, he reveals that he was once a normal criminal, and was rendered dependent on a cryogenic suit after an encounter with the Dark Knight. He will stop at nothing to make Gotham his own personal domain, unless Batman can think of a way to stop this menace. \n\nEpisode 6 - &quot;The Cat and the Bat&quot;\nBatman chases his new foe, Catwoman, who steals his utility belt. Now, with his belt in the wrong hands, Batman must figure out how to find the cat burglar before she puts his belt to no good use. \n\nEpisode 7 - &quot;The Big Heat&quot;\nBatman meets Firefly, a man who dresses in a heavily-armored fly ensemble and has a turbo-enhanced jetpack. Firefly breaks into numerous Gotham companies, destroying their technology, and takes to the skies when Batman arrives. As Batman finds out, he's no easy foe to bring down. Meanwhile, Bruce meets up with Mayor Grange, who tells him that he's going to have to give his father's charity work to GothCorp instead of Wayne Enterprises. \n\nEpisode 8 - &quot;Q&amp;A&quot;\nArthur Brown, a former child prodigy now calling himself Cluemaster, plans revenge upon the people involved in the &quot;Think Thank Thunk&quot; game show for letting his opponent win years ago.

Batman tries to stop the puppet and his lackeys. Meanwhile, Alfred plays matchmaker for Bruce. \n\nEpisode 10 - &quot;Topsy Turvey&quot;\nJoker is out of Arkham. He's going after everyone responsible for getting him arrested, turning them into playing cards ... with Batman being his main target. \n\nEpisode 11 - &quot;Bird of Prey&quot;\nPenguin is jealous of Bruce Wayne's wealth and breaks into Wayne Manor. He kidnaps Alfred and ransacks the place while Bruce is doing an interview. Batman arrives to help right in time, only to get chained up by Penguin as well. Can Batman find a way out of this crazy mess? \n\nEpisode 12 - &quot;The Rubberface of Comedy&quot;\nJoker's back in town and has a new invention, Joker putty, that can morph anything and everything into rubber or putty. Meanwhile, Chief Rojas tells his Detectives to stop both Joker and Batman once and for all, saying both of them have no place in Gotham. \n\nEpisode 13 - &quot;The Clayface of Tragedy&quot;\nLeaving off after the previous episode, Ethan transforms into the monstrous Clayface after Joker tortures him with his putty.
