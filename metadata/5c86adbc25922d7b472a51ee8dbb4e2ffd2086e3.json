The normally unflappable detective is brought on to investigate what appears to be a clean case of larceny, but soon it turns into a quagmire of blackmail and broken promises. Crossing eras and oceans, Wolfe and his trusty assistant Archie Goodwin must find the link between a lynching and a respected British peer. At stake is the life of Wolfe's beautiful young client and a million dollars.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.audioeditions.com/audio-book.cfm/title/The-Rubber-Band/pcode/N65527&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.audioeditions.com/audio-book.cfm/title/The-Rubber-Band/pcode/N65527&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c86adbc25922d7b472a51ee8dbb4e2ffd2086e3","amp;dn":"Rex+Stout+-+the+Rubber+Band+%28nw03%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c86adbc25922d7b472a51ee8dbb4e2ffd2086e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,134,173,188,37,146,45,123,71,42,81,238,141,187,78,47,253,32,134,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
