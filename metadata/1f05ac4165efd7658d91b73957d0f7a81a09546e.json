The first thing you will notice when you play the game is that every single opponent you face is bigger than you. But thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s okay because with the skills you will build and some armour that you will purchase through upgrades, you can hope that will take them down. The game is presented in the third-person. You wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be able move your character around the arena. You are stationary with options to attack, dodge, block and parry. I can see some users complaining about this system but it works well for the game\n\nYou use gestures to make your attacks, by swiping across the screen. But this game is more about dodging, and blocking then just going crazy with the swipes. You can dodge by pressing either a left or right button on each side of the screen. You can block with your shield but each attack will take shield points based on the type of attack. You begin with only10 shield points but you can upgrade with better armour or potions.\n\nThe game tends to be easy at the beginning but becomes difficult quite quickly. The attacks become more difficult to predict and harder to avoid. You have potions during the game to regain health, attack and shield to help win the match but you must use them wisely.\n\nThis is one of the best looking playbook apps that is coming out. It has solid game play and is tons of fun. For people looking for a good fight you should defiantly keep an eye out for this playbook apps.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f05ac4165efd7658d91b73957d0f7a81a09546e","amp;dn":"Blackberry+Playbook+Game+-+Blood+And+Glory+Android","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f05ac4165efd7658d91b73957d0f7a81a09546e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,5,172,65,101,239,215,101,141,145,183,57,87,208,247,168,26,9,84,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
