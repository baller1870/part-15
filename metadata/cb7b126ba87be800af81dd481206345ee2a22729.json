It is current as of Febuary, 2010. None of these scans are new, but I thought it might be convenient for others to have them all in one place and clearly labeled. I was unable to find the new Beastmen codex for WFB, so I included the old one instead.\n\nContents:\n40k:\n  5th Edition 40k Rulebook.pdf\n  Apocalypse.pdf\n  Apocalypse Reload.pdf\n  Cities of Death.pdf\n  Planetstrike\n  Codecies:\n    Black Templars - 4th.pdf\n    Blood Angels - 4th.pdf\n    Chaos Daemons - 4th.pdf\n    Chaos Space Marines - 4th.pdf\n    Daemon Hunters - 3rd.pdf\n    Dark Angels - 4th.pdf\n    Dark Eldar - 3rd.pdf\n    Eldar - 4th.pdf\n    Imperial Guard - 5th.pdf\n    Necrons - 3rd.pdf\n    Orks - 4th.pdf\n    Space Marines - 5th, low quality.pdf\n    Space Wolves - 5th.pdf\n    Tau - 4th.pdf\n    Tyranids - 5th.pdf\n    Witch Hunters - 3rd.pdf\nWFB:\n  7th Edition WFB Rulebook.pdf\n  General's Compendium.pdf\n  Skirmish.pdf\n  Warbands.pdf\n  Army Books:\n    Beasts of Chaos - 6th.pdf\n    Bretonnia - 6th.pdf\n    Daemons of Chaos - 7th.pdf\n    Dark Elves - 7th.pdf\n    Dwarfs - 7th.pdf\n    Empire - 7th, low quality.pdf\n    High Elves - 7th.pdf\n    Lizardmen 7th, low quality.pdf\n    Ogre Kingdoms - 6th.pdf\n    Orcs And Goblins - 7th.pdf\n    Skaven - 7th.pdf\n    Tomb Kings - 6th.pdf\n    Vampire Counts - 7th.pdf\n    Warriors of Chaos - 7th.pdf\n    Wood Elves - 6th.pdf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb7b126ba87be800af81dd481206345ee2a22729","amp;dn":"5th+40k+codecies+%26+7th+WFB+army+lists","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb7b126ba87be800af81dd481206345ee2a22729","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,123,18,107,168,123,232,0,175,129,221,72,18,6,52,94,226,162,39,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
