By some miracle he returned nine years later, and the family began to pick up the pieces of their lives.\n\nNow, in this sequel to MitchardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beloved bestseller [i]The Deep End of the Ocean[/i], the Cappadora children are grown: Ben is married and has a baby girl, Kerry is studying to be an opera singer, and neÃ¢â‚¬â„¢er-do-well older son Vincent is a fledgling filmmaker. His new documentaryÃ¢â‚¬â€focusing on five families caught in the torturous web of never knowing the fate of their abducted childrenÃ¢â‚¬â€shakes his parents to the core. As VincentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s film earns greater and greater acclaim and Beth tries to stave off a torrent of long-submerged emotions, the CappadorasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ world is rocked as BethÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest fear becomes reality. The family is soon drawn precipitously into the past, revisiting the worst moment of their livesÃ¢â‚¬â€this time with only hours to find the truth that can save a life. \n\nA spellbinding novel about family loyalty and love pushed to the limits of endurance, [i]No Time to Wave Goodbye[/i] is Jacquelyn Mitchard at her best","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e52c294e792c3d857a671adfada4a6342eece346","amp;dn":"No+Time+to+Wave+Goodbye+%28Jacquelyn+Mitchard%29+Retail+azw3+epub+%5BI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e52c294e792c3d857a671adfada4a6342eece346","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,44,41,78,121,44,61,133,122,103,26,223,173,164,166,52,46,236,227,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
