They\ndid turn in an interesting version of &quot;Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye.&quot; ~ Ron Wynn\n\n2008 digitally remastered and expanded edition of Mick Hucknall and the gang's 1987 album\nfeaturing six bonus tracks. The bonus tracks on this special edition were all only released\nas B-sides before and on 7&quot; or 12&quot; vinyl (except for the live version of 'Ev'ry Time We Say\nGoodbye' which was a B-side on their first ever CD single).
