You will never know how much enjoyment you have lost until you get to dictating your autobiography.&quot;\n\n\nThus, after dozens of false starts and hundreds of pages, Twain embarked on his &quot;Final (and Right) Plan&quot; for telling the story of his life. His innovative notion - to &quot;talk only about the thing which interests you for the moment&quot; - meant that his thoughts could range freely. The strict instruction that many of these texts remain unpublished for 100 years meant that when they came out, he would be &quot;dead, and unaware, and indifferent&quot; and that he was therefore free to speak his &quot;whole frank mind&quot;.\n\n\nThe year 2010 marks the 100th anniversary of Twain's death. In celebration of this important milestone, here, for the first time, is Mark Twain's uncensored autobiography, in its entirety, exactly as he left it. This major literary event offers the first of three volumes and presents Mark Twain's authentic and unsuppressed voice, brimming with humor, ideas, and opinions, and speaking clearly from the grave, as he intended.\n\n\nEdited by Harriet Elinor Smith and other editors of the Mark Twain Project.\n\n\nMark Twain (1835 - 1910) was born Samuel L. Clemens in the town of Florida, Missouri. One of the most popular and influential authors our nation has ever produced, his keen wit and incisive satire earned him praise from both critics and peers. He has been called not only the greatest humorist of his age but the father of American literature.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a0a7769ffa627c051268047a6b5d7b8c64105a7","amp;dn":"Autobiography+Of+Mark+Twain+Volume+1+%282010%29+Read+by+Grover+Garde","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a0a7769ffa627c051268047a6b5d7b8c64105a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,10,119,105,255,166,39,192,81,38,128,71,166,181,215,184,198,65,5,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
