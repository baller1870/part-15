Recorded live.&quot;\n\nEamonn Walker          Othello\nTim McInnerny,         Iago\nZoe Tapper,            Desdemona\nZawe Ashton,           Bianca\nNick Barber,           Cassio\nLorraine Burroughs,    Aemelia\nSam Crane,             Roderigo\n\n\nDirected for the stage by  Wilson Milam\nDirected for the screen by Derek Bailey \n\nSummary \n   Desdemona defies her father to marry the Moor of Venice, the mighty warrior, Othello. But Othello's old lieutenant, Iago, doesn't like Othello, and is determined to bring about the downfall of Othello's new favorite, Cassio, and destroy Othello in the process, by casting aspersions on Othello's new bride.\n\nMy notes\n\n   Heritage Theatre was one of the first production companies to bring plays at the Globe to the larger world of video.  In viewing the whole collection from Globe Theatre On Screen one can see how the productions have incorporated more theatre elements in the design of the stage.  \n\n   Viewers of American television will recognize Eamonn Walker from the series on prison life called &quot;Oz&quot; which ran on HBO for 6 years.  His film and television career is extensive.  Sam Crane later appears as a lead in the Globe's &quot;All's Well That Ends Well.&quot;  Other of the players have changed over the years and these two are the only faces that were familiar to me.\n\n   Tragedy is more difficult to play than comedy.  But even here the performance begins with something very familiar involving the musicians which I had to think about for a bit even after seeing it a couple of times.  Where did I hear that familiar musical refrain?\n      \n\n  Notes written October 3, 2013\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf1f19b985381d5ba0fa944306901740efa692fd","amp;dn":"Shakespeares+Globe+Theatre+on+Screen+Othello++%282007%29++produced+b","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf1f19b985381d5ba0fa944306901740efa692fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,31,25,185,133,56,29,91,160,250,148,67,6,144,23,64,239,166,146,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
