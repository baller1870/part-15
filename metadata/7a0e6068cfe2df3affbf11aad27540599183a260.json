Lay Me Down In Tennessee\n\nCredits:\n\nProducer: Tucker Martine\n\nFor the five members of Black PrairieÃ¢â‚¬â€all of whom come from well-established acts such as the Decemberists and DoloreanÃ¢â‚¬â€the band is an experimental melting pot. Letting loose its weird curiosities, the Portland group explores the possibilities of standard acoustic instruments while also utilizing some that are less common, like the dobro, bazouki and archtop guitar.\n\nAlthough signed to the traditional bluegrass label Sugar Hill Records, Black Prairie isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really a bluegrass band. With influences ranging from Eastern European folk to rootsy Americana, and with half an albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth of instrumental tracks, the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second record, A Tear in the Eye Is a Wound in the Heart, ebbs and flows like a film score. \n\nInstrumental tracks such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Evil LeavesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“34 Wishes: The Legend OfÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ show songwriters capable of compelling, near-classical arrangements. Other songs, like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rock of AgesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“What You Gave,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ center on singer-violinist Annalisa TornfeltÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s countrified vocals, blending Alison KraussÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ sweetness with Patty GriffinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s earnestness. The two styles, however, often feel disconnected from song to song. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s difficult not to imagine what these musicians could do within a more cohesive narrative.\n\nIn the moments when the compositional artistry complements the vocals, the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s possibilities feel endless. The seductive Ã¢â‚¬Å“How Do You Ruin Me?,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ one of the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s darker tracks, places TornfeltÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s simple, echoing vocals against flurries of accordion, percussion, bass and violin, which weave in and out of focus.\n\n\nWhile thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no denying that, separately, all its parts are strong, the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sprawling creativity could use a filter. But then, that might defeat the purpose of Black PrairieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s existence. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a0e6068cfe2df3affbf11aad27540599183a260","amp;dn":"Black+Prairie+-+A+Tear+In+The+Eye+Is+A+Wound+In+The+Heart+%5B2012%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a0e6068cfe2df3affbf11aad27540599183a260","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,14,96,104,207,226,223,58,255,191,17,170,210,117,64,89,145,131,162,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
