Multiply that a couple of hundred times and you generate a healthy flow of checks, week in, week out. Between fake choking gigs, Victor works at Colonial Dunsboro with a motley group of losers and stoners trapped in 1734, cruises sex addiction groups for action (&quot;You put 20 sexaholics around a table night after night and don't be surprised&quot;), and visits his mother, whose anarchic streak made his childhood a mad whirl and whose Alzheimer's disease now hides what may be the startling truth about his (possibly divine?) parentage. An antihero for our deranging times, Victor finds that his whole existence is a struggle to wrest an identity from overwhelming forces. His creator, Chuck Palahniuk, is the visionary we need and the satirist we deserve.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8e027c9547624efc95a914d1c31aac0d92d5f09","amp;dn":"Choke+by+Chuck+Palahniuk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8e027c9547624efc95a914d1c31aac0d92d5f09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,224,39,201,84,118,36,239,201,90,145,77,28,49,170,192,217,45,95,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
