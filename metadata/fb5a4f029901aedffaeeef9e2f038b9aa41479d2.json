Yet they continued to strive to achieve their dreams against all odds, to the detriment of their personal lives and at the cost of some of their marriages.\n\nEddie Izzard comments: &quot;I feel very privileged to be playing the role of Robert Watson-Watt. Hopefully our production will allow him, along with Skip Wilkins and the team, to finally take their places in the pantheon of British greats of World War Two as the inventors of Radar. Without Radar the Nazis would probably have been able to invade and occupy our country. So the future of the free world may well have been saved by these unlikely men and their brilliant work leading up to the Battle of Britain. Their names are not famous - that is a mistake Britain must rectify. This is their story\n \n \n\n\n\n============= What's In This Torrent =============\n\n[b]\n\nCastles In The Sky (1x90 Minutes)\n\nSearch War Slimoo for more of my War Torrents\n \n\n[/b]\n\n===================== General =====================\nComplete name               : Castles In The Sky.avi\nFormat                      : AVI\nFormat info                 : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                   : 1.09 GB\nDuration (ms)               : 1h 29mn\nTotal bitrate               : 1 758 Kbps\nEncoded application         : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nEncoded library             : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\n===================== Video =====================\nId                          : 0\nFormat                      : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile              : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings - BVOP      : No\nFormat settings - QPel      : No\nFormat settings - GMC       : No warppoints\nFormat settings - Matrix    : Custom\nCodec Id                    : XVID\nCodec                       : XviD\nDuration (ms)               : 1h 29mn\nBitrate                     : 1 558 Kbps\nWidth                       : 704 pixels\nHeight                      : 400 pixels\nAspect ratio                : 16:9\nFramerate                   : 25.000 fps\nColorimetry                 : YUV\nColos space                 : 4:2:0\nBit depth                   : 8 bits\nScan type                   : Progressive\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.221\nStream size                 : 993 MB (89%)\nEncoded library             : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nId                          : 1\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFormat version              : Version 1\nFormat profile              : Layer 2\nCodec Id                    : 50\nDuration (ms)               : 1h 29mn\nBitrate mode                : Constant\nBitrate                     : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nSampling rate               : 48.0 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nStream size                 : 122 MB (11%)\nAlignement                  : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave duration         : 80 ms (2.00 video frames)\nInterleave preload          : 504 ms\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb5a4f029901aedffaeeef9e2f038b9aa41479d2","amp;dn":"Castles+In+The+Sky+-+War+Drama+-+Eddie+Izzard+-+Xvid+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb5a4f029901aedffaeeef9e2f038b9aa41479d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,90,79,2,153,1,174,223,250,238,239,158,47,3,139,154,164,20,121,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
