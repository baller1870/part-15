The film was practically finished by the end of 2008,and this allowed Foster to watch the whole film before writing the novelization, although the novel contains scenes absent from the film's final edit.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:383a8c0ea463bd73116c157bef89e281572df2df","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+Movie+Tie-In+-+Alan+Dean+Foster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"383a8c0ea463bd73116c157bef89e281572df2df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,58,140,14,164,99,189,115,17,108,21,123,239,137,226,129,87,45,242,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
