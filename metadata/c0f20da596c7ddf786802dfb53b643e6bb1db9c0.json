In between, of course, he was an integral part of Miles Davis&amp;#039;s legendary sextet. Spurred by a rhythm section of bassist Sam Jones and drummer Philly Joe Jones, Bill Evans shows amazing versatility on these sides: his playing on &quot;Minority,&quot; &quot;Night and Day,&quot; and &quot;Oleo&quot; is surprisingly robust and even bluesy at times--certainly not adjectives usually associated with the cool pianist. He&amp;#039;s delightfully playful on the midtempo &quot;Tenderly.&quot; Then there are the slow, meditative numbers for which he&amp;#039;s known, including three unaccompanied showcases. &quot;Peace Piece,&quot; which was actually conceived merely as an introduction to Leonard Bernstein&amp;#039;s &quot;Some Other Time,&quot; is the most famous, but his reading of another Bernstein song, &quot;Lucky to Be Me,&quot; is equally mesmerizing. Although the original record dropped it, the CD reissue does include a version of &quot;Some Other Time,&quot; complete with the &quot;Peace Piece&quot; intro.\n\nPersonnel:\nBill Evans - piano\nPhilly Joe Jones - drums\nSam Jones - bass\n\nTrack listing:\n1.
