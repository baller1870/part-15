(AMG)\n\n\n\n\nWith their dueling guitar leads and harmonies built on a double drummer foundation, the Allman Brothers Band cast the mold for the southern rock sound that would proliferate in the '70s. Virtuoso musicians, their songs drew upon a number of southern influences, including country, the blues, New Orleans jazz, and even gospel, creating a sound that was distinctly theirs. \nDecade of Hits is a great catalog of the Allman's at their guitar wielding best. The sweet, infectious harmonies on the instrumental &quot;Jessica&quot; have become a classic reference point in themselves. Next to the tragedies that plagued them--two motorcycle deaths, heroin addiction--the Allman's are probably best known for the heroic &quot;Ramblin' Man.&quot; Written and sung by the now legendary Dickey Betts, the song contained everything that made the band great: intricate guitar harmonies, a strong melody, and just enough twang to keep the thing tight. \nDecade also contains Allman staples &quot;Melissa,&quot; &quot;In Memory of Elizabeth Reed,&quot; and &quot;Southbound.&quot; (Amazon)\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img254.imageshack.us/img254/1694/folderdk.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img254.imageshack.us/img254/1694/folderdk.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n01.
