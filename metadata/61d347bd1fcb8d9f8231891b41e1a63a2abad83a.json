In this primer on leadership and innovation, the author will introduce readers to concepts like the &quot;DRI&quot; (Apple's practice of assigning a Directly Responsible Individual to every task) and the Top 100 (an annual ritual in which 100 up-and-coming executives are tapped a la Skull &amp; Bones for a secret retreat with company founder Steve Jobs).\n\nBased on numerous interviews, the book offers exclusive new information about how Apple innovates, deals with its suppliers and is handling the transition into the Post Jobs Era. Lashinsky, a Senior Editor at Large for Fortune, knows the subject cold: In a 2008 cover story for the magazine entitled The Genius Behind Steve: Could Operations Whiz Tim Cook Run The Company Someday he predicted that Tim Cook, then an unknown, would eventually succeed Steve Jobs as CEO.\n\nWhile Inside Apple is ostensibly a deep dive into one, unique company (and its ecosystem of suppliers, investors, employees and competitors), the lessons about Jobs, leadership, product design and marketing are universal. They should appeal to anyone hoping to bring some of that Apple magic to their own company, career, or creative endeavor.\n\nPLZ SEED AFTER DOWNLOADING..\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;\n\nif u like my releases, then plz add +rep to me in this link.\n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=277915&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=277915&lt;/a&gt;\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61d347bd1fcb8d9f8231891b41e1a63a2abad83a","amp;dn":"Inside+Apple-How+America%5C%27s+Most+Admired+and+Secretive+Company+R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61d347bd1fcb8d9f8231891b41e1a63a2abad83a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,211,71,189,31,203,141,159,130,49,137,27,65,225,166,58,42,186,216,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
