Known as sohei ('monk warriors') or yamabushi ('mountain warriors'), the warrior monks were anything but peaceful and meditative, and were a formidable enemy, armed with their distinctive, long-bladed naginata. The fortified cathedrals of the Ikko-ikki rivalled Samurai castles, and withstood long sieges. This title follows the daily life, training, motivation and combat experiences of the warrior monks from their first mention in AD 949 through to their suppression by the Shogunate in the years following the Sengoku-jidai period.\n\n# Paperback: 64 pages\n# Publisher: Osprey Publishing (May 20, 2003)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1841765732\n# ISBN-13: 978-1841765730","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9324b95d417aab1cf027daeedebf2ccf86c0c614","amp;dn":"Japanese+Warrior+Monks+AD+949-1603+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9324b95d417aab1cf027daeedebf2ccf86c0c614","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,36,185,93,65,122,171,28,240,39,218,238,222,191,44,207,134,192,198,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
