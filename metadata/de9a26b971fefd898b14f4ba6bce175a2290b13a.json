Day refused; Reagan loved the script and considered coming out of retirement for her first acting role in more than 40 years, but decided instead to stay home and care for her husband, Ronald Reagan, who was suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Brooks then asked his good friend Carrie Fisher if she could send the script to her mother, Debbie Reynolds, who accepted the part.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de9a26b971fefd898b14f4ba6bce175a2290b13a","amp;dn":"Mother+%281996%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de9a26b971fefd898b14f4ba6bce175a2290b13a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,154,38,185,113,254,253,137,139,20,244,186,107,206,23,90,34,144,177,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
