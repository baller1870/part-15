Perhaps it's the fact that it was Jagger's 29th birthday that made such a difference. The energy and delivery of the performance is captured in an incredible &quot;line&quot; soundboard stereo recording. The &quot;wide&quot; stereo separation features Richards and keyboards on the left, Taylor on the right, drums and vocal in the middle, and horns split between the two channels.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4081fbbd418097e401301042cd35cc422ae82e53","amp;dn":"Rolling+Stones+-+Wel+New+York+%5Blive+1972%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4081fbbd418097e401301042cd35cc422ae82e53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,129,251,189,65,128,151,228,1,48,16,66,205,53,204,66,42,232,46,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
