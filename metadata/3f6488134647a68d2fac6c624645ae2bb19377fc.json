It was executive-produced by Adrian Malone, produced by David Kennard, Geoffrey Haines-Stiles, and Gregory Andorfer, and directed by the producers, David Oyster, Richard Wells, Tom Weidlinger, and others. It covers a wide range of scientific subjects, including the origin of life and a perspective of our place in the universe.\n\nThe series was first broadcast by the Public Broadcasting Service in 1980, and was the most widely watched series in the history of American public television until The Civil War (1990). As of 2009, it was still the most widely watched PBS series in the world.[1] It won an Emmy and a Peabody Award, and has since been broadcast in more than 60 countries and seen by over 500 million people.[2][3] A book was also published to accompany the series.\n\nCosmos was produced in 1978 and 1979 by former Los Angeles PBS affiliate KCET on a roughly $6.3 million budget, with over $2 million additionally allocated to promotion. The program's format is similar to earlier BBC documentaries such as Kenneth Clark's Civilisation, Jacob Bronowski's The Ascent of Man, and David Attenborough's Life on Earth. However, unlike those series, which were shot entirely on film, Cosmos used videotape for interior scenes and special effects, with film being used for exteriors. The BBCÃ¢â‚¬â€a co-producer of CosmosÃ¢â‚¬â€later screened the series, but the episodes were cut to fit 50-minute slots.\nSagan in the series' final episode, &quot;Who Speaks for Earth?&quot;\n\nThe series is notable for its groundbreaking use of special effects, which allow Sagan to seemingly walk through environments that are actually models rather than full-sized sets. The soundtrack includes pieces of music provided by Greek composer Vangelis, such as Alpha, Pulstar, and Heaven and Hell Part 1 (the last movement serves as the signature theme music for the show, and is directly referenced by the title of the fourth episode). Throughout the 13 hours of the series, many tracks from several 1970s albums are used, such as Albedo 0.39, Spiral, Ignacio, Beaubourg, and China. The worldwide success of the documentary series put Vangelis' music in the homes of many, and brought it to the attention of a global audience.\n\nTurner Home Entertainment purchased Cosmos from series producer KCET in 1989. In making the move to commercial television, the hour-long episodes were edited to shorter lengths, and Sagan shot new epilogues for several episodes, in which he discussed new discoveriesÃ¢â‚¬â€and alternate viewpointsÃ¢â‚¬â€that had arisen since the original broadcast. A 14th episode, consisting of an interview between Sagan and Ted Turner, was also produced. This new version of the series was eventually released as a VHS box set. This same re-edited version was also released on 12&quot; Laserdisc, a popular consumer format at the time, and precursor to the DVD. Two episodes were released per disc, one episode on each side. The laserdiscs were sold separately, not in a box set like the VHS tapes.\n\nCosmos was unavailable for many years after its initial release because of copyright issues with the soundtrack music, but when it was released in 2000 on worldwide NTSC DVD, subtitles in seven languages[5] and remastered 5.1 sound were included, as well as an alternate music and sound effects track. In 2005, The Science Channel rebroadcast the series for its 25th anniversary, with updated computer graphics and film footage, digital sound, and information about relevant scientific discoveries in the intervening 25 years. Despite being shown again on the Science Channel, the total amount of time for the original 13 episodes (780 minutes) was reduced 25% to 585 minutes (45 minutes per episode) in order to make room for commercials.[6][7][8]\n\nIn 2009, Fremantle Media Enterprises released a five-disc DVD set of the original series in the UK, including bonus science updates. The DVD set was digitally restored and remastered.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f6488134647a68d2fac6c624645ae2bb19377fc","amp;dn":"Cosmos+-Carl+Sagan+%281980%29+%5BE01-E13%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f6488134647a68d2fac6c624645ae2bb19377fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,100,136,19,70,71,166,141,47,172,108,98,70,69,174,43,177,147,119,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
