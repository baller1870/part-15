Brodie (associate producer)\n\nWritten by Rose Troche, Guinevere Turner\n\nStarring: Guinevere Turner, V.S. Brodie, T. Wendy McMillan, Anastasia Sharp, Migdalia Melendez\n\n\nMax (Turner) is a young lesbian student in Chicago who&amp;#039;s gone ten months without having sex. She and her roommate Kia (McMillan) are in a coffee shop when they run into Ely (Brodie), a hippieish woman with long braided hair, whom Max initially dismisses. Max and Ely do end up going to a movie together. After the movie they return to Ely&amp;#039;s place and, after some flirtatious conversation, they kiss. Suddenly a call comes in from Ely&amp;#039;s (unseen on-screen) partner Kate, with whom Ely has been in a long-distance relationship for more than two years, which puts a bit of a damper on things.\n\nEly decides to cut off all her hair, ending up with a very short butch style. She runs into Max in a bookstore and Max almost doesn&amp;#039;t recognize her.\n\nKia&amp;#039;s girlfriend Evy (Melendez) returns home. Her ex-boyfriend Junior is there. Evy&amp;#039;s mother confronts her, saying that Junior told her that he had spotted Evy at a gay bar. Evy&amp;#039;s mother kicks her out and Evy flees to Kia&amp;#039;s place and Max invites her to live with them.\n\nEly and her roommate Daria (Sharp) throw a dinner party and, after a spirited game of I Never, Max and Ely reconnect. They make plans to go out again and then begin making out. They have several phone conversations, in the course of which Ely reveals that she&amp;#039;s &quot;sort of broken up&quot; with Kate. They get together for a second date but they never make it out of the apartment. Max ends up trimming Ely&amp;#039;s fingernails. This turns into foreplay and they have sex. Intercut with the closing credits are shots and short scenes of Max and Ely&amp;#039;s burgeoning relationship.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Go-Fish-Guinevere-Turner/dp/B00005BKZK&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Go-Fish-Guinevere-Turner/dp/B00005BKZK&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nVideo:\nResolution: 448x336 (4/3)\nFPS: 23,98\nBitRate: 1074 Kbps\nQuality Factor: 0,30 b/px\nCodec: XviD MPEG-4\n\nAudio:\nNumber of channels: 2\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\nBitRate: 104 Kbps\nCodec: MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3ca44e26c9944299bb1e53e76b48eb2db235e12","amp;dn":"Go.Fish.DVDRip.Xvid-TBMs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3ca44e26c9944299bb1e53e76b48eb2db235e12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,202,68,226,108,153,68,41,155,177,229,62,118,180,142,178,219,35,94,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
