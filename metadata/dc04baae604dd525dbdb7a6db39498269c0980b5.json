With uncooperative actors, technical problems, and of course swarms of mosquitos, the project they went there to film quickly goes downhill. Brandon, the camera man, starts noticing strange things on the tapes, and people start acting weird. Could the people of Bonville have something to hide?\n\nIn this found-footage horror movie from the indie studio Vince Emerson Media, you'll get 94 minutes of horror, suspense, humour, and action. After the feature film, watch the half-hour &quot;making-of&quot; featurette and a selection of extended scenes.\n\nBased on the Internet urban legend of the &quot;Slender Man&quot;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2272756/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2272756/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRatings: 4.9/10 from 57 users \n\n\nRuntime: 93 min","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc04baae604dd525dbdb7a6db39498269c0980b5","amp;dn":"windigo+%26quot%3Bslender-man+movie%26quot%3B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc04baae604dd525dbdb7a6db39498269c0980b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,4,186,174,96,77,213,37,219,219,122,109,179,148,152,38,156,9,128,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
