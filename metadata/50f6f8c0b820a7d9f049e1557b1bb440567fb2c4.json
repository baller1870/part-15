The development team at LucasArts is bringing the game into the modern era with an all new re-imagined contemporary art style, a re-mastered musical score, full voiceover, and an in-depth hint system to help players through the gameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s side-splitting puzzles. Purists will also delight in the ability to seamlessly switch between the updated hand-drawn re-imagining and the original classic version. The game's twisty plot leads our naive hero on a hilarious, swash-buckling search for the fabled secret of Monkey Island. Tales of pirate wealth lure him to the port of Melee with high hopes, no money, and insatiable curiosity. If clever enough, he will win the confidence of Melee's pirates and find himself blown by the winds of fate toward the terrifying and legendary Monkey Island -- an adventure that would chill the bones of even the most bloodthirsty buccaneer.Relive the swashbuckling humorous misadventures of the wannabe pirate Guybrush Threepwood\n\n\n\nInstall Notes\n\n\n\nSystem Requirements\n\n\n\nMinimum Configuration:\n\n\n\n*** OS: Windows XP or Windows Vista\n\n*** Processor: Intel Pentium 4 3GHz or AMD Athlon 64 3000+\n\n*** Memory: 256 MB RAM, 512 MB for Vista\n\n*** Graphics: 128 MB with Shader Model 2.0 capability\n\n*** DirectX: 9.0c (March 2009)\n\n*** Hard Drive: 2.5GB free hard drive space\n\n*** Sound: DirectX 9.0c compliant sound card\n\n*** Controller support: Xbox 360 controller\n\n\n  (1.
