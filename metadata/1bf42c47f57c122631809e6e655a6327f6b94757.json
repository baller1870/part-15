A/V quality is good.\r\n\r\nThe [a.f.k.] translation is superior to the official DVDs, and the show was designed to be broadcast out of chronological order.  However, the DVDs moved the episodes into chronological order, and the torrents collecting Season 1 and Season 2 of &quot;Haruhi&quot; mix them together into chronological order too, which I think messes them up.\r\n\r\nI wanted to upload this to preserve the easy ability to watch Season 1 in broadcast order, and separately from Season 1, since keeping them separate is a much better way of watching the show.  Plus, being able to point people at a pair of torrents is much simpler than trying to explain what order to move the episodes into.\r\n \r\nThis is a win for both laziness and curation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bf42c47f57c122631809e6e655a6327f6b94757","amp;dn":"%5Ba.f.k.%5D+The+Melancholy+of+Haruhi+Suzumiya+-+Season+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bf42c47f57c122631809e6e655a6327f6b94757","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,244,44,71,245,124,18,38,49,128,158,110,101,90,99,39,246,185,71,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
