The event depicts a storm which hits the towns of Stoolbend, Quahog and Langley Falls. It was originally scheduled to air May 1, but a series of tornadoes killing many people in the South prompted Fox to postpone the episodes for the following season. It has since aired October 2, 2011.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bd105b2a102cf4c212434026584638a03b9fb83","amp;dn":"Animation+Domination+Crossover+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bd105b2a102cf4c212434026584638a03b9fb83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,209,5,178,161,2,207,76,33,36,52,2,101,132,99,138,3,185,251,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
