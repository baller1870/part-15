His brother Andrej (Vlado Mueller) is the businessman who has the confidence his brother lacks but is troubled by his strained marriage to his wife. Juraj falls for his brother's wife, while Andrej falls for Juraj's girl Jana (Jana Hernova), but Andrej's death in a car crash puts an end to the two unconventional love affairs. The appeal of the film is the interaction of the two brothers that strikes a resounding note of familiarity to any audience.
