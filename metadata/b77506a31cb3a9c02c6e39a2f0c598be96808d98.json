Northumberland), bassist William Potter (b. Derby), and drummer Steve Goodwin (b. Croydon, Surrey). Though an indie rock band, their music incorporated elements of funk. They were critically acclaimed throughout their career, but never broke through to a mainstream UK record-buying audience. Perhaps this was in part due to their eccentric lyrical concerns, which occasionally led to their dismissal as somewhat of a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œjokeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ band. CUD are also regarded by some as one of the most underrated bands from the British music scene in the last 20 years. Sexy rhythms and memorable sparky lyrics. The music press hated them, the fanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get enough of em!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b77506a31cb3a9c02c6e39a2f0c598be96808d98","amp;dn":"Cud+-+Showbiz+%281994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b77506a31cb3a9c02c6e39a2f0c598be96808d98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,117,6,163,28,179,169,192,44,110,57,162,240,197,152,190,150,128,141,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
