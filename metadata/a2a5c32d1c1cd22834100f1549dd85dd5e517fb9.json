Not even the       \n    heavily-armoured stegosaurus was safe from this killer,   \n    and incredible evidence reveals a glimpse of a vicious     \n    battle between these two giants.                          \n                                                             \n    Life in Jurassic oceans was no easier; in 2008, a         \n    fossil was dug out of a frozen island high in the          \n    Arctic. It was a colossal marine reptile, twice as big    \n    as most ocean predators, at 15 metres long and weighing  \n    about 45 tonnes. This was Predator X. Its skull alone     \n    was nearly twice the size of a tyrannosaurus rex's, and    \n    its bite force unmatched by anything in the Jurassic      \n    seas.                                                    \n                                                              \n    The balance of power between predator and prey is a        \n    fine one, as prey continually evolve different ways to    \n    avoid predators. But for the most successful and         \n    enduring predators, the battle to survive has always      \n    been tipped in their favour.                               \n                                                              \n                                                               \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n           &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b015pbw7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b015pbw7&lt;/a&gt;           \n                                                              \n            Done at CRF 18 due to content and type.          \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2a5c32d1c1cd22834100f1549dd85dd5e517fb9","amp;dn":"Planet.Dinosaur.S01E04.Fight.for.Life.720p.HDTV.x264-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2a5c32d1c1cd22834100f1549dd85dd5e517fb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,165,195,45,28,28,210,40,52,16,15,21,73,221,133,221,94,81,127,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
