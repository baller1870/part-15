Maybe it's the novelty of seeing V-Ice trying to act for the first time.  :D ....or, perhaps you lived through the early 90's wearing the same fluro pants.  :o Who knows? For me, these were great times and watching this movie brings back all the great memories! Either way, treat this movie more as a curiosity and be prepared for some real &quot;.....ah what?!&quot; corniness. Gotta Love The Ice-Man! \n\nABOUT THIS RIP\n\nOK, here's the deal. You've no doubt seen other versions of this movie being torrented about, which are mainly VHS or Laserdisc converts. These aren't too bad. The Laserdisc version being the best. \nAnyway, there is also a Widescreen 720p HDTV version which is awesome quality. In fact, close to DVD quality you're ever going to get hence the reason I've listed it as a &quot;DVDrip&quot;. I'm guessing there will be a proper DVD release of this movie very soon!\nAnyway, I have converted it to a smaller AVI file. I know the file size (1.78gb) may seem big, but I wanted to maintain as much quality close to the original as possible at 720x400 res. A 700mb file just doesn't cut it!\n \nI've tried many conversion type programs using the same settings and all failed dismally in quality except one .&quot;Any DVD Converter Pro&quot; gave an awesome result!\nYou certainly won't be dissappointed with this version!\nConverts to DVD using programs like &quot;ConvertxtoDVD&quot; or &quot;NERO&quot; very well.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db7c21a08b1c48e908ea1f6a08a14a3408da3e3a","amp;dn":"Vanilla+Ice+-+Cool+As+Ice+%28HDTV%29+Movie+1991","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db7c21a08b1c48e908ea1f6a08a14a3408da3e3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,124,33,160,139,28,72,233,8,234,31,106,8,161,74,52,8,218,62,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
