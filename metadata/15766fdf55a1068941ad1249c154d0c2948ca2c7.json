The album was released in December 1971 and \nquickly rose to the top of the charts. It features songs such as &quot;It's Going to Take Some Time&quot; \n(US #12 by The Carpenters) &quot;Sweet Seasons,&quot; a #9 hit for Carole King, and &quot;Brother, Brother&quot;.\n\nCarole King: Music experienced immediate success and was certified gold on December 9, 1971, days after\nrelease. It was certified platinum on July 17, 1995.\n\nMusic entered the top ten at #8, becoming the first of many weeks both Tapestry and Carole King: Music \nwould occupy the top ten simultaneously. The album hit #1 on New Year's Day 1972 and stayed there for \nthree consecutive weeks.\n\nThis time Carole King plays the piano and celeste on many tracks.\n\nCarole King (born February 9, 1942) is an American singer, songwriter, and pianist. King and her former \nhusband Gerry Goffin wrote more than two dozen chart hits for numerous artists during the 1960s, many of \nwhich have become standards. As a singer, her Tapestry album topped the U.S. album chart for 15 weeks in \n1971, and remained on the charts for more than six years.\n\nShe was most successful as a performer in the first half of the 1970s, although she was a successful \nsongwriter long before and long after. She had her first No. 1 hit as a songwriter in 1961 at age 18, with \nWill You Love Me Tomorrow, which she wrote with Gerry Goffin. In 1997, she co-wrote The Reason for \nAerosmith, but instead it was sung by Celine Dion.\n\n\n   1. Carole King - Brother, Brother                          [03:00]\n   2.
