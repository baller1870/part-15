Excited and not a little scared, they packed up their three childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ages two, four, and sevenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and headed for adventure and uncertainty in Beijing, China.\n\nBased on his award-winning Wall Street Journal Online column, &quot;The Expat Life,&quot; Big in China explores Paul's unlikely three-and-a-half-year journey of reinvention in this rapidly developing metropolis. He reveals the challenges that he and his family faced while living in a foreign land, including reaching beyond the expat community, coming to terms with his new role as a stay-at-home dad, and learning to navigate and thrive in an unfamiliar culture. By viewing an intimidating challenge as a golden opportunity rather than as a burden, he saw his world open up around him.\n\nAt the heart of the memoir is his time fronting Woodie Alan, a blues band he formed with a Chinese partner. The cross-cultural collaboration became an unlikely success. The band embarked on a tour across China, earning the title &quot;Best Band in Beijing&quot; and recording an acclaimed CD of original music sung in both English and Mandarin, which prompted ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons to say, &quot;This is the best Chinese blues band I ever heard. Who knew?&quot; Woodie Alan was symbolic of Paul's entire China experience and?proof of what transpires when one can suspend preconceived notions and plunge into a new reality. \nEnjoy and seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:633b2575ef9e118521284f4fb7b4d86eca2696d6","amp;dn":"Big+in+China.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"633b2575ef9e118521284f4fb7b4d86eca2696d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,59,37,117,239,158,17,133,33,40,79,79,183,180,216,110,202,38,150,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
