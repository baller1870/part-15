It combines stories that are fictional, with technology that is real. While none of the stories have happened, there is no reason why they could not. You could argue it provides a road map for criminal hackers, but I say it does something else: it provides a glimpse into the creative minds of some of today's best hackers, and even the best hackers will tell you that the game is a mental one.&quot; - from the Foreword to the first Stealing the Network book, How to Own the Box, Jeff Moss, Founder &amp; Director, Black Hat, Inc. and Founder of DEFCON\nFor the very first time the complete Stealing the Network epic is available in an enormous, over 1000 page volume complete with the final chapter of the saga!\nThese groundbreaking books created a fictional world of hacker superheroes and villains based on real world technology, tools, and tactics. It is almost as if the authors peered into the future as many of the techniques and scenarios in these books have come to pass.\nThis book contains all of the material from each of the four books in the Stealing the Network series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:170c81dac7c3cdb5e44ed4e9bbee01827b840c62","amp;dn":"Stealing+the+Network%3A+The+Complete+Series+Collector%5C%27s+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"170c81dac7c3cdb5e44ed4e9bbee01827b840c62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,12,129,218,199,195,205,181,228,78,212,233,187,238,1,130,123,132,12,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
