It peaked at number 29 on the U.S. charts.\n\nIn the UK, it became the fourth Black Sabbath studio-album to attain Silver certification (60,000 units sold) by the British Phonographic Industry, achieving this in February 1982.\n\nIt was the first album to feature Vinny Appice on drums, who had replaced original member Bill Ward in the middle of the tour in support of the previous year's Heaven and Hell.\n\nThe cover art is a modified version of artist Greg Hildebrandt's piece entitled Dream 1: Crucifiers from 1971, with Black Sabbath licensing its use for the cover of Mob Rules. The original artwork has been augmented for the album, where not only have the band and album names been conspicuously added to the back wall, but also the hook hanging on the left side of the structure was changed to a crucifix, and the stain in the middle of the structure has been altered to resemble a devil's head. Lastly, Greg Hildebrandt's name has been added to the bottom center of the piece, as the original was rectangular in shape with the artist's name and year in the lower left corner, thus being truncated in the album's square presentation. The lyrical themes are dark, notably on tracks such as &quot;The Sign of the Southern Cross&quot; and &quot;Falling Off the Edge of the World&quot;.\n\nThe Live Evil album was recorded on the Mob Rules tour.\n\nMob Rules - DELUXE EDITION [320k MP3]\n\nDeluxe Edition Disc 1\n\n    &quot;Turn Up the Night&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:42\n    &quot;Voodoo&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:32\n    &quot;The Sign of the Southern Cross&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:46\n    &quot;E5150&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:54\n    &quot;The Mob Rules&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:14\n    &quot;Country Girl&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:02\n    &quot;Slipping Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n    &quot;Falling Off the Edge of the World&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:02\n    &quot;Over and Over&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:28\n    &quot;Die Young (Live, 12&quot; Single B-Side of Mob Rules)\n    &quot;The Mob Rules (Heavy Metal OMPS/ Original demo version)\n\nDeluxe Edition Disc 2\n\nThis is a repackaging of the previously released Limited Edition CD Live at Hammersmith Odeon\n\n    &quot;E5150&quot; (Ronnie James Dio, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler)\n    &quot;Neon Knights&quot; (2 January 1982) (Dio, Iommi, Butler, Bill Ward)\n    &quot;N.I.B.&quot; (1 January 1982) (Ozzy Osbourne, Iommi, Butler, Ward)\n    &quot;Children of the Sea&quot; (1 January 1982) (Dio, Iommi, Butler, Ward)\n    &quot;Country Girl&quot; (1 January 1982) (Dio, Iommi, Butler)\n    &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; (31 December 1981) (Osbourne, Iommi, Butler, Ward)\n    &quot;War Pigs&quot; (1 January 1982) (Osbourne, Iommi, Butler, Ward)\n    &quot;Slipping Away&quot; (31 December 1981) (Dio, Iommi, Butler)\n    &quot;Iron Man&quot; (1 January 1981) (Osbourne, Iommi, Butler, Ward)\n    &quot;The Mob Rules&quot; (31 December 1981) (Dio, Iommi, Butler)\n    &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; (1 January 1982) (Dio, Iommi, Butler, Ward)\n    &quot;Paranoid&quot; (31 December 1981) (Osbourne, Iommi, Butler, Ward)\n    &quot;Voodoo&quot; (2 January 1982) (Dio, Iommi, Butler)\n    &quot;Children of the Grave&quot; (31 December 1981) (Osbourne, Iommi, Butler, Ward)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Ronnie James Dio ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals[5]\n    Tony Iommi ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar[5]\n    Geezer Butler ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass guitar[5]\n    Vinny Appice ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums[5]\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3ef0c676f96ce117722b0435bfc5763df701a8e","amp;dn":"Black+Sabbath+-+Mob+Rules+%5BDELUXE%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3ef0c676f96ce117722b0435bfc5763df701a8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,239,12,103,111,150,206,17,119,34,176,67,91,252,87,99,223,112,26,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
