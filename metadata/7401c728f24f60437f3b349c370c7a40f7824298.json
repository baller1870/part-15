McDonald is known for a soulful baritone[1] singing style. He began his career singing back-up vocals with Steely Dan. He became a member of The Doobie Brothers from 1976 to 1982, a period which resulted in several hit songs for the band. He has won five Grammy Awards.\n\n\nReview:\nOn one hand, Michael McDonald's new collection is an amazing collection of his best work. It gives us his duets &quot;Yah Mo B There&quot; and &quot;On My Own&quot; in the same place. The previously unreleased &quot;Higher Ground&quot; is a powerful number, and &quot;Get the Word Started&quot; is a good one from after his first hits collection &quot;Sweet Freedom-Best of&quot;. And yet most of these songs are repeats, which is understandable, since you can't forget &quot;I Keep Forgetting&quot; or &quot;By Heart.&quot; But 6 of the songs are from his &quot;No Lookin' Back&quot; album, while his recent album &quot;Blue Obsession&quot; is mentioned in the liner notes but not represented by any song on the cd. Is &quot;Bad Times&quot; essential McDonald? I would be more curious about a track from his latest album sounds like so I could see if I wanted to get it. Instead, I'm fed nearly the whole &quot;No Lookin' Back&quot; album and thus would have no need to purchase that cd for only a couple different songs. And although it's hard to cover everything McDonald did even with 16 tracks, his first solo album &quot;If That's What It Takes&quot; only scored two songs, equal to the amount from &quot;Blink of an Eye&quot; which failed to chart. In spite of these questionable inclusions and exclusions, The album has a clear sound that celebrates McDonald's unique voice. That is what I feel it raises to level of a five-star album, every song is good when McDonald sings it. And the liner notes are about 8 pages and give a biography and photos of Michael while noting trivia about the individual songs on this disc. Some would argue for marketing reasons that it's important to &quot;fill it with hits&quot; rather than show the artist's range from &quot;Ain't that Peculiar&quot; to &quot;Down by the River.&quot; And yet if they put in more reasons to check it out like the one previously unreleased &quot;Higher Ground&quot;, it would have been a more rewarding album. Nonetheless, whether seen as a former Doobie Brother, a pop hitmaker, or a pure musician, McDonald delivers the goods.\nReview By Edgar Alberts\nRate 5/5\n\nimage\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n01.
