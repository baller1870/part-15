In the shadows of Batman, the rocker turned composer cranked out scores \nthat have either earned him millions (Edward Scissorhands and The Nightmare \nBefore Christmas) or have continued to earn the quiet respect of film music \ncritics across the board (Black Beauty and Sommersby). The first &quot;Music for a \nDarkened Theatre&quot; compilation was released in 1990 just as Elfman fans were \nexperiencing the zeal of discovering a fantastic new talent in the genre, and \nthe single album contained tracks from his earliest days through Darkman, \nNightbreed, and Dick Tracy. By late 1996, Elfman had matured into a A-class \ncomposer in Hollywood and had already begun his transition from his gothic, \nsymphonic efforts to the more electronic and percussive sorts that better \nreflected his pre-orchestral scoring days. Just as Mars Attacks! was hitting the \ntheatres, Elfman released his much anticipated &quot;Music for a Darkened Theatre: \nVolume II&quot; for his fans to chew on, and the 2CD set remains one of the best \ncomposer compilations ever to be pressed commercially. The remarkable aspect of \nthese &quot;Music for a Darkened Theatre&quot; albums is that it is difficult (fiscally \nand ownership-wise) to get such massive compilations of original recordings \nreleased, and &quot;Volume II&quot; (like the first CD) presented some never-before \nreleased music in the days before bootlegged CDrs spoiled fans with access to \nsuch works. Matching his eccentric personality, the packaging of the set \nincludes bizarre photography of the composer, as well as insightful and funny \nremarks by Elfman about each section of the album. The only wide-spread \ncomplaints about the album include some curious edits of cues (and mixing of \nadjoining music) and, more importantly, the fact that the scores are not \npresented in chronological order of release. A quick rundown of both CDs \nfollows.\n\nThe first CD of the set opens with the necessary suite from Elfman's personal \nfavorite (and most fans' favorites from the composer), Edward Scissorhands. \nElfman touches on both the comedic and tragic elements of the score by ranging \nin inclusion from &quot;Barber&quot; to the absolutely essential &quot;Grand Finale.&quot; The \nlesser-known but respected Dolores Claiborne score suffers perhaps the most in \nits placement on the album, simply unable to compete with the overbearing \nemotion of Edward Scissorhands and the quirkiness of To Die For. The latter \nscore is among one of Elfman's most playful, with the juxtaposition of an \ninnocent children's chorus with rocking electric guitar rips performed by Elfman \nhimself. A bizarre roller coaster of a ride, To Die For is an important \ninclusion here if only because it will likely ward some Elfman's pre-1995 fans \naway from its complete album. Back to Elfman's tragic favorites, a generous \noffering from Black Beauty skillfully merges several cues from across the score \ninto one unsurprisingly gorgeous suite. As a nod to his Batman theme (another \npersonal favorite of his), the collection of cues from Batman Returns includes \nthe obvious pronouncements of the title theme, as well as the &quot;End Credits&quot; \nrepresentation of Penguin and Catwoman themes. The second CD offers a wider \nvariety of Elfman's production, beginning with the hot score at the time, \nMission: Impossible. While the score would be a rhythmically percussive \ndeparture from Elfman's previous action music, it's interesting to note that he \nchose to include on this album the cues that are most similar to the rest of his \nbody of work, highlighted by the &quot;Betrayal&quot; cue that tops the score in quality. \nNone of Lalo Schifrin's theme appears here (perhaps due to rights issues). By \ncontrast, Sommersby remains a hidden gem, and its lengthy suite is extremely \nwelcome on this compilation. For any fan of Elfman's tragic symphonic works, \nthis suite will send you seeking the score's original album without hesitation.\n\nAmong one of Elfman's commercially unreleased scores at the time was Dead \nPresidents, which combined with To Die For caused considerable shock for fans of \nthe composer in 1995. Among the alternately harsh and hip 1970's rock sounds \ncame the introduction of the electric base into Elfman's ensembles... a \npermanent addition. Woefully out of place on the album is The Nightmare Before \nChristmas, for which Elfman includes the three most impressive score cuts from \nthe album and unfortunately none of the songs (perhaps a rights issue once \nagain?). The unreleased score for early 1996's Freeway, a gift score from Elfman \nfor a friend, is Elfman's first improvised synthetic work, and hails back to his \n&quot;Face Like a Frog&quot; days... it's truly bizarre and sick, bordering on completely \nintolerable even to a veteran Elfman collector. The odd selection of items that \nfollows typically falls closer to this bizarre end of the spectrum, with \nShrunken Heads resembling The Nightmare Before Christmas very closely. Elfman's \n&quot;Amazing Stories&quot; cues --like those of John Williams-- are highly valued and \noffer some of Elfman's most comedic symphonic writing since Beetlejuice. The \ntheme for the 1990 Warner TV show &quot;The Flash&quot; is a playful Batman knock-off. The \nfour cues from &quot;Pee Wee's Playhouse&quot; are lower-budget renditions of the nearly \nidentical film score cues, and they can't compare to the original orchestral \nperformances. The Beetlejuice television show theme likewise will send you \nscampering for the original. The album ends with a remarkable demo of &quot;This is \nHalloween&quot; from The Nightmare Before Christmas in which Elfman confirms his \nimmense talents to the world by performing every instrument and voice himself. \nThis 2-CD set is simply unbeatable in its lengthy offerings of original \nrecordings from each of the composer's works between 1991 and 1996. With the \ncontinued movement towards diversity in Elfman's career, a third volume is \nhighly wished for by his fans, though with ten years passed without any word on \nVolume III and such a large volume of material now collected in his career, any \nhopes for such an album are slim. Even so, if Elfman can ever arrange the \nfinances and permissions necessary for Volume III, there's everything from the \nmagical Nissan commercial music from 1996 to the fifteen minutes of beautiful \nunreleased music from The Family Man to be included. Let's keep hoping...\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEAC LOGs\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDanny Elfman / Music For A Darkened Theatre (Vol.2) - Disc1\n\nUsed drive  : HL-DT-STDVD-RAM GSA-H55N   Adapter: 3  ID: 1\n\nRead mode               : Secure\nUtilize accurate stream : Yes\nDefeat audio cache      : No\nMake use of C2 pointers : No\n\nRead offset correction                      : 102\nOverread into Lead-In and Lead-Out          : No\nFill up missing offset samples with silence : Yes\nDelete leading and trailing silent blocks   : No\nNull samples used in CRC calculations       : No\nUsed interface                              : Native Win32 interface for Win NT \n&amp;
