Sound is excellent throughout, while full details on who plays what and where, along with where everything came from in the first place, all appear in exhaustive detail. \nThe liner notes, meanwhile, come from longtime funk road manager (Brown, Prince, plenty of others) Alan Leeds, explaining every step of Collins' wonderful story. Collins himself gets in a great concluding bit of thanks and message that's a joy to read, and needless to say the photos of him in his sunglassed late-'70s star-bass-guitar glory abound. \nAnd the music? &quot;Bootzilla,&quot; &quot;Stretchin' Out (In a Rubber Band),&quot; and &quot;Pinocchio Theory&quot; are just three jam masterpieces of many. A couple of fine rarities flesh things out; &quot;What So Never the Dance,&quot; recorded in 1971 when Collins' band was still known as the House Guests, is a great slice of greasy, JB-tinged funk. &quot;Body Slam!&quot; shows him getting to grips with electro nicely, while &quot;Scenery,&quot; originally a B-side ballad, has him doing his loveman-goes-nuts deal at the end. \nA fierce 1976-era live take on &quot;Psychoticbumpschool,&quot; with the Horny Horns in full blow, wraps up this fantastic collection.
