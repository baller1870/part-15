Because of her conservative upbringing, Sara rebelled with a scandalously skimpy teenage wardrobe, but now that's she about to become a stepmom to her fiancÃƒÂ©Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s three kids, her inappropriately trashy style is about to be subpoenaed. Can Sarah handle taking a hard look at herself and her style? Or will her defensive attitude drive the What Not to Wear team over the edge Ã¢â‚¬â€ Clinton actually walked out at one point!\n\nMediaInfo:\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 518 MiB\nDuration                         : 42mn 28s\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 705 Kbps\nWriting application              : Lavf52.39.0\nWriting library                  : VirtualDub build 32842/release\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : DX50\nCodec ID/Hint                    : DivX 5\nDuration                         : 42mn 28s\nBit rate                         : 1 500 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 448 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.607\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.186\nStream size                      : 456 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                  : Lavc52.36.0\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 42mn 28s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 58.3 MiB (11%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 504 ms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e2e5c2d73cf14cf8c2af6308878dd87c42723bf","amp;dn":"What.Not.To.Wear+s08e08+Sarah+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e2e5c2d73cf14cf8c2af6308878dd87c42723bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,46,92,45,115,207,20,207,140,42,246,48,136,120,221,135,196,39,35,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
