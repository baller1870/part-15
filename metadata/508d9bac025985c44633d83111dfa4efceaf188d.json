It presents the developments of advanced polyblends and respective tools to characterize and predict the material properties and behavior. The book provides important original and theoretical experimental results that use non-routine methodologies often unfamiliar to many readers. Furthermore chapters on novel applications of more familiar experimental techniques and analyses of composite problems are included, which indicate the need for the new experimental approaches that are presented.\n\nTechnical and technological development demands the creation of new materials that are stronger, more reliable, and more durableÃ¢â‚¬â€materials with new properties. Up-to-date projects in creation of new materials go along the way of nanotechnology.\n\nWith contributions from experts from both the industry and academia, this book presents the latest developments in the identified areas. This book incorporates appropriate case studies, explanatory notes, and schematics for more clarity and better understanding. The book is designed as a textbook for postgraduate students, as a teaching support for the faculty, as a reference book for early research career beginners, and as a reference book for the scientific community at large for understanding the significance of modern materials and chemical engineering. This book will be useful for chemists, chemical engineers, technologists, and students interested in advanced nano-polymers with complex behavior and their applications\n\nThis new book:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Gives an up-to-date and thorough exposition of the present state of the art of polyblends and composites\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Familiarizes the reader with new aspects of the techniques used in the examination of polymers, including chemical, physicochemical, and purely physical methods of examination\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Describes the types of techniques now available to the polymer chemist and technician and discusses their capabilities, limitations, and applications\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Provides a balance between materials science and mechanics aspects, basic and applied research, and high-technology and high-volume (low-cost) composite development","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:508d9bac025985c44633d83111dfa4efceaf188d","amp;dn":"Polymers+and+Polymeric+Composites+-+Properties%2C+Optimization%2C+an","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"508d9bac025985c44633d83111dfa4efceaf188d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,141,155,172,2,89,133,196,70,51,216,49,17,223,164,239,206,175,24,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
