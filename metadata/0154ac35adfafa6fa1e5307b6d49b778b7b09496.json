His historical mysteries have received universally high praise for the elegant details that color each chapter. The New York Times Book Review calls his works &quot;witty, pen-in-cheek&quot; adventures. \n\n  It is 1882. Oscar Wilde tours the U.S., delivering lectures on art and literature. In each city where he appears, a woman is murdered, dismembered, and flayed. Six people are traveling in WildeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s entourage. Could the monstrous killer be one of them? As a down-on-his-luck lawman investigates, he is pulled into the flamboyant world of the outspoken writer. Wilde West is a remarkable mystery, filled with quips that could easily have flowed from WildeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pen. Each character, from luscious heiresses to shadowy servants, is fully realized. And WildeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s comments on the American West are priceless, especially as voiced by Audie Award-winning narrator Frank Muller.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0154ac35adfafa6fa1e5307b6d49b778b7b09496","amp;dn":"WILDE+WEST+-+Walter+Satterthwait.+Read+Frank+Muller+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0154ac35adfafa6fa1e5307b6d49b778b7b09496","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,84,172,53,173,250,250,111,161,229,48,123,109,73,183,120,183,176,148,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
