In the space of half a century it passed from gold, to silver, to paper, and is now somewhere between plastic and navel lint.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€From The New Empire of Debt\n\nIn the last half of 2008, the Empire of Debt received the margin call from Hell. Now, all of its citizens are asked to pay up as the U.S. economy stumbles down a dangerous path of financial turmoil. What exactly went wrong?\n\nWhen things are good, people tend to believe the most outrageous thingsÃ¢â‚¬â€that the financial sector could get rich by lending money to people who couldn't pay it back, and that a whole economy could flourish by luring consumers to spend more than they could afford. These hallucinations created an immense worldwide bubble of debt and dollars. And nowÃ¢â‚¬â€with the U.S. government inflating the biggest bubble in public debt the world has ever seenÃ¢â‚¬â€a financial whirlpool has formed and threatens to drag the entire country down the drain.\n\nIn The New Empire of Debt, the internationally acclaimed author team of William Bonner and Addison Wiggin return to reveal how the epic financial bubble that is plaguing the United States will soon bring an end to this once-great empire. Throughout the book, they offer a frightening look atÃ‚Â¿the United States' precarious position and discuss how government control of the economy and financial systemÃ¢â‚¬â€combined with unfettered deficit spending and gluttonous consumptionÃ¢â‚¬â€has ravaged the business environment, devastated consumer confidence, and pushed the global economy to the brink.\n\nAlong the way, Bonner and Wiggin warn of the dangers that lie ahead and offer practical advice to protect your financial well-being as the American empire collapses upon itself. You'll discover that you don't have to tie your own fate to the inevitable destruction of America's system of imperial finance. Instead, you can take some simple steps to weather the crisis.\n\nBonner and Wiggin have been studying the financial landscape for more than twenty years. With The New Empire of Debt, they not only show you how we got into this mess, but how to get yourself out of it.
