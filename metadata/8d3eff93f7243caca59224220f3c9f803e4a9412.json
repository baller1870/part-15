At the top of her game, she retired from the music business to concentrate on a quieter domestic life. Now she's back better than ever, still collaborating with her msuical partner Danny White, and delivering fresh songs that effortlessly update the beautiful spirit, timeless melodies and latin-jazz rhythms of her greatest hits.\n\n~ Album Credits ~ \n\n:: Performance Credits :: \nBasia ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Primary Artist\nPeter White ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Guitar\nJulian Crampton ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Bass\nIan Kirkham ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Saxophone\nMark Reilly ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Background Vocals\nKevin Robinson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Trumpet, Flugelhorn, French Horn, Background Vocals\nAndy Ross ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Guitar\nFayyaz Virji ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Trombone\nMarc Parnell ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Drums\nPaul Booth ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Saxophone\nDanny White &amp; Linda Nail ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Keyboards\n\n:: Technical Credits :: \nRichard Bull ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Mastering\nBasia Trzetrzelewska ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Producer\nDanny White &amp; Linda Nail ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Producer \n\ncredits go to ProCon1 \n\n\nCheck my Basia's Discography: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4317942/Basia_and_Matt_Bianco_-_Discography_(1984-2004)_[mp3_VBR]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4317942/Basia_and_Matt_Bianco_-_Discography_(1984-2004)_[mp3_VBR]&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d3eff93f7243caca59224220f3c9f803e4a9412","amp;dn":"Basia+-+It%5C%27s+That+Girl+Again+%282009%29+%5Bmp3%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d3eff93f7243caca59224220f3c9f803e4a9412","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,62,255,147,247,36,60,172,165,146,36,34,15,60,159,128,62,74,148,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
