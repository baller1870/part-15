Ã¢â‚¬Å“Is there anything Jane Smiley cannot do?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ raves Time magazine. But in the wake of 9/11, Smiley faltered in her hitherto unflagging impulse to write and decided to approach novels from a different angle: she read one hundred of them, from classics such as the thousand-year-old Tale of Genji to recent fiction by Zadie Smith, Nicholson Baker, and Alice Munro.\n\nSmiley exploresÃ¢â‚¬â€œas no novelist has before herÃ¢â‚¬â€œthe unparalleled intimacy of reading, why a novel succeeds (or doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t), and how the novel has changed over time. She describes a novelist as Ã¢â‚¬Å“right on the cusp between someone who knows everything and someone who knows nothing,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ yet whose Ã¢â‚¬Å“job and ambition is to develop a theory of how it feels to be alive.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIn her inimitable styleÃ¢â‚¬â€œexuberant, candid, opinionatedÃ¢â‚¬â€œSmiley invites us behind the scenes of novel-writing, sharing her own habits and spilling the secrets of her craft. She walks us step-by-step through the publication of her most recent novel, Good Faith, and, in two vital chapters on how to write Ã¢â‚¬Å“a novel of your own,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ offers priceless advice to aspiring authors. \n\nThirteen Ways of Looking at the Novel may amount to a peculiar form of autobiography. We see Smiley reading in bed with a chocolate bar; mulling over plot twists while cooking dinner for her family; even, at the age of twelve, devouring Sherlock Holmes mysteries, which she later realized were among her earliest literary models for plot and character.\n\nAnd in an exhilarating conclusion, Smiley considers individually the one hundred books she read, from Don Quixote to Lolita to Atonement, presenting her own insights and often controversial opinions. In its scope and gleeful eclecticism, her reading list is one of the most compellingÃ¢â‚¬â€œand surprisingÃ¢â‚¬â€œever assembled.\n\nEngaging, wise, sometimes irreverent, Thirteen Ways is essential reading for anyone who has ever escaped into the pages of a novel or, for that matter, wanted to write one. In SmileyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own words, ones she found herself turning to over the course of her journey: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Read this. I bet youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll like it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca70ec058fa8d6f64e2cca05df85dd56bc3fa6ae","amp;dn":"13+Ways+of+Looking+at+The+Novel+-+Jane+Smiley.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca70ec058fa8d6f64e2cca05df85dd56bc3fa6ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,112,236,5,143,168,214,246,78,44,202,5,223,133,221,86,188,63,166,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
