Originally a duo, the band is known largely for its four top 40 singles.\nThe first, a cover of the Burt Bacharach/Hal David standard &quot;(There's) Always Something There to Remind Me&quot; (Bacharach himself has cited the cover as a personal favourite). The band had subsequent hits with their own compositions, &quot;Promises, Promises&quot; (not to be confused with that Bacharach/David title), &quot;When the Lights Go Out,&quot; and &quot;(What) In the Name of Love.&quot;\n\nBurning Bridges was Naked Eyes' 1983 debut album. The album was released in the United States and Canada as Naked Eyes with two tracks demoted to B-sides. The track &quot;Always Something There to Remind Me&quot; was released as a single and reached No. 59 in the United Kingdom chart and US Top 10 in July 1983. The album was released for the first time on CD in 2012 by Cherry Red Records.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adce51dfd8975ab824ec41072a4db91ae8a2eaff","amp;dn":"Naked+Eyes+-+Burning+Bridges+%28320kbps%29+%282012+Version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adce51dfd8975ab824ec41072a4db91ae8a2eaff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,206,81,223,216,151,90,184,36,236,65,7,42,77,185,26,232,162,234,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
