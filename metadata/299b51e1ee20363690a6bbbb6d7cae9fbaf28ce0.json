Certainly his renditions of the &quot;Theme from Joy House,&quot; &quot;The Cat&quot; and the &quot;Main Title from The Carpetbaggers&quot; are not all that significant. However, this CD has some tasteful arrangements for the big band by Lalo Schifrin and some good playing by the great organist on a variety of other blues-oriented material. Also the combination of organ with a big band is sometimes quite appealing, making this CD worth picking up despite its commercial tracks. ~ \n.\n\n\nRecorded at Van Gelder Recording Studio, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey on April 27 &amp; 29, 1964.\nTracklist\n1.
