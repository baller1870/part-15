Or should we restrict and progressively outlaw fossil fuels as &quot;dirty energy&quot;? I believe that if we look at the big picture, the facts are clear. If we want a healthy, livable environment, then we must be free to use fossil fuels. Why? Because for the foreseeable future, fossil fuels provide the key to a great environment: abundant, affordable, reliable energy.&quot;\n\n\nAbout the Author:\nAlex Epstein is the director of the Center for Industrial Progress, a for-profit think tank he founded in 2011.
