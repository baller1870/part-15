Relive the Mega Man experience with classically inspired bosses, each with their own unique weapons and weaknesses.\n\nThe story of Mega Man begins in the year 200X, as the advanced science of the era has created industrial robots that co-exist with humans. However, an evil genius, Dr. Wily, plots for world domination and creates his own robot army to take over mankind. Luckily for humanity, Dr. Light outfits one of his domestic robots &quot;Rock&quot; to fight Dr. Wily's creations. Mega Man is born.\n\nSet after the events of Mega Man 8, multiple riots have sprung up all over the world. Whilst many people suspect that this is another plot from Dr. Wily, Dr. Light is stunned to recognize that some of the robots rioting on the TV screen are his own creations. Even more stunning, Dr. Wily appears on television to proclaim that Dr. Light is the evil mastermind behind these latest catastrophic incidents and it's up to Mega Man to clear his creator's name!\n\n\n\n..:: Features ::..\n\nJust for JTAG/RGH.\nIt can be played as a demo.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92b931ddc2436ca59d97ea11831dc72c88823a58","amp;dn":"JTAG+-+RGH+-+XBLA+-+Mega+Man+9+%2B+Full+DLC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92b931ddc2436ca59d97ea11831dc72c88823a58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,185,49,221,194,67,108,165,157,151,234,17,131,29,199,44,136,130,58,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
