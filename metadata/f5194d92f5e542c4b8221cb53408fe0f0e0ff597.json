The album was announced on 26 January and is seen as being used in the same sense as Who Made Who was for Stephen King's Maximum Overdrive, not a greatest hits collection but a compilation album which contains both hits and lesser known tracks. \n\nUnlike Who Made Who, however, there are no new songs. Co-Chairman of Columbia Records, Steve Barnett said &quot;Jon Favreau's vision and passion for AC/DC's music blend seamlessly into this incredible film; the music really underscores the high energy and excitement of the film.&quot; \n\nThe album features an almost half-and-half mix of songs from both the Bon Scott and Brian Johnson eras of AC/DC. The album features fifteen tracks from ten different albums, ranging from 1975 to 2008, and was mixed by Mike Fraser. Only two songs (&quot;Shoot to Thrill&quot; and &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;) were used completely in the film, while one song (&quot;Back in Black&quot;) was actually featured in the previous film. &quot;Thunderstruck&quot;, &quot;War Machine&quot;, and &quot;The Razors Edge&quot; were used in trailers and commercials for the film. The album has sold over 3 million copies.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t\t\n1.  &quot;Shoot to Thrill&quot; Back in Black (1980) \t               5:17\n2.  &quot;Rock 'n' Roll Damnation&quot; Powerage (1978) \t               3:37\n3.  &quot;Guns for Hire&quot;\tFlick of the Switch (1983) \t       3:26\n4.  &quot;Cold Hearted Man&quot; Powerage (1978) \t                       3:34\n5.  &quot;Back in Black&quot; Back in Black (1980) \t               4:16\n6.  &quot;Thunderstruck&quot; The Razors Edge (1990) \t               4:53\n7.  &quot;If You Want Blood (You've Got It)&quot; Highway to Hell (1979) 4:37\n8.  &quot;Evil Walks&quot; For Those About to Rock We Salute You (1981)  4:23\n9.  &quot;T.N.T.&quot; T.N.T.
