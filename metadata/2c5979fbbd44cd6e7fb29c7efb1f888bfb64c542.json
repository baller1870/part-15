It presents the author's opinion that Marilyn Monroe was sexually involved with Robert Kennedy and that he was involved in her death. It includes a copy of Marilyn's autopsy report, several bills which were sent to her estate and details on the backgrounds of some key players, including Murray and Newcomb. Most of this material has been published elsewhere since, but he includes some which subsequent writers ignore.\n\nCapell is often dismissed as a Kennedy-hater and rabid anti-communist and it must be said that both these views come through strongly in this pamphlet. Most Monroe biographers however, although tending to be a bit sniffy about his accusations and his personal investigation, have used him as part of their research and use his findings as the basis of their own. In reality, much of what he writes has been supported by the findings of later researchers, though few of them would admit to his contribution.\n\nPricey, but not many of these around, so likely only to appeal to avid collectors or serious researchers. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Strange-Death-Marilyn-Monroe/dp/B001NGY84E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369940042&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+strange+death+of+marilyn+monroe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Strange-Death-Marilyn-Monroe/dp/B001NGY84E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369940042&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+strange+death+of+marilyn+monroe&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c5979fbbd44cd6e7fb29c7efb1f888bfb64c542","amp;dn":"The+Strange+Death+of+Marilyn+Monroe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c5979fbbd44cd6e7fb29c7efb1f888bfb64c542","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,89,121,251,189,68,205,110,127,178,156,126,251,31,136,139,251,100,197,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
