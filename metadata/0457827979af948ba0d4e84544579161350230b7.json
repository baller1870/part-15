Zubov and V. Shalnov. \n\n\n    For the most part, this is a collection of modified problems\n    discussed in extracurricular circles and at tutorials and\n    olympiads at the Moscow University.\n    In selecting and preparing the problems for this collection\n    the authors attempted to focus the attention of the reader\n    on those postulates and laws of physics where students make\n    the most mistakes. Some problems were specially selected\n    to explain comprehensively the application of the most\n    important laws -something which students often fail to\n    grasp properly. A number of problems concern the subjects\n    usually omitted in secondary school text-book problems.\n    Some problems are intended for discussion in extracurricular\n    circles or for independent study by those wishing to\n    acquaint themselves with material beyond the scope of the\n    school syllabus.\n    The most difficult problems and the problems outside\n    the scope of the secondary school syllabus are provided\n    with detailed explanations in order to give the student\n    a better understanding of the general principles of solution.\n    With this end in view, some sections are also supplemented\n    with brief information about the most frequent mistakes\n    and the simplest means of solution.\n\nThe book was translated from the Russian by A. N. Troitsky and the translation was edited by J. B. Williams. Mir Publishers published this book first time in 1974 with a second reprint in 1985. The link below is for the second print.\n\nThis will be a good material for those who are preparing for Olympiads and other competitive exams.\n\nPDF | OCR | Pagination | Bookmarked | 301 pp | 600 dpi | 19.3 MB\n\nReleased on TPB by mirtitles.org\n\n++++++\n\nContents\n\nPreface\nChapter I.
