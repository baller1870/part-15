So here is a CD in case you didn't want to look. There is also a DVD Release. But first things first.\n\nIn the Line of Fire\nDragonForce\n\nType:\n    Music\nRelease date:\n    July 10th, 2015\nCatalog ID:\n    N/A\n\nLabel:\n    Metal Blade Records\nFormat:\n    CD\n   \n\n    Songs      \n\n1. \tFury of the Storm \t08:00 \t  \n2. \tThree Hammers \t        06:38 \t  \n3. \tBlack Winter Night \t06:41 \t  \n4. \tTomorrow's Kings \t05:36 \t  \n5. \tSeasons \t        04:42 \t  \n6. \tSymphony of the Night \t05:58 \t  \n7. \tCry Thunder \t        05:16 \t  \n8. \tRing of Fire \t        03:39 \t  \n9. \tThrough the Fire and Flames \t07:58 \t  \n10. \tValley of the Damned \t  08:54 \t  \n  \t01:03:22 \t\n\nLineup\n\nSam Totman \tGuitars, Vocals (backing)\nHerman Li \tGuitars, Vocals (backing)\nVadim Pruzhanov \tKeyboards, Vocals (backing)\nFrÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©ric Leclercq \tBass, Vocals (harsh), Bass\nMarc Hudson \tVocals (lead)\nGee Anzalone \tDrums \n\n\nNow, if you like the music go to the shows and buy the merch,Want the CD buy it from the bands webpage (NOT wal-mart) that money goes to the artists not to anyone else","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:519d84478b3c7df88b3efda32d2645ccb3851bc6","amp;dn":"Dragon+Force+-+In+The+Line+Of+Fire+%28Live%29+2015++a4k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"519d84478b3c7df88b3efda32d2645ccb3851bc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,157,132,71,139,60,125,248,139,62,253,163,45,38,69,204,179,133,27,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
