One boyfriend after the next has been a total disaster, leaving Natalie distrustful toward the male population in general. So when Colin Hampton crosses her path, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cautious. Her heart (and some other body parts!) nudges her to go for it, while her head wants her to run for the hills. Colin is one of those gorgeous guys who attract women, no matter the age or marital status. With a successful career at a popular Seattle radio station, hard body, and charming personality, he is the complete package. But something dark lurks in the corners of his soul; some murky experience that has changed himÃ¢â‚¬â€maybe for the better, but maybe for the worse.\n\nWill he steal her heart and stomp over it like other guys did?\nWill she let him into her heavily fortified world despite herself?\nOr will they settle somewhere in the middleÃ¢â‚¬â€establishing the emotional boundaries to protect them from falling in love?\nGenre: Romance\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48305024c7ed7a47c823d2331c951ed3fe72774d","amp;dn":"Almost+Matched+%28Almost+Bad+Boys%29+-+Peart%2C+A.O_.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48305024c7ed7a47c823d2331c951ed3fe72774d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,48,80,36,199,237,122,71,200,35,210,51,28,149,30,211,254,114,119,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
