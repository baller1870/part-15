From the Mississippian mounds in the United States to the early pyramids of Peru, these monuments have been well-documented, but less attention has been paid to analyzing the logistical complexity involved in their creation.\r\n \r\nIn this collection, prominent archaeologists explore the sophisticated political and logistical organizations that were required to plan and complete these architectural marvels. They discuss the long-term political, social, and military impacts these projects had on their respective civilizations, and illuminate the significance of monumentality among early complex societies in the Americas. \r\n \r\nEarly New World Monumentality is ultimately a study of labor and its mobilization, as well as the long-term spiritual awe and political organization that motivated and were enhanced by such undertakings. Mounds and other impressive monuments left behind by earlier civilizations continue to reveal their secrets, offering profound insights into the development of complex societies throughout the New World","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b727e6463d8ee690a02bdcc4ee1af86781782b5c","amp;dn":"Early+New+World+Monumentality+%282012%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b727e6463d8ee690a02bdcc4ee1af86781782b5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,39,230,70,61,142,230,144,160,43,220,196,238,26,248,103,129,120,43,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
