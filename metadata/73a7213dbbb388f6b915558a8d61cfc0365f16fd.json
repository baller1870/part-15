The Darker Nations traces the intellectual origins and the political history of the twentieth century attempt to knit together the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impoverished countries in opposition to the United States and Soviet spheres of influence in the decades following World War II.\n\nSpanning every continent of the global South, Vijay PrashadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fascinating narrative takes us from the birth of postcolonial nations after World War II to the downfall and corruption of nationalist regimes. A breakthrough book of cutting-edge scholarship, it includes vivid portraits of Third World giants like IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Nehru, EgyptÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Nasser, and IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s SukarnoÃ¢â‚¬â€as well as scores of extraordinary but now-forgotten intellectuals, artists, and freedom fighters. The Darker Nations restores to memory the vibrant though flawed idea of the Third World, whose demise, Prashad ultimately argues, has produced a much impoverished international political arena.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73a7213dbbb388f6b915558a8d61cfc0365f16fd","amp;dn":"The+Darker+Nations_A+People%27s+History+of+the+Third+World+-Prasha","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73a7213dbbb388f6b915558a8d61cfc0365f16fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,167,33,61,187,179,136,246,185,21,85,138,141,97,207,192,54,95,22,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
