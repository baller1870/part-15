Now recovering from his injuries but tortured by nightmares he tries to stay on the periphery and persuade Rosie (Ruth Negga) to come home from London. When John Boy pays off a large debt, Darren yet again finds himself trapped and back under John Boy's control.\n\nStill spooked by the death of his brother Hughie, John Boy's drug habit is making him increasingly paranoid and erratic. Nidge, now John Boy's second in command and principle enforcer, is trying to juggle an always tricky personal and professional life. Trish is about to have a baby and Nidge must try to maintain peace as John Boy becomes progressively volatile. When a consignment of drugs is impounded by customs, it sparks a war with a rival gang leader Fran. As the crisis escalates, John Boy becomes unpredictable and dangerous; loyal to no-one including members of his own gang.\n\n\nIN THIS EPISODE\nNow the truth is out, Nidge is hiding out in a dingy hotel but he knows it's only a matter of time before Dano and his gang Ã¢â‚¬â€œ tooled up with an armoury of smuggled AK47s Ã¢â‚¬â€œ catch up with him. But maybe there is a deal to be done, and as Nidge sets out to enter the lionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s den, a series of betrayals is set in motion leading to redemption, vengeance, and murder.\n\nWritten by Stuart Carolan.\n\n\nCAST\nRobert Sheehan     ...
