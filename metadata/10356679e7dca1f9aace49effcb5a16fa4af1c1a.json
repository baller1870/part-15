Here Comes the Indian is, curiously, the first release to actually feature all four members of the collective -- Avey Tare, Panda Bear, the Geologist, and previously unheard contributor Deakon -- and comes across as a true mission statement for these rebels. The timing is certainly appropriate, as the band have released two divine new albums this year (the other being Campfire Songs, minus Deakon), been picked up by the ultra-cool FatCat Records, and had FatCat reissue the hard-to-find first two albums in the CollectiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s repertoire. \n\nAll this, coupled with the sudden universal usage of the Animal Collective moniker to describe all the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s projects, regardless of membership, points at the very least to a tremendous increase of focus on the part of the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s marketing instincts. But itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a focus that also bleeds deeply into the music on Here Comes the Indian, which is undeniably their best and most fully developed outing to date. The music here is, in some senses, a condensation and extension of what has come before, incorporating both the poppy psych rock of Spirit TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re Gone, Spirit TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve Vanished and the more outrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© electronic mangling of Danse Manatee. However, Indian is in many other ways an album hardly even conceivable just from listening to what came before. \n\n-Stylus Magazine.org\n\n\nI added that text to fill this up =p\nBut anyway this is a great cd get it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-Save a baby kitten and seed why dont ya?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10356679e7dca1f9aace49effcb5a16fa4af1c1a","amp;dn":"Animal+Collective+-+Here+Comes+The+Indian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10356679e7dca1f9aace49effcb5a16fa4af1c1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,53,102,121,231,220,161,249,170,206,73,239,252,181,161,111,164,175,28,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
