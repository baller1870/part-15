If I'm feeling down, if I want to party, if\nthere's some memories I want to revive. It just brings me to life\n\nOrjan Nilsen spent the last couple of months collecting the right tunes\nfor the ninth Volume of the successful Trance World series. Not only to\nbring you a balanced 2 Disk mix that represents his diverse sound, but\nmostly to bring you the true trance spirit. Throughout the past 3 years\nand divided over 8 Volumes, Signum, M.I.K.E., Robert Nickson, John\nO'Callaghan, Sean Tyas, Agnelli &amp; Nelson and Tatana have brought you\ntheir trance fix, sharing their vision of what trance should sound like\n\nOn Trance World Volume 9, it's Norwegian producer Orjan Nilsen that\nshares his vision. Known for his broad taste in trance music, ranging\nfrom his proggy trance hit 'La Guitarra' to the dark and techy 'Moving\nMojave', makes it no surprise that Trance World 9 is more diverse than\never before\n\nOrjan: &quot;After pressing play you can expect loads of different things\nFirst of all, I think you can expect a compilation that suits different\npurposes. When you're driving, when you're partying or just want to blast\nyour new speakers and seriously mess up the relationship with the\nneighbors. I think I managed to capture my sound quite well, blending the\nstyles I like into one compilation. The first cd will be a bit more\nchilled, building everything up and setting the mood with some funk,\nbefore the second takes over and just makes you want to get to a club\n\nTrance World Volume 9 features a special selection of tracks by Way Out\nWest, Arnej, W&amp;W, Roger Shah and many more in a tight mix, which doesn't\nonly take you past the latest trance and progressive hits, but also sends\nyou on an unforgettable trip down the wonderful sound of today's trance\nmusic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bca26ca24cf82bd3aadce56b1c4205fd98f90362","amp;dn":"Trance+World+Vol+9+%28Mixed+by+Orjan+Nilsen%29+2CD-2010-TGX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bca26ca24cf82bd3aadce56b1c4205fd98f90362","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,162,108,162,76,248,43,211,170,220,229,107,28,66,5,253,152,249,3,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
