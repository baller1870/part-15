Still, this is a white man&amp;#039;s blues. The overall sound makes me think of those 60s British and American pop groups playing the blues, say The Yardbirds and The Animals in their early days. The pace is usually uptempo and the band lays down a very tight and not too subtle rhythm with too much stres on bass and drums. The guitar playing is rather uninspired, but the harmonica is fine. There must be hundreds of white blues bands sounding like The Red Devils. The sound is rather muted, but acceptable. An equalizer or sound field processor will upgrade the sound quality to a certain extent, but will not do away with the hiss and rumble in the background.  &quot;One Way Out&quot; was also recorded and claimed by Elmore James, as can be checked on his &quot;One Way Out&quot; LP.\n \nCredits\nLester Butler\t- vocals, harp\nMick Jagger\t- vocals\nDave Lee Bartel\t- guitar\nPaul Size\t- guitar\nJohnny Ray Bartel- bass\nBill Bateman\t- drums\n\n\nThere are several versions:\nBlues With A Feeling (CD, Hollywood 5/92, Sound Recorders Studio with the Red Devils, VGP 070) or Wizardo Records\nMick Jagger and The Red Devils (CD, another version of the Mick blues, Rabbit Records RR 004)\nNature of My Game (CD, Hollywood 5/92, Sound Recorders Studio w/the Red Devils, MECCA CD-PRO 666)\nTHE FAMOUS BLUES SESSION (CD, Hollywood 5/92, Sound Recorders Studio w/the Red Devils, RABBIT RECORDS RR 004)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80d5bd5bcee9b337e5f64e2c5785e0af7600b691","amp;dn":"Mick+Jagger+%26+The+Red+Devils+-+The+Famous+Blues+Session+%5BUK+1995","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80d5bd5bcee9b337e5f64e2c5785e0af7600b691","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,213,189,91,206,233,179,55,229,246,78,44,87,133,224,175,118,0,182,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
