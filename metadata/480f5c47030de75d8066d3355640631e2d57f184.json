The SIngle Helix and opera chanteuse Erica Rose Sauder.\n\nThis bedroom album was written over the course of three years and finally recorded by Armando PÃƒÂ©rez (a.k.a. The Single Helix) in the Summer of 2013 through the winter of 2014. A multi-instrumentalist, PÃƒÂ©rez was patient to record these songs until he could collaborate with the right vocalist for the sound and subject matter of the album. After hearing Erica Rose Sauder sing during a talent showcase at their University in Chicago, the two met and made plans to collaborate. These twelve songs were the result of the following months.\n\nConceptualized as &quot;pillowtalk,&quot; this is what people might say to each other in their most intimate moments together.\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01.
