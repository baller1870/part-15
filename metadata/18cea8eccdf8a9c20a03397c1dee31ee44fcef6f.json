There, a bookish new recruit, Victor PeÃƒÂ±a, is assigned to assist in her interrogation. Before they learn so much as her name -- Lorca -- the squad relentlessly break her, body and soul. It is a terrifying journey into human cruelty and courage, one which years later -- in the pinnacle of cosmopolitan America -- still haunts the tormentor as dramatically as it does his victim.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18cea8eccdf8a9c20a03397c1dee31ee44fcef6f","amp;dn":"Giles+Blunt+-+Breaking+Lorca+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18cea8eccdf8a9c20a03397c1dee31ee44fcef6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,206,168,236,205,248,169,194,10,3,57,124,29,238,49,238,68,252,239,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
