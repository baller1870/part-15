This book critically reviews the current       \n   status of drug discovery research and development in Africa, for          \n   diseases that are a major threat to the health of people living in        \n   Africa. Compiled by leading African and international experts, this       \n   book presents the science and strategies of modern drug discovery. It     \n   explores how the use of natural products and traditional medicines can    \n   benefit from conventional drug discovery approaches, and proposes         \n   solutions to current technological, infrastructural, human resources,     \n   and economic challenges, which are presented when attempting to engage    \n   in full-scale drug discovery. Topics addressed are varied; from African   \n   medicinal plants to marine bioprospecting, pharmacogenetics and the use   \n   of nanotechnology. This book brings together for the first time a         \n   collection of strategies and techniques that need to be considered when   \n   developing drugs in an African setting. It is an unprecedented and        \n   truly international effort, highlighting the remarkable effort made so    \n   far in the area of drug discovery research by African scientists, and     \n   scientists from other parts of the world working on African health        \n   problems.                                                                 \n\n  +-[ ALEXANDRIA ]----------------------------------------------------------+\n  : The Royal Library of Alexandria, or Ancient Library of Alexandria, in   :\n  : Alexandria, Egypt, was the largest and most significant great library   :\n  : of the ancient world. It flourished under the patronage of the          :\n  : Ptolemaic dynasty and functioned as a major center of scholarship from  :\n  : its construction in the 3rd century BC until the Roman conquest of      :\n  : Egypt in 30 BC. The library was conceived and opened either during the  :\n  : reign of Ptolemy I Soter (323-283 BC) or during the reign of his son    :\n  : Ptolemy II (283-246 BC).                                               /:\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------------:_/--/:+  \n    &quot;With knowledge, comes wisdom - and wisdom should be shared.&quot;       /","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bf47b7224579fc7707c11f1965170e16311ca85","amp;dn":"Springer+-+Drug+Discovery+in+Africa+2012+eBook-AXA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bf47b7224579fc7707c11f1965170e16311ca85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,244,123,114,36,87,159,199,112,124,17,241,150,81,112,225,99,17,202,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
