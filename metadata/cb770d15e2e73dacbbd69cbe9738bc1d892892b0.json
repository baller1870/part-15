The intimacy between them can often trigger warmth and playfulness, but there are oceans of difference between Kim and Kelley DealÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s brilliant Breeders or Jez and Andy WilliamsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Doves and the saccharine pop of Bros and The Cheeky Girls. Leigh and Chandra Watson, identical 35-year-olds born and raised in Kentucky, but now living in California, aim to be in the former camp, making alt-folk and country of a rather classy order. But instead of being an engaging, lovely exercise in family values, Talking to You, Talking to Me is an icy cold listen.\n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also been four years since the Twins came to prominence as backing singers on Jenny LewisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ 2006 debut, Rabbit Fur Coat, and as any fans of that album would expect, their voices are strong enough to carry a whole record. Sadly, the songs here are slight and flimsy. Most of them sound like blink-and-youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll-miss-it backing tracks for under-performing American drama series, pleasant and wholesome as a high-street sandwich, but instantly forgettable. Given that many of them start promisingly, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a shame. Modern ManÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s driving drum beat loses its power when itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s faced with a butter-smooth melody about an ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œold-fashioned girlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ calling her eponymous lover. The Brave OneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s quickly-strummed country licks are quickly anaesthetised when the twins start to sing, without a whiff of interest or emotion, about the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œconfusion all around meÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Harpeth River even starts like an off cut from PortisheadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dummy, before its refined wah-wah guitars show how much more committed it is to dull elegance than the Bristol bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ragged, intense honesty.\n\nOld-fashioned songs without recourse to fancy modern textures work best for The Watson Twins, like the simple finger-clicking balladry of Tell Me Why ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a song full of simple lines about hearts sinking and being alone ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and Give Me a Chance, in which they sound heartfelt for once, begging a man to not ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtake me, love me and leave me for deadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. When they sound this alive, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hard to ignore them, but as this happens so rarely, pulses will flatline long before they flicker into life.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb770d15e2e73dacbbd69cbe9738bc1d892892b0","amp;dn":"The+Watson+Twins...Talking+to+You%2C+Talking+to+Me%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb770d15e2e73dacbbd69cbe9738bc1d892892b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,119,13,21,226,231,61,172,187,214,156,190,151,56,188,29,137,40,146,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
