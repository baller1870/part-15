Stargate SG-1 Series 3: Part Two\n\nStargate SG-1 3.4 - Excision\nStargate SG-1 3.5 - Duplicity\nStargate SG-1 3.6 - Time's Wheel\n\nSynopsis\nAbducted by some less than savoury characters, Daniel Jackson and Vala Mal Doran are caught up in the investigation of a strange object in space. What does it do, who created it and why does it seem so familiar?\n\nAs they discover more about the object, Daniel and Vala realise that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re taking on an enormously technologically advanced threat bent on rewriting the very foundations of the universe. Can they stop the disaster thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about to occur, or is life as they know it about to change forever?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e0e15df23ff193fddde418593223347b927306d","amp;dn":"Stargate+Audiobooks+Series+3+Part+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e0e15df23ff193fddde418593223347b927306d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,14,21,223,35,255,25,63,221,222,65,133,147,34,51,71,185,39,48,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
