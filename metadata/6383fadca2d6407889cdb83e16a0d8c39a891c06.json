The show served as a launchpad for the television and acting careers of Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, and the late Ryan Dunn. Since 2002, three Jackass theatrical films have been produced and released by MTV corporate sibling Paramount Pictures, continuing the franchise after its run on television. It sparked several spin-offs including Viva La Bam, Wildboyz, Homewrecker, Dr. Steve-O and Blastazoid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJackass 3D 2010\n\n\nJackass 3D: Music from the Motion Picture was released via a link to Punknews.org on the official Jackass Facebook page. Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs returns again to contribute toward the soundtrack (like Jackass Number Two).[39]\n\nIn August 2010, Rivers Cuomo confirmed that the song &quot;Memories&quot; performed by Weezer will be featured in the film.[40]\n\nCKY also announced that they created an exclusive track for the movie titled, &quot;Afterworld&quot;.
