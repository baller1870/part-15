Albums 2-4 I dubbed from vinyl myself, #1 I found online.\n\nBaja Marimba Band:\n1) Do You Know the Way to San Jose?\n2) Fowl Play\n3) Fresh Air\n4) Heads Up!\n5) The Baja Marimba Band Rides Again\n6) Those Were the Days\n7) Watch Out!\n\nI desperately wanted to include the self titled debut and 'For Animals Only' but I've had a hell of a time finding them and I dont feel like buying the vinyl as my collection is already out of control and now I have no reason to get the rest of the discography.  If anyone has access to either album, I'd appreciate letting me know!\n\nComment -- Seed -- ENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb0f024666752a80ffc60a74231383593b7029ba","amp;dn":"A%26M+Part+II%3A+Lani+Hall+%2F+Baja+Marimba+Band","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb0f024666752a80ffc60a74231383593b7029ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,15,2,70,102,117,42,128,255,198,10,116,35,19,131,89,59,112,41,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
