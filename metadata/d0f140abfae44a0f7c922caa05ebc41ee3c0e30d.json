During that time they recorded for two major labels, MGM and Decca Records. All the songs the duo released on those two labels, plus alternate takes and unreleased tracks, are included on the box. With all of that material, the set is simply too large for anyone but historians and completists to enjoy. Nevertheless, there's lots of wonderful music on the collection and anyone with the patience (and the funds) to invest in the box will not be disappointed. ~ Thom Owens","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0f140abfae44a0f7c922caa05ebc41ee3c0e30d","amp;dn":"The+Osborne+Brothers+1956-1968++%5BBear+Family+4+disc+set%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0f140abfae44a0f7c922caa05ebc41ee3c0e30d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,241,64,171,250,228,74,15,124,146,44,170,5,235,196,30,227,192,227,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
