This uplifting book explores the most relevant and pressing issues in the current labor market to show readers what techniques are working right now. Pounds weaves lessons about the job search with actual experiences of successful job seekers who overcame economic turbulence to land great jobs.\n\nReaders will also discover what to do after they secure employment to ensure that they stay visible in their field and advance on the job.\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abdcd386f3dd29a6cf7066db7a4fa7c51e5a4eb9","amp;dn":"I+Found+a+Job%21+Career+Advice+from+Job+Hunters+%2B+Conflict+101+A+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abdcd386f3dd29a6cf7066db7a4fa7c51e5a4eb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,220,211,134,243,221,41,166,207,112,102,219,122,79,167,197,30,90,78,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
