I'm everything you ever were afraid of.&quot; - Pennywise\n===========================================================================\nBased on the King Of Horror's 1986 Best Seller, &quot;It&quot; is a jittery, jolting excursion into personal fear. &quot;It&quot; raises goosebumps-and brings out the stars. Harry Anderson, Dennis Christopher, Annette O'Toole, Tim Reid, John Ritter, Tim Curry and Richard Thomas star in this thriller about a malevolent force in a small New England town.\n\nFor a television show that originally spanned two nights and lasted about 3 hours, Stephen KingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ IT actually tells a very simple story. Much of the show takes place in 1960 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a time when strange things are happening in the small, quiet town of Derry. More and more young children are going missing and on occasion theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re being found horribly mutilated. Only a few in the town are beginning to suspect the truth about what is going on.\n\nThe plot basically follows the exploits of 7 kids ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6 boys and 1 girl who call themselves the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“losers clubÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. Each one of them is somewhat of a nerdy outcast in their school and this is basically what has brought them together as friends. Not only that, but they are also aware of the strange events taking place in their town, as each one of them has experienced grisly hallucination at the hands of a sadistic clown known only as Pennywise (Tim Curry). While the gang kept their visions a secret from one another for some length of time, they eventually come to realize that they have all been going through the same thing. Each of them has had visions. Living nightmares that work against the individual childÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most primal of fears.\n\nDiscovering the source of the evil presence within their town, the 7 friends band together and enter its sewer system. Facing Pennywise, they work as a team to defeat him and drive him off. Believing him to be beaten they leave the sewer. Upon exiting they come together, forming a circle and taking a vow that if the evil of Pennywise should ever return that they would come together, no matter where they are in life to deal with him once and for all.\n\n30 years have passed and Mike Hanlon, (Tim Reid) the only member of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“loserÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s clubÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ still living in Derry discovers that Pennywise may have finally returned. Children are once again going missing and being killed. Remembering the vow, he calls the others into action, reminding them of their promise. The friends re-unit and prepare to fight Pennywise one final time. However, all is not starting off well. Upon returning to their hometown they each begin to have vision again. Not only that, but they also learn one of their ranks has committed suicide, too fearful to endure the horrors of Derry again. While many of the friends are admittedly unwilling to do battle against Pennywise again, they inevitably agree that they are the only people who can stop him. They believe that thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s power in their unity as friends, and that only they can ultimately defeat ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ IT.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:726d250eeb7b0aa26d01b3856f846efda15182e9","amp;dn":"Stephen+King%5C%27s+IT++%5BTV+miniseries+1990%5D++H.264+.m4v%2F.mp4+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"726d250eeb7b0aa26d01b3856f846efda15182e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,109,37,14,235,123,10,162,109,1,179,133,111,132,110,253,161,81,130,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
