These comprise lectures in standard physics and investigations on the foundations of quantum physics.On the one hand it included lectures on quantum information, quantum open systems, quantum transport and quantum solid state. On the other hand it included lectures on quantum measurement, models for elementary particles, sub-quantum structures and aspects on the philosophy and principles of quantum physics.The special program of this school offered a broad outlook on the current and near future fundamental research in theoretical physics.The lectures were delivered at the level of PhD students.\n\nPublisher: World Scientific Publishing Co Pte Ltd (3 December 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 9814616729\nISBN-13: 978-9814616720","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:511fc81d6f5589cbc0c98b478927d9b31beea997","amp;dn":"%5BTheo+M+Nieuwenhuizen+%2C+Inacio+A.+Pedrosa+%2C+Vaclav+Spicka+%2C+Clau","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"511fc81d6f5589cbc0c98b478927d9b31beea997","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,31,200,29,111,85,137,203,192,201,139,71,137,39,217,179,27,238,169,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
