Chad Stuart (born in Windemere, England, on December 10, 1941) and Jeremy Clyde (born March 22, 1941, in Buckinghamshire, England) met while attending London's Central School of Speech and Drama. The two became fast friends, and after Stuart taught Clyde to play guitar, they formed a folk duo as well as a rock &amp; roll group, the Jerks. Because he graduated a year ahead of his bandmates, Clyde relocated to Scotland and performed with the Dundee Repertory Theatre.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/chad-jeremy-p3860/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/chad-jeremy-p3860/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Page: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/the-best-of-chad--jeremy-one-way-r232774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/the-best-of-chad--jeremy-one-way-r232774&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002R7A&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002R7A&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
