It reached #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on Billboard's Hot Soul Singles chart.\n\nMcFadden and Whitehead also wrote songs such as &quot;I'll Always Love My Momma&quot;, &quot;Bad Luck&quot;, &quot;Wake Up Everybody&quot;, &quot;Where Are All My Friends&quot;, &quot;The More I Get, The More I Want&quot;, and &quot;Cold, Cold World&quot;.
