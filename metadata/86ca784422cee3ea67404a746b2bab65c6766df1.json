They are joined by some truly exceptional sidemen, including Earl Swope, Kai Winding, Zoot Sims, Al Cohn, Horace Silver, Duke Jordan, Red Mitchell, Tommy Potter, &amp; Roy Haynes. 20-bit remastered. Definitive. 2003. \n\nAny tribute to Jimmy Raney not mentioning the amazing work he did with Stan Getz during 1948-1953 would be lacking in perspective. To that end, here are the complete studio recordings made by these two giants for a multitude of labels including Sittin' in With, Roost, Savoy, Sesco, Clef, Prestige et al with musicians of the caliber of Duke Jordan, Curly Russell, Blossom Dearie, Horace Silver, Roy Haynes, Frank Isola, and many others in this lovingly remastered 41-track, 2-disc set.\n\nThis double-disc set features all of the studio performances between saxophonist Stan Getz and guitarist Jimmy Raney recorded between October of 1948 and April of 1953. The sheer number of labels the pair recorded for is staggering, from Sittin' in With to Roost, Savoy, Sesco, Clef, Prestige, and others.  And while Getz, particularly on the early sides, is still deeply entrenched in his worship of Charlie Parker, the cool elegance of Raney's own playing is already asserting itself on the early sides, so that by 1951, Getz has moved toward the center from strictly bebop.  Some of the other players on these sessions include Duke Jordan, Curly Russell, Blossom Dearie, Horace Silver, Roy Haynes, Frank Isola, and many others.  There are 41 performances in all, giving a striking portrait of the era, and of Getz's development as a soloist and bandleader in particular. Raney arrived fully developed and just got better.  The sound quality is solid here and the remastering job on these tracks is warm and full despite their many original sources. ~ Thom Jurek\n\n\nStan Getz &amp; Jimmy Raney - Complete Studio Sessions D2 Tracks:\n01  Stella By Starlight \n02  Time on My Hands \n03  'Tis Autumn \n04  The Way You Look Tonight \n05  Lover, Come Back to Me \n06  Body and Soul \n07  Stars Fell on Alabama \n08  You Turned the Tables on Me \n09  Lullaby of Birdland \n10  Autumn Leaves \n11  Fools Rush In \n12  These Foolish Things \n13  Thanks for the Memory \n14  How Deep Is the Ocean \n15  Hymn of the Orient \n16  These Foolish Things \n17  Signal \n18  Lee \n19  'Round Midnight \n20  Motion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86ca784422cee3ea67404a746b2bab65c6766df1","amp;dn":"Stan+Getz+%26+Jimmy+Raney+-+Complete+Studio+Sessions+%282003%29+D2+%2819","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86ca784422cee3ea67404a746b2bab65c6766df1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,202,120,68,34,206,227,234,103,64,74,116,107,43,171,101,198,118,109,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
