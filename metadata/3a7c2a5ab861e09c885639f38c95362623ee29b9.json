Cold, desolate, nothing but ice and snow for miles and miles. Carrie Stetko is a U.S. Marshal, and she's made The Ice her home. In its vastness, she has found a place where she can forget her troubled past and feel at peace... Until someone commits a murder in her jurisdiction and that peace is shattered. The murderer is one of five men scattered across the continent, and he has more reason to hide than just the slaying. Several ice samples were taken from the area around the body, and the depth of the drilling signifies something particular was removed. Enter Lily Sharpe, who wants to know what was so important another man's life had to be taken for it. But are either of the women prepared for the secrets and betrayals at the core of the situation?\n\nThe sequel to Whiteout finds US Deputy Marshal Carrie Stetko on vacation in New Zealand, but still stuck in professional exile in McMurdo Station in the South Pole. When a Russian base blows up suspiciously, her bosses promise to bring her back to civilization if she'll cut her vacation short to go poke around the debris. Although Article I of the Antarctic Treaty prohibits any military use of the continent, the Russians are suspected of using their base as a weapons cache and her bosses want her to see if she can find anything out.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abjrDUGN.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abjrDUGN.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acbIJrdT.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acbIJrdT.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adyrNdY9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adyrNdY9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acjVzGmv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acjVzGmv.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acyPViCp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acyPViCp.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acvw08gI.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acvw08gI.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adtJLgzZ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adtJLgzZ.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/actPsfMr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/actPsfMr.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a7c2a5ab861e09c885639f38c95362623ee29b9","amp;dn":"Whiteout+1-2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a7c2a5ab861e09c885639f38c95362623ee29b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,124,42,90,184,97,224,156,136,86,57,243,140,149,54,38,35,238,41,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
