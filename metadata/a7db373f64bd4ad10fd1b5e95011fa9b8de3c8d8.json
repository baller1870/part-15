The first set contains outstanding versions of favorites such as &quot;Mississippi Half-Step,&quot; &quot;Jack Straw,&quot; &quot;Cassidy&quot; and &quot;Lazy Lightning&quot; &gt; &quot;Supplication.&quot; And the second set is primo-grade '77 from start to finish. The buoyant &quot;Scarlet Begonias&quot; &gt; &quot;Fire on the Mountain&quot; that kicks things off sets the tone, but then the rest of the set is a deftly played medley starting with &quot;Estimated&quot; and moving into &quot;He's Gone,&quot; a primal drum workout from Mickey and Bill, a heart-pounding version of &quot;The Other One&quot; that's split by &quot;Wharf Rat&quot; (the only time those songs were played in that sequence), a joyful &quot;Wheel,&quot; and then a double-dose of Chuck Berry to bring it all back to rock 'n' roll basics. Talk about a thrill ride! The three-disc Dave's Picks, Volume One was mastered to HDCD specs by Jeffrey Norman, includes a colorful booklet with photos and a lively historical essay, and comes in a digipak made of 100% recycled and PCW materials.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7db373f64bd4ad10fd1b5e95011fa9b8de3c8d8","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+Dave%27s+Picks+Vol.1+%5B3CD%5D+%282012%29+MP3%40320kbps+Beol","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7db373f64bd4ad10fd1b5e95011fa9b8de3c8d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,219,55,63,100,189,74,209,15,209,181,233,80,17,250,155,141,227,200,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
