Searoad is the story of a particular place that could be any place, and of a people so distinctly drawn they could be any of us.\n\n\n\n\n\nGooD SeeDinG!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98052a559c2f7ee8dac03d6e1241726b18285487","amp;dn":"Ursula+K+Le+Guin+-+Searoad+-+Chronicles+of+Klatsand+-+Unb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98052a559c2f7ee8dac03d6e1241726b18285487","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,5,42,85,156,47,126,232,218,192,61,110,18,65,114,107,24,40,84,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
