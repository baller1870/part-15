Drawing from recent advances in agent-based computational modeling, the authors show how insights from dispersed fields like the microeconomics of capital market imperfections, industrial dynamics and the theory of stochastic processes can be fruitfully combined to improve our understanding of macroeconomic dynamics.\n\nThis book should be a valuable resource for all researchers interested in analyzing macroeconomic issues without recurring to a fictitious representative agent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20f2d73bf8350e5de46d68bdc521df3d232eb6cf","amp;dn":"Emergent+Macroeconomics+-+An+Agent-Based+Approach+to+Business+Fl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20f2d73bf8350e5de46d68bdc521df3d232eb6cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,242,215,59,248,53,14,93,228,109,104,189,197,33,223,61,35,46,182,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
