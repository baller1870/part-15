This jam session set was a little unusual in that, along with the tenor of Eddie &quot;Lockjaw&quot; Davis, guitarist Joe Pass and trombonist J.J. Johnson, trumpeter Freddie Hubbard is in the cast along with Basie; pity he never recorded with the Count Basie Orchestra. This spirited session is a strong consolation prize, with plenty of fine solos taking over familiar chord changes. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01. Jaylock\n02. Exactly Like You\n03. I'll Always Be In Love With You\n04. If I Could Be With You One Hour Tonight\n05. Honi Coles\n06. Blues For Norman\n07. Count Me In\n\nPersonnel:\nCount Basie - piano\nEddie &quot;Lockjaw&quot; Davis - tenor saxophone\nJ. J. Johnson - trombone\nFreddie Hubbard - trumpet\nJoe Pass - guitar\nJohn Heard - double bass\nJake Hanna - drums\n\nEnjoy and share!
