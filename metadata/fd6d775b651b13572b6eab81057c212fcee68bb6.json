Millions\n              of people accept the theory that intelligent life\n              forms visited Earth thousands of years ago and were\n              worshiped as gods by primitive man. Are monuments like\n              Stonehenge and Easter Island the last remains of an\n              ancient alien visitation? From unexplainable super\n              structures, to knowledge of the solar system,\n              mathematics, and even the ability to make electricity,\n              this special explores evidence of super-human\n              influences on ancient man and embarks on an\n              around-the-world search for answers. It's an\n              investigation into a theory some believe cannot be\n              true, but many agree cannot be ignored.  \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n          Group Greets     \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                                   \n         RELEASE  NOTES:\n         \n              This was the pilot for the current show. Note that\n              the first 6 minutes is straight from the Ancient\n              Aliens special from a little over a year ago. After\n              that new scenes are in this ep.
