An obvious reason for its higher quality is that it was recorded in a studio, while the bootleg consisted of in-concert demos, and the songs here have been worked to completion. Fripp has found an extremely talented singer/partner in Sylvian, who adds a lot to his quirky compositions. \n\nTrey Gunn (who plays a bass-like instrument called the stick) makes each track practically groove and breathe on his own, and allows Fripp to stretch out and experiment in ways previously unheard by this guitar icon. The First Day is a very consistent album, with the musician's excitement and energy easily being felt on such tracks as &quot;God's Monkey,&quot; &quot;Brightness,&quot; and the ten-minute tour de force &quot;Firepower.&quot; Other lengthy tracks follow (the 11-minute &quot;20th Century Dreaming&quot; and the 17-minute &quot;Darshan&quot;), but it never becomes self-indulgent or boring. Certainly one of Robert Fripp's best and more inspired King Crimson side projects.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - God's Monkey\n02 - Jean The Birdman\n03 - Firepower\n04 - Brightness Falls\n05 - 20th Century Dreaming (A Shaman's Song)\n06 - Darshan (The Road To Graceland)\n07 - Bringing Down The Light\n\n*2014 Panegyric / DGM / RF | DGM0522  {2014 DGM Remaster}\n\n\nPersonnel:\nDavid Sylvian: vocals, guitars, keyboard instruments, tapes\nRobert Fripp: guitar, frippertronics\nTrey Gunn: chapman stick, vocals\nJerry Marotta: drums, percussion instruments\nMarc Anderson: percussion\nDavid Bottrill: treatments, sampled percussion, computer programming, engineer\nIngrid Chavez: vocals\n\n\n\nSome David Sylvian Albums...\n\nDavid Sylvian - Brilliant Trees (1984) [EAC-FLAC]:\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11088946/David_Sylvian_-_Brilliant_Trees_%281984%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11088946/David_Sylvian_-_Brilliant_Trees_%281984%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDavid Sylvian - Alchemy An Index Of Possibilities (1985) [EAC-FLAC]:\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11090291/David_Sylvian_-_Alchemy_An_Index_Of_Possibilities_%281985%29_%5BEAC-FL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11090291/David_Sylvian_-_Alchemy_An_Index_Of_Possibilities_%281985%29_%5BEAC-FL&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDavid Sylvian - Gone To Earth (1986) [2CD] [EAC-FLAC]:\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11095709/David_Sylvian_-_Gone_To_Earth_%281986%29_%5B2CD%5D_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11095709/David_Sylvian_-_Gone_To_Earth_%281986%29_%5B2CD%5D_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDavid Sylvian - Secrets Of The Beehive (1987) [EAC-FLAC]:\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11101488/David_Sylvian_-_Secrets_Of_The_Beehive_%281987%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11101488/David_Sylvian_-_Secrets_Of_The_Beehive_%281987%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\nDavid Sylvian &amp; Holger Czukay - Plight &amp; Premonition (1988) [EAC-FLAC]:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11102528/David_Sylvian__amp__Holger_Czukay_-_Plight__amp__Premonition_%2819&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11102528/David_Sylvian__amp__Holger_Czukay_-_Plight__amp__Premonition_%2819&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDavid Sylvian &amp; Holger Czukay - Flux + Mutability (1989) [EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11157011/David_Sylvian__amp__Holger_Czukay_-_Flux___Mutability_%281989%29_%5BEA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11157011/David_Sylvian__amp__Holger_Czukay_-_Flux___Mutability_%281989%29_%5BEA&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nEnjoy, SEED and SHARING...
