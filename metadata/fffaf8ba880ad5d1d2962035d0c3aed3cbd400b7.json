The book explores the process of cultivation, harvesting, and roasting from bean to cup; surveys the social history of cafÃƒÂ© society from the first coffeehouses in Constantinople to beatnik havens in Berkeley and Greenwich Village; and tells the dramatic tale of high-stakes international trade and speculation for a product that can make or break entire national economies. It also examines the industryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s major players, revealing how they have systematically reduced the quality of the bean and turned a much-loved product into a commodity and lifestyle accoutrement, ruining the lives of millions of farmers around the world in the process.\n\nFinally, The Coffee Book, hailed as a Best Business Book by Library Journal when it was first published, considers the exploitation of labor and damage to the environment that mass cultivation causes, and explores the growing &quot;conscious coffee&quot; market and Fair Trade movement.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fffaf8ba880ad5d1d2962035d0c3aed3cbd400b7","amp;dn":"The+Coffee+Book%3A+Anatomy+of+an+Industry+from+Crop+to+the+Last+Dr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fffaf8ba880ad5d1d2962035d0c3aed3cbd400b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,250,248,186,136,10,213,209,210,150,32,53,208,195,174,211,203,212,0,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
