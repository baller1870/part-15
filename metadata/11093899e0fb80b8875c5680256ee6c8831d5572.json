The song, characterised by gospel-tinged melodies and saccharine lead guitar part, won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal in 2002. Bono has said the song was inspired by a fictional conversation with his friend Michael Hutchence about suicide.\n\nTrack list:\n\n01 Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of [Radio Edit]\n02 Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of [Acoustic]\n03 Stay (Faraway, So Close!)
