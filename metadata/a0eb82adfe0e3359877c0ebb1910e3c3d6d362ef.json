Also Gugges Enmanna, as he sometimes called himself, is a one-man blues band. He sings and plays guitar (mostly electric guitar on this album) with slide and additionally drums and some extra percussion, at the same time. Though musically reminds him enough about Lightnin 'Hopkins, Jimmy Reed and John Lee Hooker. Minimalist-out blues. Persistent and proactive. Heavy and rufft. No guitar chords unnecessarily without a single chord can grind on, linger and go over time to build up and to emphasize the mood. Small occasional allusions to solos. Bror Gunnar Jansson doing that which may seem so simple but is so difficult to achieve. Any and twenty years, but his voice comes from a fifty, sixty year old blues singer at the Mississippi delta in the 20s to 40s.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0eb82adfe0e3359877c0ebb1910e3c3d6d362ef","amp;dn":"Bror+Gunnar+Jansson+-+Bror+Gunnar+Jansson+%5B2012%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0eb82adfe0e3359877c0ebb1910e3c3d6d362ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,235,130,173,254,14,51,89,135,124,14,187,25,16,227,195,214,211,98,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
