Studios and released monthly between June 2009 and June 2011. The series follows on from the events of 28 Days Later, initially taking place in the gap between it and the sequel, 28 Weeks Later (much like 28 Days Later: The Aftermath) and later taking place in the time frame of 28 Weeks Later; as such, it references the American NATO occupation of London.\n\n=====================================================================================\n\n28 Days Later: The Aftermath is a graphic novel continuation of the hit film 28 Days Later written by Steve Niles and distributed by Fox Atomic Comics. It was released on April 3, 2007.\nThe book bridges the gap between the original film and its sequel 28 Weeks Later. It explores four interconnecting stories and delves deeper into the development of the Rage virus, the outbreak and battle for survival that ensued once it was released, and what it finally took to restore order in the ravaged city.\n\n\nghost dog...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d4174d245faa17434b5dad86a9fb46ed8b85d48","amp;dn":"28+Days+Later","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d4174d245faa17434b5dad86a9fb46ed8b85d48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,65,116,210,69,250,161,116,52,181,218,216,106,159,180,110,216,184,93,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
