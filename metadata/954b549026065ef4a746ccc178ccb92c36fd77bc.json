It is in her blood. Adopted by Captain Matthews on the Paradise ocean liner, she flirted with Olympic Gold as a swimmer before becoming an experienced diver with several degrees in Marine Biology. With one fateful experience below the water's surface, she became the only true link between the world above and the world below. However, the link was broken, and war between the Humans and the underwater race of the Blue threatens all of humanityÃ¢â‚¬â€with only Aspen Matthews powerful enough to stop it! Michael Turner's Fathom debuted as the best-selling comic book of 1998 and is still going strong a dozen years later with three subsequent volumes and a number of popular mini-series!\n\nCovers\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/9tl0v.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/9tl0v.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:954b549026065ef4a746ccc178ccb92c36fd77bc","amp;dn":"Fathom+Vol.1+%282011%29+%28Digital+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"954b549026065ef4a746ccc178ccb92c36fd77bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,75,84,144,38,6,94,244,167,70,204,193,120,204,185,44,54,253,119,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
