Next to Muddy Waters, he was the most influential person in shaping the post-World War II sound of the Chicago blues. \nHe also was an important link between the blues and rock and roll, working with Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley in the late-1950s, and his songs were covered by some of the biggest bands of the 1960s and 1970s, including Cream, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, The Doors, The Allman Brothers Band, and the Grateful Dead.   \n\n                                                                                                                      (Wikipedia)\n\n\n\n\n01.
