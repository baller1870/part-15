It includes many new features, improvements and bug fixes.\n\nXFlow is a next generation CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamic) software system that uses a proprietary, particle-based, meshless approach with the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), which can easily handle traditionally complex problems. \n\nSolving equations without finite elements opens infinite possibilities to the study and optimization of complex physics systems which seemed impossible until now!\n\nXFlow Features:\n\n- compressible Navier-Stokes\n- heat transfer with radiation\n- transonic and supersonic flows\n- flow through porous media\n- non-Newtonian flows\n- discrete phase model\n- complex boundary conditions (porous jump and fan models)\n- integration with rigid multibody analysis (RMB)\n\nStrengths of XFlow:\n\n- no meshing required (meshless)\n- Lagrangian particle-based kinetic solver\n- complex assembly and geometry analysis\n- high tolerance to the surface quality\n- direct turbulence model (Large Eddy Simulation Ã¢â‚¬â€œ LED)\n- advanced non-equilibrium wall models\n- automatic adaptive wake refinement\n- free surfaces and multiphase flow\n- dynamic interaction between fluids and moving bodies and deformable parts\n- acoustics simulation\n- fully parallelized for multi-core CPUs\n- easy to use interface\n- post-processing with volumetric rendering and high performance raytracing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c26c9c85fc67a842d1360c9c1927c248e34cb43","amp;dn":"Next.Limit.Technologies.XFlow.2013-SSQ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c26c9c85fc67a842d1360c9c1927c248e34cb43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,38,201,200,95,198,122,132,45,19,96,201,193,146,124,36,142,52,203,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
