Founded in 1987 by Steven Hager, the High Times Cannabis Cup takes place each November in Amsterdam. The event allows judges from around the world to sample and vote for their favorite marijuana varieties. These judges-at-large decide the Cannabis Cup (overall winner in the cannabis variety competition), best new product, best booth, best glass, best hash and best Nederhash. A team of VIP judges decide which seed company has grown the best marijuana. The High Times Cannabis Cup also includes live music, comedy and an expo for marijuana-related products from cannabis-oriented businesses. Beginning with the 6th Cup, Hager began fusing counterculture spirituality into the event and using the time 4:20 as an important ceremonial moment. &quot;Most of what I learned about spirituality came from Stephen Gaskin and Ina May Gaskin and from attending National Rainbow Family Gatherings,&quot; says Hager.\n\nMarijuana use is decriminalized in most parts of The Netherlands. Much of the marijuana present at the Cup is from the different coffee shops around Amsterdam. Usually the High Times Cannabis Cup features a surprise variety of marijuana that is new to the culture and will be tested by the judges. Many tourists go to Amsterdam specifically to attend the festival.\n\nRecently, High Times created the Medical Cannabis Cup Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an event that celebrates the medical marijuana movement in America. The first High Times Medical Cannabis Cup took place in San Francisco, California June 19Ã¢â‚¬â€œ20, 2010.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_Cup&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_Cup&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck this account for updates regularly :)\n\nThanks to the peers all over the globe seeding in this collection.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e1a3158b7ff775985d7450c5ad4af44b0ec461f","amp;dn":"Cannabis+Collection+-+the+20th+Cannabis+Cup+Anniversary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e1a3158b7ff775985d7450c5ad4af44b0ec461f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,26,49,88,183,255,119,89,133,215,69,12,90,212,175,68,176,236,70,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
