The PPG Wave 2.V is the authentic reproduction of the legendary PPG Wave 2.3. The D-Pole is the famous Waldorf Filter. What do you get when this is packed into one box? Pure creativity! Now also for Intel Macs and as AudioUnits.\n\nThree of the best-selling synthesizer and effect plug-ins, updated and optimized for the latest VST and AudioUnit host applications.\n\nThe Waldorf Edition features the famous and award-winning PPG Wave 2.V, Attack and D-Pole plug-ins as VST and AudioUnit variants for your latest Windows XP (32bit) or Mac OS X computers.\n\n\nThe Macintosh versions are Universal Binaries allowing you to run them on the latest Macintosh computers with Intel processors.          \n             \n\n\n   Features: \n   --------- \n             \n             \n   PPG Wave 2.V \n             \n   PPG Wave 2.V is the reincarnation of a cult, which started back in 1982 and \n   continues its life in modern Macintosh and Windows computers. \n             \n   Attack    \n             \n   The Attack is a percussion synthesizer with a powerful virtual-analog synth \n   engine. It seamlessly integrates the sound of the 80's analog classics  and \n   the ambitious electronic club drums of the 90's into the virtual instrument \n   hosts of  the 21st  century. The  Attack generates  all its  sounds in real \n   time, giving you the freedom to alter all parameters directly. \n             \n   D-Pole    \n             \n   The D-Pole is  a musically versatile  Filter Plug-In which  offers the same \n   powerful capabilities as the hardware equivalent. Now nothing prevents  you \n   from filtering your voice with no less than 5 filter types. Morph a  simple \n   acoustic  drum loop  into a  biting groovy  dance rhythm  using the  tempo \n   -synchronizable LFO.  Overdrive the  signal up  to +52dB.  Get the  vintage \n   ring-modulated sound for  really wild experiments  and send it  through the \n   stereo delay, or reduce the sample  rate of the signal until you  only hear \n   bleeps and clicks. \n\n\n\n\n   Compatibility: \n             \n   (WIN) VST &gt; 32bit and 64bit  \n             \n   (OSX) VST,AU &gt; 32bit and 64bit \n\n\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\n\n   Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Next open the .zip file by double clicking it.
