The dynasty began in 1901 with Henry Pierrepoint, who was followed into the gruesome profession by his brother Thomas, and in time, his eldest son Albert. Between them, they carried out an amazing 900 executions. This book recounts the lives and tales of the Pierrepoint family, their reasons for taking up the profession, and the inside details of the execution cases and the deeds themselves. Insight is shed on the feuds and intense rivalry between fellow hangmen, as well as the notorious cases that kept the family firmly in the spotlight. With extracts from diaries and comments on the family's representation in the media, this book provides a fascinating look at a profession that is long gone, but certainly not forgotten.\n\nAbout the Author\nSteve Fielding is the author of several historical crime titles such as The Hangman's Record and The Murder Casebook Series. He has worked as the Historical Consultant on the Discovery Channel series The Executioners and has contributed to several magazines such as The Criminologist.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb22e7da40556341e0fad72335fa0b0f26a5bed6","amp;dn":"Pierrepoint+-+A+Family+Of+Executioners+The+Story+Of+Britain%27s+In","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb22e7da40556341e0fad72335fa0b0f26a5bed6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,34,231,218,64,85,99,65,224,250,215,35,53,250,11,15,38,165,190,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
