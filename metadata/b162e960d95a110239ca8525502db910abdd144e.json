Lewis died on the same day as the assassination of John F Kennedy and few were at his burial; his alcoholic brother was too drunk to tell people the time of the funeral. Fifty years on, his life as a writer is now being remembered alongside other national literary heroes in Westminster Abbey's Poets' Corner.\n\nIn this personal and insightful film, Wilson paints a psychological portrait of a man who experienced fame in the public arena, but whose personal life was marked by the loss of the three women he most loved.\n\nBBC &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03jrw5j&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03jrw5j&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n===================== General =====================\nFormat : Matroska\nFile size : 634 MB\nDuration (ms) : 59mn 0s\nTotal bitrate : 1 502 Kbps\n\n===================== Video =====================\nFormat : AVC\nFormat info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;084569616648443b2639&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nUse of CABAC : Yes\nRefFrames : 3 frames\nCodec Id : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nBitrate mode : Constant\nBitRate_Nominal/String : 1 404 Kbps\nWidth : 832 pixels\nHeight : 468 pixels\nAspect ratio : 16:9\nFramerate mode : Constant\nFramerate : 25.000 fps\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nFormat : AAC\nFormat info : Advanced Audio Codec\nCodec Id : A_AAC\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannelPositions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n\nEncoded by : RMAC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b162e960d95a110239ca8525502db910abdd144e","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Narnia%27s+Lost+Poet%3A+The+Secret+Lives+and+Loves+of+CS+Lewis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b162e960d95a110239ca8525502db910abdd144e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,98,233,96,217,90,17,2,57,202,133,37,80,45,185,16,171,221,20,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
