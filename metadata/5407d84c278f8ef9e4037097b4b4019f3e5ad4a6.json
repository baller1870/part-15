I follows the fictional scientist Dr. Howell, played by Glenn Conroy, as he travels from his London hotel room to his laboratory in New York City, and shows how each scenario affects his journey as well as those around him, with various experts providing commentary on that specific disaster as it unfolds.\n\n&quot;Imagine waking up to the last day on Earth...&quot;\n\n&quot;Inspired by the predictions of scientists, End Day creates apocalyptic scenarios that go beyond reality. In a single hour, explore five different fictional disasters, from a giant tsunami hitting New York to a deadly meteorite strike on Berlin.&quot;\n\nThe movie also touches upon the development of Large Hadron Collider project. Back in 2005 this issue was not yet discussed as noisily as it is today.\nIn general, the movie is really breath-taking and quite informative. Highly recommended. \n\n\nDetailed information: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20060528185847/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/tv/end_day.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20060528185847/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/tv/end_day.shtml&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5407d84c278f8ef9e4037097b4b4019f3e5ad4a6","amp;dn":"The+End+Day%3A+a+BBC+docu-drama+%28Horizon%2C+2005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5407d84c278f8ef9e4037097b4b4019f3e5ad4a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,7,216,76,39,143,142,249,228,3,112,151,180,180,1,159,62,90,212,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
