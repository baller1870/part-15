Harmon\n\n\n\n\nIt was supposed to be a working vacationÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nFor Jacky Bouchard (aka, Artemis: vampire, night-stalking dark avenger, and reluctant superhero), a trip to the Big Easy was a chance to solidify her new Bouchard identity, meet the grandmother she didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know she had, and do a favor for the New Orleans Police Department by helping them keep an eye on their local vampires.\n\nWatching a bunch of fashion-obsessed goths with fangs should have been easy, but now sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dressing in black and sleeping in a coffin even though living the whole Fiend of The Night stereotype makes her want to vomit. And for someone working undercover, she is getting attacked a lot.\n\nWhen Jacky learns that a master vampire capable of siring progeny with his blood (an urban mythÃ¢â‚¬â€vampires donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t reproduce that way) may be haunting New Orleans, she decides to go hunting. But the streets of the French Quarter are dangerous when you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know who is hunting you, and Jacky finds herself in trouble up to her neck and needing all the help she can getÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n---------------------\nBite Me: Big Easy Nights is Marion G. Harmon's third novel. Chronologically, the book falls between Wearing the Cape and Villains Inc.\n\n\nGenre: Science Fiction | Fantasy | Paranormal\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23a5c70780517898c4cf1f7cacb908f38d520102","amp;dn":"Marion+G.+Harmon+-+Bite+Me-+Big+Easy+Nights+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%7B+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23a5c70780517898c4cf1f7cacb908f38d520102","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,165,199,7,128,81,120,152,196,207,31,124,172,185,8,243,141,82,1,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
