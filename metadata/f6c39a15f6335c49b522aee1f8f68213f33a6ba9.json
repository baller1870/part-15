Lieutenant Kuroki (Tatsuya Mihashi) keeps his men firmly in hand and is supervising the building of a boat for their escape.\n\nAn American C-47/R4D transport plane is shot down by a Japanese Zero, which in turn is shot down by an American F4U Corsair, on the same island with a platoon of U.S. marines led by Captain Dennis Bourke (Clint Walker), Sergeant Bleeker (Brad Dexter) and 2nd Lieutenant Blair (Tommy Sands). Confidante to Bourke is the chief pharmacist mate (Frank Sinatra). As both sides learn of each other's existence on the island, tension mounts resulting in a battle for the Japanese boat. The vessel is destroyed and a Japanese soldier is seriously injured. Calling a truce, Koruki trades the Americans access to water in exchange for a visit from their doctor to treat the wounded soldier, whose leg has to be amputated.\n\nThe truce results in both platoons living side by side, although a line is drawn forbidding one from encroaching on the other's side of the island. At first, there is some clandestine cooperation and trading and earnest respect and friendship. When the Americans establish radio contact and their pick-up by a US naval vessel is arranged they demand that the Japanese surrender. As the Americans proceed to the beach, the American captain orders his men to shoot to kill. They are ambushed by the coerced Japanese platoon, who presumably were also unwillingly acting on orders to shoot to kill. The Americans were given no option, but to retaliate in self-defense that results in an ensuing bloody and pointless firefight during which all the Japanese (including Kuroki) and most of the Americans are shot dead. The medic, Bourke, Bleeker, Blair and Corporal Ruffino (Richard Bakalyan) are the only survivors of the skirmish. They move onto the beach and wait to be rescued by the American naval vessel, stationed just offshore. Kuroki's final narration calls what he is to do &quot;just another day.&quot; The film ends with a long shot of the island, superimposed with the words &quot;Nobody ever wins&quot;.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 288 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 2.353:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 106 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6c39a15f6335c49b522aee1f8f68213f33a6ba9","amp;dn":"None+But+the+Brave+%281965%29+Xvid+1cd+-+Clint+Walker%2C+Frank+Sinatra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6c39a15f6335c49b522aee1f8f68213f33a6ba9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,195,154,21,246,51,92,73,181,34,174,225,248,246,130,19,243,58,107,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
