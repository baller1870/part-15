The experiment gives us an incredible insight into the ecology that exists right under our noses, living off and around us.\nMajor pest control companies are reporting up to a 50% rise in call outs and the British Pest Control Association have expressed real concerns about our ability to control infestations that get out of hand. \nBut George thinks that these house pests are misunderstood. He's going to welcome them in as houseguests, marvel in their glory and see what they'd get up to if we didn't intervene. &quot;You don't need to go the Plains of Africa to witness fascinating wildlife, it's right here in your kitchen&quot;, he says. \nAfter introducing the animals to the house - from bed bugs, to spiders, mice, to cockroaches - he lets them loose for a month of to find out what they get up to. George even stays in the house and makes himself a guinea pig in the experiment - when he sleeps between bed bug-infested sheets for a night.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;f0b8999798b0bcc4dec1&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 3186 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 47mins\n * Framerate: 25 fps\n * Number of Parts: 1\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: 1.02 GB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n1)  Further Information \n * http://www.itv.co","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:614c6dbd51d1b6b72ddefcd66d80f6efb8ac50a2","amp;dn":"The.Secret.Life.Of.Your.House.720p.HDTV.x264.AAC.MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"614c6dbd51d1b6b72ddefcd66d80f6efb8ac50a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,76,109,189,81,209,182,183,45,222,252,214,109,128,246,239,184,172,80,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
