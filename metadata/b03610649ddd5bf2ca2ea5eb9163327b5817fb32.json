Simpson murder trial:\n\n1. Without a Doubt, by Prosecuting Attorney Marcia Clark.  One of the best books on the topic, Clark shares her experience on the Simpson trial, giving her frank account of what happened, and answering her critics on how she should have tried the case.  Read by the author. \n\n2. In Contempt, by Prosecuting co-counsel Christopher Darden.  Darden explains his experience on the trial, including his interactions with Johnny Cochran, Mark Fuhrman, his relationship with Marcia Clark, his decision to have O.J. try on the bloody glove, and how many in the black community viewing him as a traitor for prosecuting Simpson.  Read by the author.\n\n3. Outrage: 5 Reasons Why O.J. Simpson Got Away with Murder, by Vincent Bugliosi (prosecuting attorney for the Charles Manson Family &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; murders).  Bugliosi details where the prosecution went wrong and how they should have tried the case to obtain a conviction.  Read by Joseph Campenella.\n\n4. Madam Foreman: A Rush to Judgment, by Simpson trial jurors Amanda Cooley, Carrie Bess, Marsha Rubin-Jackson, Tom Byrnes and Mike Walker.  This audiobook is read by the Simpson jurors, explaining their experience of the trial and their verdict.\n\n5. If I Did It, by O. J. Simpson.  This is the unabridged recording of O. J. Simpson's book, describing how he would have killed Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, *IF* he had done it (but of course, he really didn't do it).  After HarperCollins announced the publication of this book in 2006, the public outcry was so great against Simpson profiting from the murder, that the publishers cancelled the project.  A Florida bankruptcy court awarded the rights of Simpson's manuscript to the Goldman Family, to partially satisfy the unpaid civil judgment.  Read by G. Valmont Thomas.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b03610649ddd5bf2ca2ea5eb9163327b5817fb32","amp;dn":"Five+Audiobooks+on+the+O.J.+Simpson+Murder+Trial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b03610649ddd5bf2ca2ea5eb9163327b5817fb32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,54,16,100,157,221,91,242,202,46,165,235,145,99,50,123,88,23,251,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
