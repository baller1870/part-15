Pitney is sometimes characterized (or dismissed) as a shallow teen idol-type prone to operatic ballads. It's true that some of his biggest hits -- &quot;Town Without Pity,&quot; &quot;Only Love Can Break a Heart,&quot; &quot;I'm Gonna Be Strong,&quot; &quot;It Hurts to Be in Love,&quot; and &quot;Twenty Four Hours From Tulsa&quot; -- are archetypes of adolescent or just-post-adolescent agony, characterized by longing and not a little self-pity.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gene-pitney-p5148/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gene-pitney-p5148/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Stephen Cook):\n\nThis Gene Pitney import includes several of the singer's best EPs from his hitmaking prime (1961-1966). Many of Pitney's chart-toppers are present, including the Bacharach and David hits &quot;Twenty Four Hours From Tulsa&quot; and &quot;True Love Never Runs Smooth&quot; and the &quot;young love against world&quot; anthem &quot;Town Without Pity.&quot; While these hits exemplify the kind of well-produced teen pop that was Pitney's stock-in-trade, the &quot;B-sides&quot; here show off his savvy with unexpected styles, like country (&quot;The Boss's Daughter&quot;) and Italian pop (&quot;Lei Mi Aspetta&quot;). Pitney also dives directly into some of his favored wall-of-sound technique on the Phil Spector-produced &quot;Every Breath I Take&quot; and shows his hipster card on one of the earliest Stones covers, &quot;That Girl Belongs to Yesterday.&quot; Along with some excellent arrangements and quality sound, this unique collection of Pitney material provides a fine introduction to the singer's catalog.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/ep-collection-r15315&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/ep-collection-r15315&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000245QJ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000245QJ&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
