The C language was first developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at AT&amp;T Bell Labs.\nRitchie called his newly developed language C simply because there was a B programming language already. (As a\nmatter of fact, the B language led to the development of C.)\nC is a high-level programming language. In fact, C is one of the most popular general-purpose programming\nlanguages.\nIn the computer world, the further a programming language is from the computer architecture, the higher the\nlanguage's level. You can imagine that the lowest-level languages are machine languages that computers understand\ndirectly. The high-level programming languages, on the other hand, are closer to our human languages.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e703afceca1444e9b13b3589b94a96d87a1f179d","amp;dn":"Learn+C+programming+in+24hrs+%28KAKTOS%C3%A2%CB%9C%C2%BB%C3%A2%CB%9C%C2%BB%C3%A2%CB%9C%C2%BB%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e703afceca1444e9b13b3589b94a96d87a1f179d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,3,175,206,202,20,68,233,177,59,53,137,185,74,150,216,122,31,23,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
