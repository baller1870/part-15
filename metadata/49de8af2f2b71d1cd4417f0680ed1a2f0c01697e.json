Beginning with Goats Head Soup in 1972 RS IMO began an overall decline which has only been briefly relieved every five years or so by some good but flawed albums/cds, or some actual great singles off otherwise mediocre cds.) I think I was wrong. \n\nSsince that time I've come to appreciate Metamorphosis as a study in how the RS changed from their old blues covers and Brian Jones-influenced bluesy stuff into the flowering of the Glimmer Twins and their move to harder rock and roll. IMO it was in Jone's final 68-69 decline when he was less influential in the band that the famous &quot;Rolling Stones sound&quot; was established in the public's mind. \n\nMetamorphosis is a quick education in early-middle period of Stones development. Tremendous changes can be heard not only in the song styles, but also the singling tone of Jagger. It's also fun listening for session sidemen like Jimmy Page and Stephen Still in their cuts. \n\nSo for the casual RS fan, this is more than likely a pass. But for the experienced and mature listener, it's great fun listening to the RS as they mature - well, as they mature musically at least.\n\nby McCalla\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Out Of Time.wma                                                  \n02 - Don't Lie To Me.wma                                              \n03 - Some Things Just Stick In Your Mind.wma                          \n04 - Each And Everyday Of The Year.wma                                \n06 - I'd Much Rather Be With The Boys.wma                             \n07 - (Walkin' Thru The) Sleepy City.wma                               \n08 - We're Wastin' Time.wma                                           \n09 - Try A Little Harder.wma                                          \n10 - I Don't Know Why.wma                                             \n11 - If You Let Me.wma                                                \n12 - Jiving Sister Fanny.wma                                          \n13 - Downtown Suzie.wma                                               \n14 - Family.wma                                                       \n15 - Memo From Turner.wma                                             \n16 - I'm Going Down.wma    \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO\t\t\n\nFOLLOW ME ON FACEBOOK PAGES: MARCELODRGZTPB\n\nATTENTION: I will read comments on all the material shared only on my Facebook page (MARCELODRGZTPB).
