Since he has no heirs, the plan is to encourage speculators to curry his favor by visiting him and bringing gifts in the expectation of being named in his will. \r\n\r\nCast and Creatives\r\n\r\nCast \t\r\nRichard Bremmer,            Volpone\r\nMark Hadfield,              Mosca\r\nConrad Westmaas,            Nano\r\nHarvey Virdi,               Androgyno\r\nEdmund Kingsley,            Castrone\r\nTim Treloar,                Voltore\r\nMaxwell Hutcheon,           Corbaccio\r\nTim Steed,                  Corvino\r\nJames Wallace,              Sir Politic Would Be \r\nAislin McGuckin,            Celia\r\nPeter BankolÃ©,              Bonario\r\nBrigid Zengeni.

Earlier, and currently available as a fileshare,  is &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot; by numerous members of this same company. \r\n\r\n  As with The Duchess, this Greenwich production is costumed for Italy in the 1930's and features the same stage design as the previous performance of Duchess. \r\n\r\n  Purchase of the Volpone DVD set contains the same kind of teaching materials package as  The Duchess which has a separate In One Mastershot recording of the play seen from the whole stage with entrances, exits and scene changes. That is a tool for teaching theatre technique and is worth the purchase of the dvd set for your library's collection.\r\n\r\nHere Volpone is presented in a small size for easy download","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b19333b94e5902352cd122f007202b8a9539f1b4","amp;dn":"Volpone+%282009%29++by+Ben+Jonson+at+the+Greenwich+Theatre","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b19333b94e5902352cd122f007202b8a9539f1b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,147,51,185,78,89,2,53,44,209,34,240,7,32,43,138,149,57,241,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
