It is a violent, often profane, energetic and very stylish movie, that plays like some sort of modern variation on the &quot;Red Ridding Hood&quot; fairy tale. The film is (intentionally) funny and disturbing, whimsical and scary, and totally original. I think the best way to describe the movie is as a very twisted black comedy. It is actually very hard to determine when the story is meant to be taken seriously, and when the film expects the audience to laugh, and that is part of the movie's great appeal. Somehow, amid all the little nasty surprises, director Bright manages to insert a little bit of social commentary. Reese Witherspoon is unforgettable as the 16-year-old Lolita who dreams of the safe heaven that only her long-lost grandma could provide. Kiefer Sutherland is excellent as the good Samaritan who may or may not be a vicious serial killer, and Brooke Shields commands one's attention with a delicious self-parody as Sutherland's Barbie-like wife. The music score is perfect for the movie and Karin Elsener's title credits are fun. If you think you've seen everything, I recommend you to drive down director Bright's Freeway - it's a hell of a ride!\n\nRated R for strong lurid violence and sexual dialogue, some sexual situations, drug content and language.\n\n\nLanguage:                English\nRuntime:                   1:41:57\n\nResolution:               608 x 336\nFramerate:               23.9\nAspect ratio:            1.85 : 1\n\nAudio codec:            mpga\nSample rate:             48000 Hz\nBitrate:                      113 kb /s\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d11787e5947baa4cf6b7f1e79c9af9c0cbbb8caf","amp;dn":"Freeway.1996.DVDRip.Xvid-TBMs+%28Kiether+Sutherland%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d11787e5947baa4cf6b7f1e79c9af9c0cbbb8caf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,23,135,229,148,123,170,76,246,183,241,231,156,154,249,192,203,187,140,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
