Ex-soldier Tom Jeffords saves the life of an Apache boy and starts to wonder if Indians are human, after all; soon, he determines to use this chance to make himself an ambassador. Against all odds, his solitary mission into Cochise's stronghold opens a dialogue. Opportunely, the president sends General Howard with orders to conclude peace. But even with Jeffords's luck, the deep grievance and hatred on both sides make tragic failure all too likely.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a029d676416b36090c2976252b7cee0c434d5c97","amp;dn":"Broken+Arrow++%28Western+1950%29++James+Stewart%2C+Jeff+Chandler+%26amp%3B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a029d676416b36090c2976252b7cee0c434d5c97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,41,214,118,65,107,54,9,12,41,118,37,43,124,238,12,67,77,92,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
