Now, writer John Russo unleashes the next chapter in the zombie epic: Night of the Living Dead: New York! This special, self-contained, double-sized tale of unrelenting terror details the attack of flesh-eating ghouls on the unsuspecting populace of America's largest city, as the island of Manhattan becomes an inescapable death-trap. Mistakenly thought to be contained in remote, rural areas, the army of the undead has crept through the night, converging of the largest concentration of fresh meat on the East Coast, and with nowhere to run and no hope for escape, all those in the path of the zombie horde face certain, gut-ripping death as undead, cannibalistic murderers stalk the streets of the city that never sleeps! This gut-wrenching story is available in a range of covers including Regular, Wraparound, and Gore covers by Mike Wolfer, a Painted cover by Matt Busch, a Rotting cover by Jeremy Rock and a special Premium edition featuring the original movie poster from the 1968 classic film!&quot;\n\nThis is the digital copy thanks to Cypher-Empire.
