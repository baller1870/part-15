It covers the basics of DSP theory before discussing the critical aspects of DSP unique to measurement science. Key Features: Approaches signal processing through a unique measurement science perspective Covers both theory and state-of-the-art applications, from the sampling theorem to the design of FIR/IIR filters Includes important topics, for example, problems that arise when sampling periodic signals and the relationship between the sampling rate and the SNR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c583ddb4dd1993119e52c0cf5d6452da1dd63ba","amp;dn":"Digital+Signal+Processing+for+Measurement+Systems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c583ddb4dd1993119e52c0cf5d6452da1dd63ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,88,61,219,77,209,153,49,25,229,44,12,245,214,69,45,161,221,99,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
