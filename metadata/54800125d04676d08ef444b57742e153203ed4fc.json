It is considered Coltrane's first solo album, as it is the first he recorded featuring musicians and songs entirely of his choosing. All of the compositions were written by Coltrane, save one. The title track is a long, rhythmically variegated blues with a brooding minor theme that gradually shifts to major during Coltrane's first chorus. &quot;Locomotion&quot; is also a blues riff tune, in thirty-two-bar form.\n\nColtrane's next major LP, Giant Steps (1959), would break new melodic and harmonic ground in jazz, whereas Blue Train adheres to the hard bop style of the era. Two of its songs, &quot;Moment's Notice&quot; and &quot;Lazy Bird&quot;, demonstrate Coltrane's first recorded use of Coltrane changes, which he would later expand upon on Giant Steps.\n\nBlue Train remains an extremely popular disc, and during a 1960 interview Coltrane described it as his favorite album of his own up to that point.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\nSide A\n\n      &quot;Blue Train&quot; (Coltrane) - 10:43\n      &quot;Moment's Notice&quot; (Coltrane) - 9:10\n\n\nSide B\n\n      &quot;Locomotion&quot; (Coltrane) - 7:14\n      &quot;I'm Old Fashioned&quot; (Kern/Mercer) - 7:58\n      &quot;Lazy Bird&quot;(Coltrane) - 7:00\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n\n      John Coltrane - tenor saxophone\n      Lee Morgan - trumpet\n      Curtis Fuller - trombone\n      Paul Chambers - bass\n      Kenny Drew - piano\n      Philly Joe Jones - drums\n      Recorded on September 15, 1957.\n      Rudy van Gelder - engineer\n      Alfred Lion - producer\n\n\nTechnical Log\n\nRCM Hannl 'limited' with &quot;Rotating Brush&quot;\nMusic Hall MMF 5.1 Turntable with Pro-Ject Speedbox\nGoldring 1042GX reference Cartridge\nBelari VP-129 Tube Phono PreAmp with Sylvania 12AX7WA\nTascam US-144 external USB 2.0 Audiointerface\nInterconnections by &quot;Goldkabel&quot;\nWavelab 5 recording software\n\nVacuum cleaning - TT - Belari - Laptop - Wavelab 5.01 (24/96) - manual click removal - analyze (no clipping, no DC Bias offset) - split into individual Tracks - FLAC encoded (Vers. 1.21)\n\nNo silence been removed, please burn gapless to match original tracklayout.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54800125d04676d08ef444b57742e153203ed4fc","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+Blue+Train+%281957%29+%5BVinyl-180g%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54800125d04676d08ef444b57742e153203ed4fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,128,1,37,208,70,118,208,142,244,68,181,119,66,225,83,32,62,212,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
