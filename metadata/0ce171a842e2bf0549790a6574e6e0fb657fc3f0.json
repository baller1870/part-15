It hoodwinked the Nazi espionage   :\n : chiefs, sent German troops hurtling in the wrong direction, and saved      :\n : thousands of lives by deploying a secret agent who was different, in one   :\n : crucial respect, from any spy before or since: he was dead. His mission: to:\n : convince the Germans that instead of attacking Sicily, the Allied armies   :\n : planned to invade Greece.                                                  :\n : The brainchild of an eccentric RAF officer and a brilliant Jewish          :\n : barrister, the great hoax involved an extraordinary cast of characters     :\n : including a famous forensic pathologist, a gold-prospector, an inventor, a :\n : beautiful secret service secretary, a submarine captain, three novelists, a:\n : transvestite English spymaster, an irascible admiral who loved fly-fishing,:\n : and a dead Welsh tramp. Using fraud, imagination and seduction, Churchill's:\n : team of spies spun a web of deceit so elaborate and so convincing that they:\n : began to believe it themselves. The deception started in a windowless      :\n : basement beneath Whitehall. It travelled from London to Scotland to Spain  :\n : to Germany. And it ended up on Hitler's desk. Ben Macintyre, bestselling   :\n : author of Agent Zigzag, weaves together private documents, photographs,    :\n : memories, letters and diaries, as well as newly released material from the :\n : intelligence files of MI5 and Naval Intelligence, to tell for the first    :\n : time the full story of Operation Mincemeat.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ce171a842e2bf0549790a6574e6e0fb657fc3f0","amp;dn":"Ben+Macintyre+-+Operation+Mincemeat+2010+Retail+EPUB+eBook-BitBo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ce171a842e2bf0549790a6574e6e0fb657fc3f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,225,113,168,66,226,191,5,73,121,10,101,116,230,224,251,101,127,195,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
