There's a distinct blues \n\nelement present on this, his fifth CD, but it is subsumed by the \n\nSouthern-style rock &amp; roll songs he has developed and refined. Playing tunes \n\nthat define his life, Zito's music needs little explanation or embellishment -- \n\nhe's as straightforward as they come, with no punches pulled. He's prone to \n\nget funky on occasion, or go into acoustic unplugged mode, but for the most \n\npart, he sticks to tried-and-true upbeat rock songs such as &quot;Love Like This&quot; \n\nand &quot;Universe,&quot; which define where he's at. The autobiographical &quot;Time To \n\nGo Home&quot; seems to show that as much as he loves this life, he's quite able to \n\nleave it behind and head for the shed. A tough yet soulful singer, Zito's \n\nguitar playing is not all that remarkable, but he gets the job done, and \n\noccasionally reflects Wes Montgomery's chords and stingers. What makes \n\nthis recording a cut above is the excellent backing bands he mixes and \n\nmatches, including keyboardist Benmont Tench, backup vocalists Theresa \n\nJames or CeCe Bullard, bassist Hutch Hutchinson, drummer Tony \n\nBraunagel, and horn players Joe Sublett and Darrell Leonard, all pulled \n\ntogether by executive producer Randy Chortkoff. While there's a \n\nconsistency within the repeated same thing, Zito's got a world of potential, \n\nand he's just scratching the surface. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/15/mike-zito/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/15/mike-zito/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9069b8fb6c99a89266136156e10fdf89f5ae6b7","amp;dn":"Mike+Zito...Today%282008%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9069b8fb6c99a89266136156e10fdf89f5ae6b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,6,155,143,182,201,154,137,38,97,54,21,110,16,253,248,159,90,230,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
