Along her journey, she learns about both the history of the world and her own past. The gameplay is focused on a combination of swimming and singing, through which Naija can interact with the world. Songs sung by Naija can move items, affect plants and animals, and change her physical appearance into other forms. These forms have different abilities, such as firing projectiles at hostile creatures or passing through barriers inaccessible to her in her natural shape.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=\n\nOST FLAC STEREO\n\nWonderful game, i've just end game yesterday.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dffd5bedafbcf098f1e06cd2dfef835cff46e27f","amp;dn":"Aquaria+-+Original+Soundtrack+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dffd5bedafbcf098f1e06cd2dfef835cff46e27f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,253,91,237,175,188,240,152,241,224,108,210,223,239,131,92,255,70,226,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
