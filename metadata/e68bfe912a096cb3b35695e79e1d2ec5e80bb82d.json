His six-volume set Talmud Eser Sefirot (The Study of the Ten Sefirot) is the principal Kabbalah text for our generation.\n\nTalmud Eser Sefirot is a complete re-editing and commentary to the seminal works of the great 16th century Kabbalist the Ari. This is a comprehensive exposition of the system of the upper worlds, Partzufim and Sefirot, in the scientific language of Kabbalah which was developed by the Ari.\n\nAs a core Kabbalistic text, it is especially unique in its utmost precision to detail to the structural organization and processes occurring in the spiritual world. It is set out as a comprehensive textbook, complete with commentaries, a section in each chapter dedicated to further reflection upon the commentaries, definitions of terms, tables of questions and answers, an introduction clarifying how to study Kabbalah in the correct manner, and also a summarized preface of the entire text.\n\nPlease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e68bfe912a096cb3b35695e79e1d2ec5e80bb82d","amp;dn":"Kabbalah+-+Talmud+Eser+Sefirot+%28The+Study+of+the+Ten+Spheres%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e68bfe912a096cb3b35695e79e1d2ec5e80bb82d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,139,254,145,42,9,108,179,179,86,149,231,158,29,46,197,232,11,184,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
