WODEHOUSE is a comic genius best known for Bertie Wooster and Jeeves, pig loving peer Lord Emsworth, and a regiment of aunts and butlers.\n\nBut although Wodehouse and his work have become indissolubly part of the English language and it's literature, the writer himself is enigmatic.\n\nHis life, notorious for one historic blunder during the Second World War, remains unexplored.\n\nBased on research throughout Britain, Europe and the United States, Wodehouse: A Life goes deep beneath the surface of Wodehouse's extraordinary career, and reveals as never before his fascinating complexity.\n\n\nROBERT McCRUM is the author of several novels and two works of non-fiction, The Story Of English and My Year Off. He is literary editor of The Observer and lives in London.\n\n\nBILL WALLIS has appeared in over 200 radio series and plays, while among his numerous productions for the RSC are The Alchemist, The Master Builder and Twelth Night. He is also a prolific film and television actor, having numerous appearances to his credit that include Keep Tha Spidistra Flying, Midsomer Murders, Bad Girls, Doctors, Poirot and as Dr. Nick MacKenzie in Dangerfield.&quot;\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13b273b8e5c66a5e462145e9f01131689b5cdaae","amp;dn":"Wodehouse+-+A+Life+++%28Robert+McCrum%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13b273b8e5c66a5e462145e9f01131689b5cdaae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,178,115,184,229,198,106,94,70,33,69,233,240,17,49,104,155,92,218,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
