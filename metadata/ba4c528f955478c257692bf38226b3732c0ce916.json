Then, before he could hear them, Mr Gorey passed away. So sad. But here are those songs, with the Kronos Quartet providing strings and barks, on our new CD The Gorey End. We think he would have enjoyed them. If he hadn't passed away. Tragically.\nMore on The Gorey End. Listen to songs and play a game.
