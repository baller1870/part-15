Hampton Coliseum Live In 1981 is the first title in this series. The Rolling Stones American Tour in 1981 was the most successful tour of that year taking a then record $50 million dollars in ticket sales. The tour was in support of the critically and commercially successful Tattoo You album. There were fifty dates on the tour which ran from Philadelphia at the end of September through to Hampton, Virginia on the 18th and 19th of December. The show on December 18th, which was also Keith Richards birthday, was the first ever music concert to be broadcast on television as a pay-per-view event. The footage has now been carefully restored and the sound has been newly mixed by Bob Clearmountain for this first official release of the show. \n\nTRACKLISTING:\n\n(CD Disc One): \n\n01) Under My Thumb \n02) When The Whip Comes Down \n03) Let's Spend The Night Together \n04) Shattered \n05) Neighbours \n06) Black Limousine \n07) Just My Imagination \n08) Twenty Flight Rock \n09) Going To A Go Go \n10) Let Me Go \n11) Time Is On My Side \n12) Beast Of Burden \n13) Waiting On A Friend \n14) Let It Bleed \n\n\n(CD Disc Two):\n\n01) You Can t Always Get What You Want \n02) Band Introductions \n03) Happy Birthday Keith \n04) Little T &amp; A \n05) Tumbling Dice \n06) She's So Cold \n07) Hang Fire \n08) Miss You \n09) Honky Tonk Women \n10) Brown Sugar \n11) Start Me Up \n12) Jumping Jack Flash \n13) (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ada13985d81ccb80a560328dc714671727b9a90","amp;dn":"Rolling+Stones+-+From+The+Vault+-+Hampton+Coliseum+-Live+In+1981","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ada13985d81ccb80a560328dc714671727b9a90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,218,19,152,93,129,204,184,10,86,3,40,220,113,70,113,114,123,154,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
