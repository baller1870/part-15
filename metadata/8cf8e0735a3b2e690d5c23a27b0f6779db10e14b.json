It involves just two characters, but the dialogs are so vivid and have a power of expression that moves you. It also has a bitter sweet humor. The actors perform beautifully. The feelings expressed are universal, but the way of expressing them bears a Brazilian style, that it creates a particular sort of mood. It is not a movie that suits everyone, but I liked it very much and I would surely like to see it again. It is also subtly psychological. It makes you feel and think a little after having been seeing it. Anyway, in the end it is all just about love, pure love.\n========================================\n\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
