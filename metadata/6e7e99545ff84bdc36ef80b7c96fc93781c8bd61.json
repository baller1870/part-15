They have released four albums, and are known for their high energy live shows and appearances in popular culture and on television.\n\nThe band consists of Keith Slettedahl (vocals/guitar), Adam Merrin (piano/keys), Todd O'Keefe (bass guitar), and Anthony Zimmitti (drums).\n\nBy 2007, the 88 has become a four-piece with the departure of Brandon Jay, and Todd O'Keefe joined the band as Carlos Torres left to spend more time with his growing family. However, the new edition of the band remained as popular as ever, and in the spring of that year the group signed a recording contract with Island Records. In 2008 the label released their album Not Only... But Also featuring the single &quot;Go Go Go&quot;. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_88&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_88&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n2003 - Kind Of Light\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 - All The Same\n02 - Afterlife\n03 - Elbow Blues\n04 - How Good It Can Be\n05 - Kind Of Light\n06 - No Use Left For Me\n07 - God Is Coming\n08 - Hate Me\n09 - I'm A Man\n10 - Melting In The Sun\n11 - Sunday Afternoon\n12 - Something Had Me Good\n13 - Hard To Be You &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kind_of_Light&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kind_of_Light&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n2005 - Over And Over\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 - Hide Another Mistake\n02 - All 'Cause Of You\n03 - Nobody Cares\n04 - Bowls\n05 - Head Cut Off\n06 - Battle Scar\n07 - Coming Home\n08 - You Belong To Me\n09 - Haunt You\n10 - Jesus Is Good\n11 - Everybody Loves Me\n12 - Not Enough &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_and_Over_%28The_88_album%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_and_Over_%28The_88_album%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n2008 - Not Only...
