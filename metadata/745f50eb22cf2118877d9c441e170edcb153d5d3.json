In modern times, interest in Mongolia has been suddenly sparked by the opening up of the country after 70 years of isolation in the Communist block. \n\n\n\nThis first comprehensive A-to-Z encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongols provides up-to-date, accurate, and readable entries on all aspects of this people's turbulent history and rich culture, from prehistory to modern times. \n\n\n\nWhile particular emphasis is placed on the Mongol Empire, entries cover the country's entire history and range from geography to culture and religion to personalities, battles, daily life, and folklore. \n\n\n\nThis volume is a great first-stop for research on Mongolia as well as a valuable reference for those wishing to expand their knowledge of a region that is, to most westerners, exotic and relatively unknown.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:745f50eb22cf2118877d9c441e170edcb153d5d3","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Mongolia+and+The+Mongol+Empire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"745f50eb22cf2118877d9c441e170edcb153d5d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,95,80,235,34,207,33,24,135,125,156,68,30,23,14,220,177,83,213,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
