Yet there is no holding back the tide of physical afflictions that come at Sir John through the year. His father takes most of the blame - from him he inherited bronchial asthma, glaucoma and a tendency for his retinas to become detached - but sex and flowers share the responsibility too. Between them they account for a couple of falls that necessitate the occasional use of a wheelchair (quite handy, actually, at airpoirts, though a bit of a trial at cocktail parties) and strategies of almost military proportions to cross a room. The falls also make the putting on of socks an impossible task, unalleviated by the strange machine invented for that purpose that suddenly arrives in the post from New Zealand. Public and private, poignant and frank, but above all wonderfuly funny, &quot;The Summer of a Dormouse&quot; is vivid testimony to the pleasures and pains of old age. \n\n\nThe author and reader\n\nSir John Clifford Mortimer, CBE, QC (21 April 1923 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 16 January 2009) was a British barrister, dramatist, screenwriter and author. Mortimer was born in Hampstead, London, the only child of Kathleen May (nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e Smith) and Clifford Mortimer, a barrister who became blind in 1936, when he banged his head on a tree branch, but still pursued his career. His father's loss of sight was not acknowledged openly by the family.\n\nMortimer was educated at the Dragon School, Oxford, and Harrow, where he joined the Communist Party forming a one member cell. Originally Mortimer intended to be an actor, his lead role in the Dragon's 1937 production of Richard II, gained glowing reviews in The Draconian, and then a writer, but his father persuaded him against it advising: &quot;My dear boy, have some consideration for your unfortunate wife ... [the law] gets you out of the house.&quot;\n\nAt seventeen, he went up to Brasenose College, Oxford where he read law, though he was actually based at Christ Church because the Brasenose buildings had been requisitioned for the war effort. In July 1942, at the end of his second year, Mortimer was asked to leave Oxford by the Dean of Christ Church, after letters to a Bradfield sixth-former, Quentin Edwards, later a QC, were discovered by the young man's housemaster.\n\nMortimer is best remembered for creating a barrister named Horace Rumpole, whose speciality is defending those accused of crime in London's Old Bailey. Mortimer created Rumpole for Rumpole of the Bailey as a 1975 contribution to the BBCs Play For Today anthology series. Although not Mortimer's first choice of actor, Leo McKern played the character with gusto proving popular, and the idea was developed into a series Rumpole of the Bailey for Thames Television and a series of books (all written by Mortimer). In SeptemberÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“October 2003, BBC Radio 4 broadcast four new 45-minute Rumpole dramatizations by Mortimer starring Timothy West in the title role. He also dramatised many of the real-life cases of the barrister Edward Marshall-Hall in a radio series starring ex-Doctor Who star Tom Baker.\n\nMortimer was credited with the adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited for Granada Television in 1981. However, Graham Lord's unofficial biography, John Mortimer: The Devil's Advocate, revealed in 2005 that none of Mortimer's submitted scripts had in fact been used and that the screenplay was actually written by the series producer and director. Mortimer adapted John Fowles' The Ebony Tower, starring Laurence Olivier for Granada in 1984.\n\nIn 1986, his description of what he saw as Britain's descent into the viciousness of Thatcherism ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Paradise Postponed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ was televised, in an adaptation from his own novel.\n\nHe also wrote the script, based on the autobiography of Franco Zeffirelli, for the 1999 film Tea with Mussolini, directed by Zeffirelli and starring Joan Plowright, Cher, Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and Lily Tomlin. From 2004, Mortimer worked as a consultant for the politico-legal US 'dramedy' television show Boston Legal.\n\nHe developed his career as a dramatist by rising early to write before attending court, and his work in total includes over fifty books, plays, and scripts.\n\nMortimer died on 16 January 2009, aged 85, after a long illness. He had suffered a stroke in October 2008.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2391601e39331d94043743c6942260de483804c2","amp;dn":"John+Mortimer+-+The+Summer+of+a+Dormouse+%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2391601e39331d94043743c6942260de483804c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,145,96,30,57,51,29,148,4,55,67,198,148,34,96,222,72,56,4,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
