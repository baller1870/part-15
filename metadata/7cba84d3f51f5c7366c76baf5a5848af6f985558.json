It wasn't the equivalent of his immortal Chess stuff, but the Shelter sides, here in their entirety, are pretty decent themselves (and no wonder, with the Aces, Freddy King, and reliable Chicago pianist Bob Riedy all involved). A few extra numbers not on the original Shelter LP make this 18-song set even more solid.\n\n\nTrack Listing:\n01 Act Like You Love Me\n02 Broken Hearted Blues\n03 Information Please\n04 Bad Luck Blues\n05 Gold Tailed Bird\n06 Lonesome Blues\n07 Brown-Skinned Woman\n08 That's All Right\n09 You're Sweet\n10 Sloppy Drunk\n11 Live at Ma Bee's\n12 House Rocker\n13 Pretty Baby\n14 You're the One\n15 Blues (Follow Me All Day Long)\n16 Slick Chick\n17 I Lost a Good Woman\n18 Dorcie Belle\n\n\nAlbum info/personnel included in download file\n\nFormat: FLAC\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cba84d3f51f5c7366c76baf5a5848af6f985558","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Rogers+-+%5B1995%5D+Complete+Shelter+Recordings+-++Chicago+Blu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cba84d3f51f5c7366c76baf5a5848af6f985558","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,186,132,211,245,31,92,115,102,199,107,175,90,88,72,175,111,152,85,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
