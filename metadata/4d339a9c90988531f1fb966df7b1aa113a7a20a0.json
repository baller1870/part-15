Crucially, the book will not only provide an overview of the central areas in a single volume, but also explain how the areas link up, what evolutionary theory has to say bout how we think, how sub-atomic particles came into being in the big bang, and atoms in stars.\n\nAbout the Author\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gribbin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gribbin&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d339a9c90988531f1fb966df7b1aa113a7a20a0","amp;dn":"Audio+Book+%3A+John+Gribbin+-+Almost+Everyones+Guide+to+Science","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d339a9c90988531f1fb966df7b1aa113a7a20a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,51,154,156,144,152,133,49,241,251,150,109,247,177,170,17,58,122,32,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
