It was taped at a concert in Munich, (West) Germany on 1 June 1974 and the music is a mix between progressive rock and orchestral late romantic/modernist styles.\n\nThe piece on the first side, &quot;Continuo on B-A-C-H&quot; is a loose attempt to build on the unfinished triple fugue that closed Johann Sebastian Bach's Art of the Fugue. The second side of the LP is a three-part composition called &quot;Window&quot;. In the liner notes of the LP album Lord makes a comparison between the rhapsodic structure here and the renga tradition of chain composition of poetry in medieval Japan. The music of the middle section was lifted from Lord's earlier crossover effort Gemini Suite (1971).\n\nRay Fenwick, Tony Ashton, David Coverdale, Glenn Hughes and Lord himself perform as soloists along with the Munich Chamber Opera Orchestra conducted by Schoener. The album was released on LP by Purple Records (distributed by EMI) in late 1974 and reissued on cd (at least in West Germany) in 1987 by Line Records.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    1 Continuo On B.A.C.H. 16:27\n    2 Window (32:22)\n    - 1st Movement - Renga\n    - 2nd Movement - Gemini\n    - 3rd Movement - Alla Marcia: Allegro\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06b2155e5705828eeb80f5d727892caa64fd3e5c","amp;dn":"Jon+Lord+-+Windows+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06b2155e5705828eeb80f5d727892caa64fd3e5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,178,21,94,87,5,130,142,235,128,245,215,39,137,44,170,100,253,62,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
