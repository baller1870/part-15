The sound on this 24-bit limited-edition CD reissue, which is available only until May 2005, is impeccable, with a perfect mix between the singer and the orchestra, so anyone who enjoys Sarah VaughanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vocals should pick up this CD. ~ Ken Dryden, AMG \n\nPersonnel: \nSarah Vaughan (Vocals) \nFreddie Hubbard (Trumpet) \nJoe Newman (Trumpet) \nClark Terry (Trumpet) \nCharlie Shavers (Trumpet) \nJ.J.
