MobiCASE highlights state-of-the-art academic and industry research work in domain topics above the OSI transport layer with an emphasis on complete end-to-end systems and their components. Its vision is largely influenced by what we see in the consumer space today: high-end mobile phones, high-bandwidth wireless networks, novel consumer and enterprise mobile applications, scalable software infrastructures, and of course an increasingly larger user base that is moving towards an almost all-mobile lifestyle.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a72aa4d38e0f01ab75d60d440125c3bd9ab33d1","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2009%5D+Mobile+Computing%2C+Applications%2C+and+Services+First+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a72aa4d38e0f01ab75d60d440125c3bd9ab33d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,114,170,77,56,224,240,26,183,93,96,212,64,18,92,59,217,171,51,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
