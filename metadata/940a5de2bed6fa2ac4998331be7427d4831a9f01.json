Khalezov, a former Soviet citizen, a former commissioned officer of the so-called Ã¢â‚¬Å“military unit 46179Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½, otherwise known as Ã¢â‚¬Å“the Special Control ServiceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of the 12th Chief Directorate of the Defense Ministry of the USSR. The Special Control Service, also known as the Soviet atomic (later Ã¢â‚¬Å“nuclearÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) intelligence was a secret military unit responsible for detecting of nuclear explosions (including underground nuclear tests) of various adversaries of the former USSR as well as responsible for controlling of observance of various international treaties related to nuclear testing and to peaceful nuclear explosions. After September the 11th Khalezov undertook some extensive 9/11 research and proved that the Twin Towers of World Trade Center as well as its building 7 were demolished by three underground thermonuclear explosions Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which earned the very name Ã¢â‚¬Å“ground zeroÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the demolition site. Moreover, he testifies that he knew about the in-built so-called Ã¢â‚¬Å“emergency nuclear demolitions schemeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of the Twin Towers as long ago as back in the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ80s Ã¢â‚¬â€œ while being a serviceman in the Soviet Special Control Service.\n\nThe so called &quot;Third Truth&quot; is not only talking about the nuclear demolition of the WTC in New York but also about the attack on the Pentagon and its resulting misdeeds and cover-up. There is no point which you will miss in this book in regards to 9/11. Two additional books by Dimitri Khalezov are included as a bonus in PDF-format:\n\n1) A Big Lyrical Digression\n2) Philosophy - An alternative version\n\nIf you never heard of this kind of truth before so please download the book anyway. You are doing more for the good than you can imagine and please watch first the following video-interview here:\n\nDimitri Khalezov - WTC Nuclear Demolition\n\nEverybody is permitted to spread these books in their original PDF-format and it is not allowed to change the content or to badmouth this work in any manner. This last point especially extends to the so called trolls and shills who are working for the conspirators and the so called Ã¢â‚¬Å“good guysÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ who are trying their best to debunk this truth in order to safe their Ã¢â‚¬Å“politically correctÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ world which in reality is a crime.\n\nThe innocent citizen who feels positively addressed by this &quot;Third Truth&quot; should be therefore not surprised if he will be attacked by people who wants to protect the system, which will be kept up by the real perpetrators of 9/11 at any cost. There is hardly any other truth which was so badly suppressed and ridiculed like the Ã¢â‚¬Å“third truthÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by Dimitri Khalezov.\n\nPlease distribute this file in its original ZIP-format to everybody as long as possible to reach many people with this important information. Thanks to all the people in advance who will campaign for this work.\n\nwww.911thology.com\n\nwww.911-truth.net\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:940a5de2bed6fa2ac4998331be7427d4831a9f01","amp;dn":"9%2F11thology+v4+-+Full+Version+-+Dimitri+Khalezov+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"940a5de2bed6fa2ac4998331be7427d4831a9f01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,10,93,226,190,214,250,42,196,153,131,49,190,116,39,212,131,26,159,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
