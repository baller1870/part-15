Kobayashi, K. A. Jorgensen (Wiley-VCH, 2002).pdf\r\n\r\nCycloaddition reactions are among the most important tools for synthesis in organic chemistry, since these reactions are vital to the modern synthesis of natural products and biologically active substances.\r\n\r\nMetal catalysis plays an increasingly important role in these reactions, often allowing several stereocenters to be selectively created and integrated in the target molecules. Kobayashi and Jorgensen's handbook provides numerous examples of metal-catalyzed reactions, including [2+1], [3+2] and [4+2] cycloadditions. Important reactions such as carbo- and hetero-Diels-Alder, carbocyclic, cyclopropanation and 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions are discussed. A large number of experimental procedures gives a concrete idea of the use of metal-catalyzed cycloaddition reactions in modern synthesis.\r\n\r\nThe book is aimed at chemists in industry or academia, who want to effectively use cycloadditions in their work","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ca5c04ac69ecc966d9f0ada220eaff0729e2d35","amp;dn":"Cycloaddition+Reactions+in+Organic+Synthesis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ca5c04ac69ecc966d9f0ada220eaff0729e2d35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,165,192,74,198,158,204,150,109,159,10,218,34,14,175,240,114,158,45,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
