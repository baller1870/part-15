Set in France between 1910 and 1940 and first published in France in 1947, five years after the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death, All Our Worldly Goods is a gripping story of war, family life and star-crossed lovers. \n\nPierre and Agnes marry for love against the wishes of his parents and his grandfather, the tyrannical family patriarch. Their marriage provokes a family feud that cascades down the generations. This brilliant novel is full of drama, heartbreak, and the telling observations that have made NÃƒÂ©mirovskyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work so beloved and admired.\n\nGenre: Historical Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17a18c2a22b9e27a8161e133dab2ce75f859ae3a","amp;dn":"All+Our+Worldly+Goods+by+Irene+Nemirovsky","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17a18c2a22b9e27a8161e133dab2ce75f859ae3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,161,140,42,34,185,226,122,129,97,225,51,218,178,206,117,248,89,174,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
