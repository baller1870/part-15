Pitney is sometimes characterized (or dismissed) as a shallow teen idol-type prone to operatic ballads. It's true that some of his biggest hits -- &quot;Town Without Pity,&quot; &quot;Only Love Can Break a Heart,&quot; &quot;I'm Gonna Be Strong,&quot; &quot;It Hurts to Be in Love,&quot; and &quot;Twenty Four Hours From Tulsa&quot; -- are archetypes of adolescent or just-post-adolescent agony, characterized by longing and not a little self-pity.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gene-pitney-p5148/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gene-pitney-p5148/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Reviews:\n\n2 for 1\nAMG Review by Bruce Eder\n\nSequel Records exhumed most of the Gene Pitney catalog on Musicor for reissue in the '90s. True, most casual fans would probably be satisfied with a collection of hits, as the singles generally constituted Pitney's strongest material, but this particular pairing -- of his two LPs from 1967 -- is notable for going against that pattern. Young and Warm and Wonderful was a stand-alone LP, not connected with any hit single, and featured one of the odder and more daring bodies of repertory in Pitney's output, mostly standards from the '40s or earlier. And Just One Smile was an album built around an unexpected hit (recorded two years before) that caught Pitney with some very strong LP tracks (one of which was to chart as a U.K. single several years later). So there's nothing routine about the contents here, and the producers have done us the kindness of including the U.S. and U.K. variant tracks on Just One Smile, and they've also appended a pair of chronologically related single sides to the paired LP tracks. The resulting CD is chock-full of material that Pitney fans will love, and which won't displease even casual listeners. Perhaps there's nothing as memorable here as &quot;24 Hours from Tulsa&quot; or &quot;Town Without Pity,&quot; but the CD gives a good explanation for his career longevity, especially in England.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/young-and-warm-and-wonderfuljust-one-smile-r278227/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/young-and-warm-and-wonderfuljust-one-smile-r278227/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\n=======\n\nYoung and Warm and Wonderful\nAMG Review by Bruce Eder\n\nThis was one of Gene Pitney's more unusual albums, in that it was neither hooked around a hit single, nor did it yield a hit among its dozen tracks. But as a result, it's also one of his more musically consistent albums -- there is no one obvious pop/rock hit to overshadow the rest of it, which is mostly comprised of Pitney's pleasant if undemanding covers of standards, ...\n\nRead all of it at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/young-and-warm-and-wonderful-r15313/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/young-and-warm-and-wonderful-r15313/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\n========\n\nJust One Smile\nAMG Review by Bruce Eder\n\nJust One Smile became something of a return to form for Gene Pitney, after the digression into pop standards on Young and Warm and Wonderful. The title track had first been released on the album I Must Be Seeing Things two years before, but following Pitney's success in England with another Randy Newman-authored composition, Musicor reached back and pulled the older track out as a single (which made the British Top Ten and the American Top 100). The album that followed was a suitably melodic and mostly uptempo creation, the highlights of which included &quot;Lonely Drifter&quot; and &quot;The Comedian.&quot; The American and British versions of the album differed in two songs each -- &quot;The Rising Tide of Love&quot; and &quot;The Boss' Daughter&quot; appeared in the U.S. album, while they were replaced by &quot;Where Did the Magic Go&quot; and &quot;24 Sycamore&quot; on the U.K. version. None is a lost classic and the tradeoff is about even, and the Sequel Records reissue includes all four cuts.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/just-one-smile-r15299&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/just-one-smile-r15299&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000000PTW&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000000PTW&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
