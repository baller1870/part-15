TaylorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s electrifying account of two complex menÃ¢â‚¬â€œas well as of a game and a country at a crossroadsÃ¢â‚¬â€œis an epic narrative of sports in America during the 1960s.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to imagine two characters better suited to leading roles in the NBA saga: Chamberlain was cast as the athletically gifted yet mercurial titan, while Russell played the role of the stalwart centerpiece of the Boston Celtics dynasty. Taylor delves beneath these stereotypes, detailing how the two opposed and complemented each other and how they revolutionized the way the game was played and perceived by fans.\n\nCompeting with and against such heroes as Jerry West, Tom Heinsohn, Bob Cousy, John Havlicek, and Elgin Baylor, and playing for the two greatest coaches of the era, Alex Hannum and the fiery Red Auerbach, Chamberlain and Russell propelled the NBA into the spotlight. But their off-court visibility and successÃ¢â‚¬â€œto say nothing of their candorÃ¢â‚¬â€œalso inflamed passions along AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s racial and generational fault lines. In many ways, Russell and Chamberlain helped make the NBA and, to some extent, America what they are today.\n\nFilled with dramatic conflicts and some of the great moments in sports history, and building to a thrilling climaxÃ¢â‚¬â€œthe 1969 final series, the last showdown between Russell and ChamberlainÃ¢â‚¬â€œThe Rivalry has at its core a philosophical question: Can determination and a team ethos, embodied by the ultimate team player, Bill Russell, trump sheer talent, embodied by Wilt Chamberlain?\n\nGripping, insightful, and utterly compelling, the story of Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain is the stuff of sporting legend. Written with a reporterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unerring command of events and a storytellerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flair, The Rivalry will take its place as one of the classic works of sports history.\n\nGenre: Non Fiction | History","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77209b6632934a6b6251472a558b917207f3ea56","amp;dn":"The+Rivalry+by+John+Taylor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77209b6632934a6b6251472a558b917207f3ea56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,32,155,102,50,147,74,107,98,81,71,42,85,139,145,114,7,243,234,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
