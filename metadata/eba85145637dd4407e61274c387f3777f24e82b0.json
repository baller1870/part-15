You can hit a punching bag to increase power and speed, spar with an opponent for more stamina and agility, attack the dummy to improve chin and body, or hit the mitts to improve heart and cut. Besides career mode, you have access to the standard modes.\n\nFight Night 2004 features the &quot;Total Control&quot; system, which utilizes both sticks to give you complete precision over your boxer's moves.
