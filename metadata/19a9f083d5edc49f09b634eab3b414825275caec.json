Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason is his major work on the subject.\n\n This book offers a complete and internally cohesive interpretation of Religion. In contrast to more reductive interpretations, as well as those that characterize Religion as internally inconsistent, Lawrence R. Pasternack defends the rich philosophical theology contained in each of ReligionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s four parts, and shows how the doctrines of the &quot;Pure Rational System of Religion&quot; are eminently compatible with the essential principles of Transcendental Idealism. The book also presents and assesses:\n\n the philosophical background to Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason\n\n the ideas and arguments of the text\n\n the continuing importance of KantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work to philosophy of religion today.
