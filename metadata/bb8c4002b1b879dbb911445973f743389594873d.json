A compelling story of dictatorship, bloody battles, and endless courage as the Soviet people combat not only Hitler and the Germany Army, but their own leader as well. Hosted by former US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, this 10-hour program features never-before-seen Russian images, once-secret documents, and leading Russian historians to explore Russia from 1924 through 1953.\n\nThe 'Russia's War' television documentary was a prestige production, with ten 52 minute episodes. Some of the episodes were introduced by Henry Kissinger. Nigel Hawthorne served as the narrator. The important Russian historians Dmitrii Volkogonov (Stalin's biographer) and Mikhail Semiriaga were cred as consultants, alongside Richard Overy; both Volkogonov and Semiriaga appeared on screen in various episodes.&quot;\n\n01 - The Darkness Descends\n02 - The Night before Midnight\n03 - The Goths Ride East\n04 - Between Life and Death\n05 - The Fight from Within\n06 - The Cauldron Boils\n07 - The Citadel\n08 - False Dawn\n09 - The Fall of the Swastika\n10 - The Cult of Personality","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb8c4002b1b879dbb911445973f743389594873d","amp;dn":"Russia%27s+War+-+Blood+upon+the+Snow+-+The+Stalin+Years+%5B1924-1953","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb8c4002b1b879dbb911445973f743389594873d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,140,64,2,177,184,121,219,185,17,68,89,115,247,67,56,149,148,135,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
