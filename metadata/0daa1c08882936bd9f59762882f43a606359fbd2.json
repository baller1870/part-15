Buckminster &quot;Bucky&quot; Fuller had a keen awareness that we're all in this together. Understanding that we humans don't have a clue about how to operate our fragile Spaceship Earth, Buckminster provided insightful design science solutions to our most challenging issues, including war, overpopulation, housing, increasing inflation, health care, the energy crisis, and much more. For all its genius, Fuller's legacy has yet to be fully discovered. The world needs to hear Buckminster's voice as it calls upon each of us to shift our intellectual and technological resources from creating weaponry to creating livingry.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0daa1c08882936bd9f59762882f43a606359fbd2","amp;dn":"Steven+Sieden+-+A+Fuller+View%3A+Buckminster+Fuller%27s+Vision+of+Ho","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0daa1c08882936bd9f59762882f43a606359fbd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,170,28,8,136,41,54,189,159,89,118,40,130,244,58,96,99,89,251,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
