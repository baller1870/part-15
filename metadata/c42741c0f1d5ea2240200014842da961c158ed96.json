The band was originally formed in 1963 by guitarist Steve Fataar, bassist Brother Fataar (real name Edries Fataar), drummer George Faber and guitarist Eugene Champion. However, this line-up would only be together to record a couple of songs. Ricky Fataar replaced George Faber as the band's drummer around 1964 and Edries Fredericks replaced Eugene Champion as the guitarist. Baby Duval briefly replaced Edries Fredericks in 1967, although it is unclear whether he was involved in any of the recordings that were released. Blondie Chaplin then replaced Baby Duval in 1967. This was to be the line-up from 1967 until their demise as a group in 1970.\n\nIn 1970, they recorded the only non-Beach Boys album on the Brother records label, produced by Carl Wilson under the name &quot;The Flame&quot; (to avoid confusion with James Brown's The Famous Flames) \n\nIn 1972 Ricky Fataar and Blondie Chaplin joined The Beach Boys.\n\n\nThe Best Of The Flames:\n\n1\tFor Your Precious Love\n2\tDon't Fight It\n3\tDon't Make Your Children Pay\n4\tStop Look And Listen\n5\tTell It Like It Is\n6\tKnock On Wood\n7\tHold Om I'm Coming\n7\tHold On I'm Coming\n8\tWhen Something Is Wrong With My Baby\n9\tLand Of A Thousand Dances\n10\tYou've Got It Made\n11\tTry A Little Tenderness\n12\tA Place In The Sun\n13\tRestless\n14\tLost\n15\tBlue Colour\n16\tPurple Haze\n\nAll tracks in MP3 format, 160kbps\n\nSCANNED WITH ESET SMART SECURITY: NO THREATS OR INFECTIONS\n\nPLEASE SEED !!
