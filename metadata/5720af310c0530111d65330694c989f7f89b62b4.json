A rich array of singers from different traditions and an innovative instrumental mix ensure plenty of variety.\nThe first two tracks are mellow mid-tempo numbers with lovely vocal arrangements. Sung partly in Spanish by Ximena Tascon, Whisky Priests has a Latin American rhythm and great guitars. North Africa is next, with the track I'm An Algerian sung by Abel Ali Slimani and then it's Latin again with Amor and then Jamaican with some ragga style vocals by Chaka Demus on Amor Dub.\nThe title track is a mix of soul and Middle Eastern, whilst the buoyant The Sun Does Rise is a beautiful anthemic pop ballad. If it weren't, this song should have been a hit. When The Storm Comes is a jazzy ballad whilst I Love Everybody is a stream of consciousness poem with a spiritual message. A highlight of the album, Yoga Of The Nightclub is an atmospheric trance number with a hypnotic beat and innovative vocal arrangements.\nThe interesting sonic mix of Angels includes Baaba Maal on vocals and Massamba Diop on talking drum for an African ambience whilst the next track Raga takes the listener to India, with vocals by Najma Akhtar. The album concludes with Forever, a tuneful pop ballad. The impressive stylistic scope and a high proportion of melodious songs make this album a pleasurable listening experience.
