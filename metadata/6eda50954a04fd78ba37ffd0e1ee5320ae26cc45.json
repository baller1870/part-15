We have one of the lowest priced fully assembled machine with custom precision software at $2500 and DIY kits at $1600. It is one of highest quality machines (80 microns and going lower) on the market and can compete with $20-50k machines.\n\nThe sharing and selling of digital models is something we have been trying to address and game plan for the future, but at this point, our 3D printers can print anything you want, it is pretty great!\n\nWe offer manufacturing freedom and we hope this stays a reality for everyoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“s sake. It appears at this point with SOPA dead, this just might be the case!\n\nIf you are interested in seeing the Buildatron 2 low cost 3D printer check it out here at http://lab.buildatron.com or at http://Buildatron.com\n\n\nBuildatron Systems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6eda50954a04fd78ba37ffd0e1ee5320ae26cc45","amp;dn":"Buildatron_Systems_3D_Printers_-_Buildatron_3D_Printer_Logo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6eda50954a04fd78ba37ffd0e1ee5320ae26cc45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,218,80,149,74,4,253,120,186,55,255,208,225,238,83,32,174,38,204,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
