Key to the Highway [00.32] Bonus Track By Ian Stewart.\n\nPlaying Time.........: 40.02\nTotal Size...........: 245,88 MB\n\nIn March 1986, The Rolling Stones' cover of &quot;Harlem Shuffle&quot; (their first lead single from a studio album not to be a Jagger/Richards original since the earliest days) was released to a receptive audience, reaching #13 in the UK and #5 in the US, though it did not receive the same amount of exposure as previous hits.[citation needed] The follow-up single &quot;One Hit (To the Body)&quot; was a top 30 hit and featured a revealing video of Jagger and Richards seeming to trade blows.\n\nDirty Work was released a week after &quot;Harlem Shuffle,&quot; reaching #4 in the UK and US (going platinum there), but the critical reaction was less than enthusiastic.[citation needed] Some reviewers felt the album was slight in places, with weak, generic songwriting from Richards and Wood and puzzlingly abrasive vocals from Jagger.[who?] Some felt Jagger was saving his best material for his solo records, though the critical reaction to those releases was muted as well.[citation needed] Dirty Work's critical standing has only marginally improved over the years, perhaps because it lacks any favourable hits.\n\nHowever, in 1986, Robert Christgau called Dirty Work &quot;a bracing and even challenging record [which] innovates without kowtowing to multi-platinum fashion or half-assed pretension. It's honest and makes you like it.&quot;In 2004, Stylus Magazine's &quot;On Second Thoughts&quot; feature assessed the album as &quot;a tattered, embarrassed triumph, by far the most interesting Stones album since Some Girls at every level: lyrical, conceptual, instrumental.&quot; The re-evaluation of the album finds that despite its change of style to a then current 80s-style production and experimentation, the album features &quot;the most venomous guitar sound of the Stones' career, and Jagger's most committed vocals.&quot;\n\nKeith said every song on this album was structured so it could be played live with a view to touring to support the album, before Mick decided he wasn't going to tour after all.(As mentioned, Mick later cited his concerns about Charlie's health for not doing so.)\n\nThe album produced a hit for the Rolling Stones, their cover of &quot;Harlem Shuffle&quot;, and featured a number of guest appearances, including contributions by Tom Waits, Patti Scialfa, Bobby Womack, and Jimmy Page on &quot;One Hit (To the Body)&quot;.\n\n\nThis album is dedicated to Ian Stewart. &quot;Thanks, Stu, for 25 years of boogie-woogie&quot;.\nAn unlisted and uncredited excerpt from &quot;Key to the Highway&quot; (Big Bill Broonzy/Charles Segar - 0:33) closes the album. It was played by Stewart, who died shortly after the recording sessions for the album had ended.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d26e468fc6670344fe8a7c52621893abb96bd446","amp;dn":"Rolling+Stones+-+Dirty+Work+%5BFlac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d26e468fc6670344fe8a7c52621893abb96bd446","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,110,70,143,198,103,3,68,254,138,124,82,98,24,147,171,185,107,212,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
