It seems the team have shipped over everything but the kitchen sink! There are 126 iPods (for the restaurant's famed, multi-sensory dish 'Sound of the Sea'), 106 sauce spoons, 300 champagne glasses, a $20,000 vacuum oven, and a specialist piece of kit interestingly called &quot;The Polar Bear&quot;.\r\n\r\nWith just three weeks until their first-ever Australian service, the team must settle into their temporary home, and welcome and train new staff. It's an unfamiliar environment, and the kitchen and restaurant are still a work-in-progress, so stresses and strains begin taking their toll. For Heston, things don't go to plan as he announces an online ticket ballot, only for scalpers to run off with hundreds of prized seats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 07-Apr-2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07f611cb2ba221eee71e94d7ae7629ff588b0a1f","amp;dn":"Inside+Hestons+World+S01E02+HDTV.x264-TVC.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07f611cb2ba221eee71e94d7ae7629ff588b0a1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,246,17,203,43,162,33,238,231,30,148,215,174,118,41,255,88,139,10,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
