Discovering that Rachel, a sports journalist, had been doing a story on the brutal killing of a foreign tourist, they are puzzled by her interest in such a grisly crime. It emerges that Rachelâ€™s investigation went far beyond a single murder, and their lives are soon under threat too.\r\nWith a traumatic event from their teenage years coming back to haunt them, the trio realises that the mystery has its roots in their own past. In the midst of battling their personal demons, they make a desperate plan to flush out a sadistic killer in the sylvan setting of their old boarding school in the Himalayan foothills. With the body count rising and long-buried secrets tumbling out, will they succeed?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:136fb2cc730659169043d539c9366ab8783fd4e8","amp;dn":"Second+Lives+by+Anish+Sarkar+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"136fb2cc730659169043d539c9366ab8783fd4e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,111,178,204,115,6,89,22,144,67,213,57,201,54,106,184,120,63,212,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
