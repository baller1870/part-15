Come, let me clutch thee.\r\nI have thee not, and yet I see thee still.\r\nArt thou not, fatal vision, sensible\r\nTo feeling as to sight? or art thou but\r\nA dagger of the mind, a false creation,\r\nProceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?\r\nI see thee yet, in form as palpable\r\nAs this which now I draw.\r\nThou marshall'st me the way that I was going;\r\nAnd such an instrument I was to use.\r\nMine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,\r\nOr else worth all the rest; I see thee still,\r\nAnd on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,\r\nWhich was not so before. There's no such thing:\r\nIt is the bloody business which informs\r\nThus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld\r\nNature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse\r\nThe curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates\r\nPale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,\r\nAlarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,\r\nWhose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.\r\nWith Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design\r\nMoves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,\r\nHear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear\r\nThy very stones prate of my whereabout,\r\nAnd take the present horror from the time,\r\nWhich now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:\r\nWords to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Naxos Macbeth from1993, with Stephen Dillane and Fiona Shaw as the principals.
