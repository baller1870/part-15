Davis is one of the most innovative, influential, and respected figures in the history of music. Heâ€™s been at the forefront of bebop, cool jazz, hard bop, modal jazz, and jazz-rock fusion, and remains the favorite and best-selling jazz artist ever, beloved worldwide.\r\nHeâ€™s also a fascinating characterâ€”moody, dangerous, brilliant. His story is phenomenal, including tempestous relationships with movie stars, heroin addictions, police busts, and more; connections with other jazz greats like Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonius Monk, John Coltrane, Gil Evans, John McLaughlin, and many others; and later fusion ventures that outraged the worlds of jazz and rock.\r\n\r\nWritten by an all-star team, including Sonny Rollins, Bill Cosby, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, Clark Terry, Lenny White, Greg Tate, Ashley Kahn, Robin D. G. Kelley, Francis Davis, George Wein, Vincent BessiÃ¨res, Gerald Early, Nate Chinen, Nalini Jones, Dave Liebman, Garth Cartwright, and more","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f2953a752f866c43492b7e27e56ca5fa793dae4","amp;dn":"Miles+Davis+-+The+Complete+Illustrated+History+%28Music+Art+Ebook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f2953a752f866c43492b7e27e56ca5fa793dae4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,41,83,167,82,248,102,196,52,146,183,226,126,86,202,95,167,147,218,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
