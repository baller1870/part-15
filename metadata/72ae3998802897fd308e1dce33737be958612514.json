Using plenty of visuals and straightforward terms, Lhotka walks you step-by-step through over a dozen projects. Forget printing on boring old paper, in Digital Alchemy, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn how to transfer and print images to a variety of surfaces including metal, wood, fabric, stone, and plastic using the techniques LhotkaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s spent years developing.\n\nIf youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re a photographer looking for new ways to personalize your work or a digital artist whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ready to take your work to the next level, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll find all of the tools, techniques, and inspiration you need in this book. LhotkaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s enthusiasm for experimenting with unusual printing materials and processes has led her to create new and amazing transfer techniques, including one that resembles a PolaroidÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ transfer on steroids. She also shows you how to make prints using unexpected, everyday materials such as hand sanitizer and gelatin. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll even learn direct printing, the technique for sending your custom substrate through your printer almost as if it were paper.\n\nIn Digital Alchemy, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn how to:\nTransfer images to metal, wood, plastic, and other materials that will not feed through an inkjet printer\nPrint directly on metal for a fraction of the cost of using a print service\nSimulate a print from an expensive UV flatbed printer using an inexpensive desktop printer\nUse carrier sheets and paintable precoats to print on almost any surface\nAchieve near-lithographic quality digital prints with transfer processes to uncoated fine art paper","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72ae3998802897fd308e1dce33737be958612514","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2010%5D+Digital+Alchemy+Printmaking+techniques+for+fine+art","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72ae3998802897fd308e1dce33737be958612514","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,174,57,152,128,40,151,253,48,142,29,206,51,115,123,233,88,97,37,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
