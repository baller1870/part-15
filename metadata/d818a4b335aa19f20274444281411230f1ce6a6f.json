The Elvis Presley Show was a HAPPENING and first Spring appearance in Sin City since 1956 was no different. The 50s gig was definitely way above in terms of performance, but nonetheless a flop at the time. Wrong place, wrong moment! But by 1969 Elvis returned and established himself as the King Of Vegas.\nMarch 1975 wasn't a flop although he had health problems, but he still was in an excellent mood and with new studio material recorded about a week before. He was away from Las Vegas since Sept 1974, but he opened this Season with some of his new songs; And I Love You So, Green Green Grass Of Home and Fairytale. T-R-O-U-B-L-E would wait up to his next tour before entering his song list as a regular number, whilst the odd Shake A Hand and Pieces Of My Life were performed a bit later during the July 1975 tour.\nThe first CD features the nearly complete pre-show (no Elvis), and on the second CD the March 22, 1975 Midnight performance along with some bonus tracks recorded three nights earlier.\nThe March 22, 1975 MS has been released twice but our source is definitely from an earlier generation. The very short Joe Orchestra introduction before the Also Sprach Zarathustra is not on the aforementioned releases and presence of vocal distortion in Elvis' vocal is rather smooth and less annoying than it was before.\nThis new digipack double set will be a very limited edition and first intended for the fans who didn't have these recordings, or all the ones wanting the complete happening.\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n\nCD1:\n\n01 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Joe GuercioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Orchestra Opening\n02 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ GoinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Back To Memphis\n03 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Into The FatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s House\n04 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Philadelphia Freedom\n05 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Stevie Wonder Medley\n06 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Comedy Act\n\n\nCD2:\n\n01 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Orchestra Intro Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Also Sprach Zarathustra\n02 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ See See Rider\n03 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I Got A Woman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Amen\n04 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Love Me\n05 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ If You Love Me (Let Me Know)\n06 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ And I Love You So\n07 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Big Boss Man\n08 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Midnight\n09 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Promised Land\n10 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Green Green Grass Of Home\n11 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Fairytale\n12 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Introductions\n13 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d I Say (Lead Guitar Solo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ James Burton)\n14 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Drum Solo (Ronnie Tutt)\n15 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bass Solo (Duke Bardwell)\n16 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Piano Solo (Glen D.
