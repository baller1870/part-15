Heartbreaker\r\n*audience patch (Phil's Knebworth source used)\r\n\r\nComments: \r\nA pretty good show but nothing compared to the standards Zeppelin \r\nhad set in the past. The first 45 minutes or so sound good and \r\nstrong, and Ten Years Gone is very pretty, but towards the middle \r\nsection, the individual performances, though good, don't quite gel \r\ninto a good ensemble performance. &quot;Well, it's nice to see you again&quot; \r\nsaid Plant to the audience at the beginning of the show, in fact \r\nthey not played in the United Kingdom for the last four years! The \r\ncrowd roared. Achilles Last Stand is aggressive and In The Evening \r\nis intense, but Stairway To Heaven sounds timid and tired ... \r\nRobert's introduction is so lackluster it is obvious he didn't want \r\nto play it. The encores are energetic and good, and Whole Lotta Love \r\nfeatures the new arrangement first tried in Copenhagen in July. A \r\nshort Heartbreaker finishes the event. After the last note, Plant \r\nsaid: &quot;All you people that have come so far. It's been kinda like \r\na blind date. Thanks for eleven years!&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71be23d138bf6cafeff879f65ea26f9562e0a3cc","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1979.08.04+Knebworth+Festival%2C+England+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71be23d138bf6cafeff879f65ea26f9562e0a3cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,190,35,209,56,191,108,175,239,248,121,246,94,162,111,149,98,224,163,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
