He adopted his mother's maiden name as a pseudonym.\n\nWhen Garrett was four years old, his father bought a violin for his older brother. The young Garrett took an interest and soon learned to play. A year later, he took part in a competition and won first prize. By the age of seven, he was playing once a week in public. He studied violin at the LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼beck Conservatoire. At the age of 12, Garrett began working with the distinguished Polish violinist Ida Haendel, often traveling to London and other European cities to meet her.\n\nHe continued his studies at the Royal College of Music in London.
