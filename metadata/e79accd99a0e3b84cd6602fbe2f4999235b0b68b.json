This is a book about the evil things that happen on computing and software projectsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½what the kinds of evil are, how they manifest themselves, and what the good guys can do about them.\n\nIn this timely report on vice at every level of software project management, industry experts Johann Rost and Robert Glass explore the seamy underbelly of software engineering. Based on the authors' original research and augmented by frank insights from other well-respected figures, The Dark Side of Software Engineering consists of anecdotes about occurrences of the practices, an analysis of research findings in the context of the anecdotes, and some suggestions on what to do about the dark side. Discussions draw from the software and information technology literature and from the management literature specific to these topics.\n\nThis is a book full of surprisesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to be read by both software and computing practitioners and academics. It addresses seven &quot;dark side matters&quot; of software project work that involve dubious management and technologist practices, including:\n\n    *\n\n      Subversion\n    *\n\n      Espionage\n    *\n\n      Lying\n    *\n\n      Disgruntled employees and sabotage\n    *\n\n      Hacking\n    *\n\n      Whistleblowing\n    *\n\n      Theft of information\n\nWritten in a quick-reading journalistic style, The Dark Side of Software Engineering goes where other management studies fear to treadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a corporate environment where schedules are fabricated, trust is betrayed, millions of dollars are lost, and there is a serious need for the kind of corrective action that this book ultimately proposes.\nAbout the Author\nJohann Rost has worked in the software industry for twenty years. He has taught at the University of Applied Science at Bingen, Germany, and at Politehnica University at Bucharest, Romania.\n\nRobert L. Glass is the author of twenty-eight books on computing subjects, including the bestselling Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering. He has written nearly one hundred articles on computing subjects and has served as a columnist for three leading publicationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Communications of the ACM (&quot;The Practical Programmer&quot;), IEEE Software (&quot;The Loyal Opposition&quot;), and Information Systems Management (&quot;Through a Glass, Darkly&quot;).\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 305 pages\n    * Publisher: Wiley-IEEE Computer Society Pr; 1 edition (February 22, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0470597178\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0470597170","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e79accd99a0e3b84cd6602fbe2f4999235b0b68b","amp;dn":"The+Dark+Side+of+Software+Engineering%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e79accd99a0e3b84cd6602fbe2f4999235b0b68b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,154,204,217,154,14,59,132,205,102,2,251,226,244,153,146,53,176,182,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
