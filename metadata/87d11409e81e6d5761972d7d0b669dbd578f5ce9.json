Microbiologist and keen amateur photographer Usha wants a garden that will be a welcoming habitat for all sorts of birds, small mammals and invertebrates which will, in turn, provide great material for her photographs. Usha has another important requirement on her wish list, as a vegetarian she wants to grow all her own fruit and veg. Usha has an eye for detail and wants to pack a lot into her small plot so the designers have their work cut out. Turning an unremarkable space that's dominated by a brutish conifer into a welcoming B&amp;B for wildlife and a relaxing, productive, beautiful garden for Usha is a tall order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 18-Jul-2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87d11409e81e6d5761972d7d0b669dbd578f5ce9","amp;dn":"Garden+Rescue+S01E06+WEB-DL.x264-JIVE.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87d11409e81e6d5761972d7d0b669dbd578f5ce9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,209,20,9,232,30,109,87,97,151,45,125,11,102,157,189,87,143,92,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
