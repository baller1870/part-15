Some claim it is home to aliens, underground tunnel systems, and nuclear facilities. Others believe that the lunar landing was filmed there. The prevalence of these rumors stems from the fact that no credible insider has ever divulged the truth about his time inside the base. Until now.\n\nAnnie Jacobsen had exclusive access to 20 men who served on the base proudly and secretly for decades and are now aged 75-92; she also had unprecedented access to 55 additional military and intelligence personnel, scientists, pilots, and engineers linked to the secret base, 32 of whom lived and worked there for extended periods. In Area 51, Jacobsen shows us what has really gone on in the Nevada desert, from testing nuclear weapons to building supersecret supersonic jets to pursuing the War on Terror. This is the first book based on interviews with eyewitnesses to Area 51 history, which makes it the seminal work on the subject. Filled with formerly classified information that has never been accurately decoded for the public, Area 51 weaves the mysterious activities of the top secret base into a gripping narrative, showing that fact is often more fantastic than fiction, especially when the distinction is almost impossible to make.\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â©2011 Annie Jacobson (P)2011 Hachette","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:107eac6cfaa97a9fe1b780bd578318a2a0dad494","amp;dn":"Area+51%3A+An+Uncensored+History+of+America%5C%27s+Top+Secret+Military","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"107eac6cfaa97a9fe1b780bd578318a2a0dad494","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,126,172,108,250,169,122,159,225,183,128,189,87,131,24,162,160,218,212,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
