The genesis of the album can\n  be traced back to the early 1970 recording sessions for Hansson's first solo album,\n  &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. As work on that album neared completion, the prolific Hansson\n  also began working on additional material that was not intended for the album.\n\n  Like its predecessor, the album was, at least partly, influenced by fairy tale and\n  fantasy themes, with the song &quot;Elidor&quot; having been directly inspired by Alan Garner's\n  1965 fantasy novel Elidor.\n\n  Bo Hansson passed away on April 23, 2010, at the age of 67.\n\n\nTracks (2002 Digital Remaster)\n  01 - Big City / Storstad\n  02 - Divided Reality / Delad Verklighet\n  03 - Elidor\n  04 - Before The Rain / FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶re Regnet\n  05 - Fylke\n  06 - Playing Downhill Into The Downs / Sluttningar(lek i nedfÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rsbacke)\n  07 - Findhorn's Song / Findhorns SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ng\n  08 - The Awakening / Uppvaknande\n  09 - Wandering Song / VandringslÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥t\n  10 - The Sun (Parallell or 90) / Solen (Parallellt eller 90 Grader)\n  11 - Excursion With Complications / Utflykt Med FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rvecklingar\n  12 - Waltz at Dawn / Vals i Gryningen\n\n\n source....: CD, released 2002\n app.......: foobar2000 v1.1.9\n codec.....: lossless flac 1.2.1, level 8.\n\n notes.....: rerip of new source.\n\n embedded front cover album art, 500x500.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:598b44226c0baba5e7a1f37e297f6260829b226f","amp;dn":"Bo+Hansson+-+Magicians+Hat+%28Remastered%29+%282002%29+%5BFLAC%5D+dussin+rer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"598b44226c0baba5e7a1f37e297f6260829b226f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,139,68,34,108,11,171,165,231,161,243,126,41,127,98,96,130,155,34,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
