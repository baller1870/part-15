In particular, the book explores how women initiate agency and espouse liberation and empowerment through something as seemingly problematic as pole classes.\n\n===================================================================================\nReview\n'This book pays much needed attention to a fascinating phenomenon emerging from striptease culture and the mainstreaming of sex...Holland's cutting-edge ethnography illuminates brilliantly the complexities of feminized and embodied empowerment swirling around these poles, as women from all walks of life explore this new form of exercise and self-expression. 'Poler' is now a new word in my vocabulary!' - Catherine M. Roach, Associate Professor, New College, University of Alabama, USA\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nSAMANTHA HOLLAND is Research Fellow, Leeds Metropolitan University, UK.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a4f6dcb4771b1558383f235e72ad64f76a7b9d5","amp;dn":"Samantha+Holland+-+Pole+Dancing%2C+Empowerment+and+Embodiment+%5B201","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a4f6dcb4771b1558383f235e72ad64f76a7b9d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,79,109,203,71,113,177,85,131,131,242,53,231,42,214,79,118,167,185,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
