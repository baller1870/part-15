Outside our 50 states, AT40 is heard in fifteen foreign cities circling the earth, and most of the rest of the planet served by over 350 American Forces radio outlets. And our countdown continues.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nSuperstar Melanie has three hits in this countdown: &quot;Nickel Song&quot; at number 36, &quot;Ring The Living Bell&quot; at number 34, and &quot;Brand New Key&quot; at number 24.\n\nThere is a hit by the singing star whose background singers include Darlene Love and former members of The Crystals and The Ronettes as well as former Diamonds lead singer David Somerville and a lead guitar track by Duane Eddy.\n\nThere is a group who earned five million dollars in 1970, and topped that in 1971, but never made it into the top 10, and just here has only their second top 40 hit.\n\nA listener wants to know, &quot;What record debuted the highest on the chart without ever getting any higher than its debut position?&quot; Casey says it happened in 1957 with a song by The Mellotones that debuted in the hot 100 at number 27. It was the only chart single they ever had.\n\nFormer Buffalo Springfield member Neil Young has the biggest mover in the countdown, &quot;Heart Of Gold&quot; at number 13.\n\nA listener asks this question; &quot;What was the biggest number of non-American recording artists in the top 10 at any one time and who were they?&quot; Casey says nine and that one act accounted for two of the hits.\n\n40:    Kiss An Angel Good Morning - Charley Pride\n39:    You Want It, You Got It - The Detroit Emeralds\n38:    Talking Loud And Saying Nothing - James Brown        \n37:    Feelin' Alright - Joe Cocker     \n36:    Nickel Song - Melanie     \n35:    Runnin' Away - Sly &amp; The Family Stone    \n34:    Ring The Living Bell - Melanie\n33:    We've Got To Get It On Again - Addrisi Brothers\n32:    Rock And Roll Lullaby - B.J.
