Making a change from Kawase's former films, which are all set in her native Nara, Nanayo was shot in a poetic village in Thailand. The movie details the human drama that unfolds as different people of different nationalities happen to come together under one roof in a house in the middle of a forest. Lacking a common language, the art of traditional Thai massage becomes the tool they use to communicate. Removed from the speed of modern life, they form a strange but happy pseudo family. Kawase works for the first time with a multi-national cast and staff, including Gregoire Colin (seen in Claire Denis' &quot;Beau Travail&quot; and Erick Zonca's &quot;La vie revee des anges&quot;) and favorite's Rivette and Truffaut Caroline Champetier as a director of photography. Almost nothing is ever revealed about anyone's backgrounds but as usual in Naomi Kawase's movies, nature, atmosphere and landscape have much to say.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1039790/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1039790/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://asianwiki.com/Naomi_Kawase&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://asianwiki.com/Naomi_Kawase&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n---\n\nFormat: DVD ISO\nVideo codec: MPEG2 / 720x384 / 23.976 fps / 16:9\nAudio codec: AC3 @ 448 Kbps / 48 KHz / 6 channels\nDuration: 1h 29m 27s\nLanguage: a mix of Thai-English-French-Japanese\nSubtitles: Japanese + English + Russian\nFile size: 3.97 Gb\n\n---\n\nSHARING IS CARING","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:135ac372347d84793aab6312404521b6c0117aaa","amp;dn":"Nanayomachi+%5BNaomi+Kawase%2C+2008%5D+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"135ac372347d84793aab6312404521b6c0117aaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,90,195,114,52,125,132,121,58,171,99,18,64,69,33,182,192,17,122,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
