The team made its debut in The Avengers #1 (September 1963), and was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist / co-plotter Jack Kirby.\n\nLabeled &quot;Earth's Mightiest Heroes&quot;, the Avengers originally consisted of Ant-Man (Dr. Hank Pym), Wasp (Janet Van Dyne), Thor, Iron Man (Tony Stark), and the Hulk (at a time when the Hulk was more intelligent). The original Captain America was discovered by the team in issue #4, trapped in ice, and he joined the group when they revived him. The rotating roster has become a hallmark of the team, although one theme remains consistent: the Avengers fight &quot;the foes no single superhero can withstand.&quot; The team is famous for its battle cry &quot;Avengers Assemble!&quot; The team has featured humans, mutants, robots, gods, aliens, supernatural beings, and even former villains. An animated television series The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes premiered on October 20, 2010. A feature film is set for May 4, 2012.\n\nNote: This does not include limited series and one-shots.\n\nAll files sourced from the Complete Marvel Chronology Project, courtesy of PeteThePIPster.\n\nAll files are named with year and month of release, if you put my packs in the same folder you will automatically have a chronological collection.\n\nFormat: CBR/CBZ\nPublisher: Marvel\nRelease Dates: Nov 1996 - Jul 2011\nIssues:\nAvengers v2 #1-#13\nAvengers v3 #1-#84, #500-#503, #0, Annuals 1998-2001, Finale\nAvengers v4 #1-#13\nNew Avengers v1 #1-#64, Annuals #1-#3, Finale\nNew Avengers v2 #1-#12\nThe Avengers: United They Stand #1-#7\nYoung Avengers #1-#12, Special #1\nAvengers: The Initiative #1-#35, Annual #1, Special #1\nMighty Avengers #1-#36\nDark Avengers #1-#16, Annual #1\nSecret Avengers #1-#13\nAvengers Academy #1-#14, Giant Size\n\nCheck my previous torrents for Avengers v1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad81ebbf7522e695ffdc709aa79679147cec9449","amp;dn":"Avengers+1996-11+-+2011-07+%5Bdrknark%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad81ebbf7522e695ffdc709aa79679147cec9449","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,129,235,191,117,34,230,149,255,220,112,154,167,150,121,20,124,236,148,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
