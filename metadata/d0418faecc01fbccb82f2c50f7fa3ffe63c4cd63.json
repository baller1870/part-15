Unlike the energy crisis of the 1970s, however, there is a lurking fear that now the times are different and the crisis may not easily be resolved.\n\nThe Long Descent examines the basis of such fear through three core themes:\n\n*Industrial society is following the same well-worn path that has led other civilizations into decline, a path involving a much slower and more complex transformation than the sudden catastrophes imagined by so many social critics today.\n*The roots of the crisis lie in the cultural stories that shape the way we understand the world. Since problems cannot be solved with the same thinking that created them, these ways of thinking need to be replaced with others better suited to the needs of our time.\n*It is too late for massive programs for top-down change; the change must come from individuals.\n\nHope exists in actions that range from taking up a handicraft or adopting an Ã¢â‚¬Å“obsoleteÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ technology, through planting an organic vegetable garden, taking charge of your own health care or spirituality, and building community.\n\nFocusing eloquently on constructive adaptation to massive change, this book will have wide appeal.\n\nJohn Michael Greer is a certified Master Conserver, organic gardener, and scholar of ecological history. The current Grand Archdruid of the Ancient Order of Druids in America (AODA), his widely-cited blog, The Archdruid Reportdeals with peak oil, among other issues. He lives in Ashland, Oregon.\n\n288 pages\nPublisher: New Society Publishers; 1St Edition edition (September 1, 2008)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0865716099\nISBN-13: 978-0865716094","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0418faecc01fbccb82f2c50f7fa3ffe63c4cd63","amp;dn":"The+Long+Descent+%282008%29+by+John+Michael+Greer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0418faecc01fbccb82f2c50f7fa3ffe63c4cd63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,65,143,174,204,1,251,204,184,47,44,80,247,250,63,254,99,196,205,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
