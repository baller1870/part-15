It was designed to fit into almost everyone's taste. There's not a `wrong' song on it. Why?...well, just because every song on this compilation is a hit. Long time fans will condemn it to perdition, they will tell you that THE BEST OF 1980-1990 and 1990-2000 are better collections...and it's true! but that's not a reason to say that this album is a bad thing. \n\nIt opens with &quot;I Will Follow&quot; and then the chain of hits is unleashed: &quot;Beautiful Day&quot;, &quot;With Or Without You&quot;...etc. The album offers two new songs. Both of them could've been better, I think neither the collaboration with Green Day or &quot;Window In The Skies&quot; are going to become U2's classics. \n\nWith this recent U218 celebration, there's a lot of stuff being offered. A single CD, a CD plus a DVD, a DVD...but the best of them all is the book &quot;U2 BY U2&quot;...that was designed for the long time fans!. \n\nBut U218 The Singles is a good choice por those who want to have all the best known songs in one record. The booklet has the lyrics and the packaging is a nice one. So if you're looking for that good gift for these Christmas, this one is going to make it for you. \n\nby Blackcuervo\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Beautiful Day.wma                                      \n02 - I Still Haven`t Found What I`m Looking For.wma         \n03 - Pride (In The Name Of Love).wma                        \n04 - With Or Without You.wma                                \n05 - Vertigo.wma                                            \n06 - New Year's Day.wma                                     \n07 - Mysterious Ways.wma                                    \n08 - Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of.wma             \n09 - Where The Streets Have No Name.wma                     \n10 - Sweetest Thing.wma                                     \n11 - Sunday Bloody Sunday.wma                               \n12 - One.wma                                                \n13 - Desire.wma                                             \n14 - Walk On.wma                                            \n15 - Elevation.wma                                          \n16 - Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own.wma            \n17 - The Saints Are Coming (With Green Day).wma             \n18 - Window In The Skies.wma   \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62590aeeb2e26940f5db8fa6321034c9a9578cc5","amp;dn":"U2+-+18+Singles+%282006%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62590aeeb2e26940f5db8fa6321034c9a9578cc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,89,10,238,178,226,105,64,245,219,143,166,50,16,52,201,169,87,140,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
