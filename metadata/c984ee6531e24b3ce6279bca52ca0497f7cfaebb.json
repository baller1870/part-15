Stints on the gospel circuit preceded Benton's first secular session for Okeh in 1953, but his career didn't begin to take off until he teamed with writer/producer Clyde Otis. Benton co-wrote and sang hundreds of demos for other artists before frequent collaborator Otis signed his friend to Mercury; together they pioneered a lush, violin-studded variation on the standard R&amp;B sound, which beautifully showcased Benton's intimate vocals.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/brook-benton-p3662/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/brook-benton-p3662/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Stephen Thomas Erlewine):\n\nTwelve years after they released Anthology, arguably the definitive career-spanning Brook Benton collection, Rhino adapted the compilation for CD, releasing Endlessly: The Best of Brook Benton. Endlessly features three tracks less than Anthology, yet it doesn't suffer -- it remains a nearly flawless overview of Benton's career, featuring all of his big hits plus many terrific lesser-known singles. Every one of his great singles -- from &quot;It's Just a Matter of Time,&quot; &quot;Baby (You've Got What It Takes),&quot; and &quot;Kiddio&quot; to &quot;The Boll Weevil Song&quot; and &quot;Rainy Night in Georgia&quot; -- are here, in a more concise and accessible form than Mercury's double-disc 40 Greatest Hits. That double-disc set remains an ideal choice for collectors, but less dedicated fans will find Endlessly to be essential.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r351825&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r351825&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000006OJ7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000006OJ7&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
