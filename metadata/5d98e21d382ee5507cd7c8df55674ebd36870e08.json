One night, at a barn dance, he gets a little drunk and rather than going with the hired whores, gives into his desires and sexual relations with an unnamed man. The guilt causes him to run away, hide in the woods and eventually confess everything to Bobbi Lee who doesn't want to believe him only because she was enjoying the forbidden nature of their love.\n\n Running Time: 1 Hours 46 Minutes\n Video Size : 512 x 384","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d98e21d382ee5507cd7c8df55674ebd36870e08","amp;dn":"Ode.to.Billy.Joe.1976.VHS-Transfer.XviD.by.Industrialized","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d98e21d382ee5507cd7c8df55674ebd36870e08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,152,226,29,56,46,229,80,124,215,200,223,85,103,78,189,54,135,14,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
