The band was formed in 2002 and their first EP, VÃƒÂªn, was released in 2003. VÃƒÂªn was a studio project of Glanzmann's, but its success led to the recruitment of a full band. They describe themselves as &quot;The new wave of folk metal&quot;. The band then released a full-length album, Spirit, in June 2006. In November 2007, Eluveitie was signed by Nuclear Blast.The first product of the collaboration, Slania, was released in February 2008. The album peaked at number 35 in the Swiss charts and number 72 in the German charts.\n\nEluveitie use traditional instruments amidst guitars and harsh vocals. The lyrics are often in the extinct ancient language Gaulish. The name of the band comes from graffiti on a vessel from Mantua (ca. 300 BC).[10] The inscription in Etruscan letters reads eluveitie, which has been interpreted as the Etruscan form of the Celtic (h)elvetios (Ã¢â‚¬Å“the HelvetianÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), presumably referring to a man of Helvetian descent living in Mantua.\n\nContents\n\n    1 History\n        1.1 Formation and Twilight Records contract (2002 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2007)\n        1.2 Nuclear Blast contract and Slania (2006 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2012)\n        1.3 Helvetios and Origins (2012 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ present)\n    2 Characteristics\n    3 Members\n        3.1 Current members\n        3.2 Guest musicians\n        3.3 Former members\n        3.4 Timeline\n   \n\nHistory\nEluveitie at Cernunnos Fest\nFormation and Twilight Records contract (2002 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2007)\n\nThe band was founded in the winter of 2002 by Christian &quot;Chrigel&quot; Glanzmann as a studio project featuring different people on different tracks. October the following year saw the publication of the MCD VÃƒÂªn (Helvetian Gaulish for &quot;wild joy&quot;). After Chrigel decided to make Eluveitie a real band instead of a studio project, he assembled nine other musicians, making it a full ten-piece band.\n\nShortly afterwards, the group performed its first shows, one including the Swiss metal festival Elements of Rock, and Eluveitie signed a contract with the Dutch record label Fear Dark, which released a re-recorded VÃƒÂªn in 2004. Other live performances were played, such as on some events of &quot;Fear Dark Festivals&quot;, and even as support for the established international paganÃ¢â‚¬â€œfolk metal acts such as Korpiklaani and Cruachan. At this point, the band became full-time, and 7 of the 10 members left for various reasons, leaving Chrigel Glanzmann, Sevan Kirder and Meri TadiÃ„â€¡ to carry on with new members. They recruited six others, including Sevan Kirder's brother Rafi to play bass, making Eluveitie a nine-piece band.\n\nA limited edition tribute album to the GermanÃ¢â‚¬â€œIcelandic band Falkenbach was published in 2006 to celebrate their 15th anniversary. The album included Eluveitie's cover song &quot;Vanadis&quot;.\n\nAt the beginning of 2006, there was another change in the band's line-up. Sarah Kiener was replaced by Anna Murphy to play hurdy gurdy and Linda Suter was removed, trimming the band down to eight members.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2006, the album entitled Spirit was published on Fear Dark, and in September that same year Eluveitie toured Europe with the German band Odroerir. At the end of 2006, Eluveitie signed a new recording contract with the German label Twilight Records. In early 2007, they played at RagnarÃƒÂ¶k Festival.\nNuclear Blast contract and Slania (2006 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2012)\n\nIn November 2007, Eluveitie signed a contract with label Nuclear Blast. The new studio album Slania (a girl's name that Chrigel saw on a 2500-year-old tombstone[6][13]) was released on February 15, 2008.\n\nOn June 4, 2008, brothers Rafi and Sevan Kirder (bassist and bagpipe player, respectively) announced on their MySpace pages that they would leave Eluveitie following their concert at the Metal Camp Open Air in Slovenia on July 8, 2008.[14]\n\nEluveitie's next project, Evocation, was announced in 2008. The first part of the album, Evocation I: The Arcane Dominion, was released in April 2009.[6] The band released an official special edition of this new album as Slania/Evocation I Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Arcane Metal Hammer Edition on the May Edition from the Metal Hammer, the magazine was released on 15 April 2009 with eight songs from Evocation I: The Arcane Dominion and five from Slania.Got a feeling we will be hearing more from these guys.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d125e1c29f949e5310fd941f95eaebc6ee405da5","amp;dn":"Eluvetie-Origins+192k+++MP3++ak2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d125e1c29f949e5310fd941f95eaebc6ee405da5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,37,225,194,159,148,158,83,16,253,148,31,149,234,235,198,238,64,93,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
