And in the dying days\nof the great Byzantine Empire - that last vestige of\nwhat had once been Imperial Rome - her value as the\nemperor's daughter was priceless. Three men claimed\nher as wife. Orkhan, the powerful Ottoman sultan; the\ndashing pirate Alexander, lord of Mesembria; and\nPrince Murad, to whom Adora's heart truly belonged.\nIn a grand epic that sweeps the reader from the golden\npalaces of fourteenth-century Byzantium to the blazing\nsensuality of the sultan's harem, Adora was a woman\nwho firmly controlled her own destiny because she and\nMurad were meant only for each other. And together\ntheir passions would forge an empire. Adora! Her name\nwas the secret of all love. Publisher Note: This story\nwas previously published elsewhere, 1980-1995.\n\n\nAdora\nby Bertrice Small\nLanguage: EN\nPages: EPUB 711","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb741ad9a48f7f28eec18ff2b870d195fb0bee29","amp;dn":"Adora+by+Bertrice+Small%2C+Jose+Ferrer+EPUB+EN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb741ad9a48f7f28eec18ff2b870d195fb0bee29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,116,26,217,164,143,127,40,238,193,143,242,184,112,209,149,251,11,238,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
