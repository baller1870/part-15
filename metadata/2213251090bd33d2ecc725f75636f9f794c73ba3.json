Chaney, a down-on-his-luck loner, hops a freight train to New Orleans where, on the seedier side of town, he tries to make some quick money the only way he knows how ?with his fists. Chaney approaches a hustler named Speed and convinces him that he can win big money for them both. Chaney wins a few tough illegal fights bare-fisted but Speed?s carelessness with his money and indebtedness to a gang of thugs forces Chaney to fight one last match with Street, a huge monster of a man. The final bout is a no-holds-barred, knock-down, drag-out fight that Bronson fans will love.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2213251090bd33d2ecc725f75636f9f794c73ba3","amp;dn":"Hard+Times+%28Charles+Bronson%29+Multi+Languajes+%2F+Multi+sub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2213251090bd33d2ecc725f75636f9f794c73ba3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,19,37,16,144,189,51,210,236,199,37,247,86,54,249,247,148,199,59,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
