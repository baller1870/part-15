Ongoing adventures feature simultaneous ship-to-ship and boarding combat in space. Players work together as a starship crew aboard a ship of their own design facing referee-controlled forces. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll track the heroes' positions on the starship layouts and the starshipsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ positions on the space map. The action in Battlestations is character driven. If you want the ship to turn, speed up, or launch a missile or blast the enemy ship, a hero has to take an action to make it so.\n\nThis is a scan of the manual, OCR'd and with a deep Table of Contents for your pleasure. If the designers ever officially release the PDF version of this manual (their site has said &quot;coming soon&quot; for the PDF manual for well over a year now) I recommend folks buy their PDF.\n\nBuy the box set if you enjoy this game!\n\nI've also included a set of all of what you'll need to play in PNG format, with transparency and all that; plus a MapTool campaign file and other resources if you want to play Battlestations in MapTool. (See rptools.net for details on MapTool.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd1b31d7a7e88314f1bc26d2a3687843db1fd12f","amp;dn":"Battlestations+Field+Guide+v1.1+%28Board%2FRPG+game%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd1b31d7a7e88314f1bc26d2a3687843db1fd12f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,27,49,215,167,232,131,20,241,188,38,210,163,104,120,67,219,31,209,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
