Jussim &amp; Clark R. McCauley.pdf\n\nSocial psychology has been dominated over the past 20 years with a focus on error and bias in social perception. By psychologists and lay people alike, stereotypes are assumed to be bad and inaccurate. The idea that stereotypes may have some degree of accuracy has been seen as anathema, and those raising the question of stereotype accuracy have been viewed as racist, sexist, or worse.\n\nStereotype Accuracy breaks this taboo by presenting research related to stereotype accuracy, arguing that understanding stereotype accuracy is crucial to both social psychology and to its applications (e.g., to improving intergroup relations). The goals of this volume are to reduce commonplace errors in modern social science by challenging the off-hand and undocumented claims appearing in the scholarly literature that stereotypes are &quot;typically&quot; inaccurate, resistant to change, overgeneralized, exaggerated, and generally destructive. \n\n330 pages\nSeries: APA Science\nPublisher: American Psychological Association (APA); 1st edition (January 1995)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1557983070\nISBN-13: 978-1557983077","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d488a2dc9993b48ddb2798c84f1dddf04abff4b","amp;dn":"Stereotype+Accuracy+%281995%29+edited+by+Yueh-Ting+Lee%2C+et+al.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d488a2dc9993b48ddb2798c84f1dddf04abff4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,72,138,45,201,153,59,72,221,178,121,140,132,241,221,223,4,171,255,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
