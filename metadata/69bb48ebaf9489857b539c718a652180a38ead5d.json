Once seen as an Ã¢â‚¬ËœorientalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ or Ã¢â‚¬ËœeasternÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ phenomenon, Orthodox Christianity is now much more widely dispersed, and in many parts of the modern world one need not go far to find an Orthodox community at worship. This collection offers a compelling overview of the Orthodox world, covering the main regional traditions of Orthodox Christianity and the ways in which they have become global. The contributors are drawn from the Orthodox community worldwide and explore a rich selection of key figures and themes. The book provides an innovative and illuminating approach to the subject, ideal for students and scholars alike.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69bb48ebaf9489857b539c718a652180a38ead5d","amp;dn":"The+Orthodox+Christian+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69bb48ebaf9489857b539c718a652180a38ead5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,187,72,235,175,148,137,133,123,83,156,113,138,101,33,128,163,142,173,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
