She now holds dual Russian and Austrian citizenship and currently resides in Vienna. She has been nicknamed &quot;La Bellissima&quot; by fans.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Netrebko&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Netrebko&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.annanetrebko.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.annanetrebko.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nReview\nWhat makes Anna Netrebko more than just the next Russian soprano? Is it her as direct but not as quite so refined technique, her less restrained but much more effective interpretations, and her intensely expressive but always under control tone? Or is it her distinctively non-Russian vibrato -- leaner, cleaner, and with a much tighter focus but just as much power? One has to listen to Netrebko's Russian Album and judge for one's self. Listen to her tenderly touching Arioso from Tchaikovsky's Iolanta, her brilliantly colorful arias from Rimsky-Korsakov's Snow Maiden, her passionately despairing songs from\nRachmaninov's Russian years -- especially her inconsolable &quot;Oh, Do Not Sing Me Those Sad Songs&quot; -- and finally her utterly enchanting and deeply affecting &quot;Letter Scene&quot; from Eugene Onegin in which Tchaikovsky's Tatyana grows from a girl into a woman right before our ears. While in the past Netrebko has delivered terrific recordings -- her Violetta in La Traviata was absolutely riveting -- this disc seems to cut closer to the heart of the singer and her sympathetic understanding of the style, the music, and the idiom makes the Russian Album perhaps the her best and most characteristic calling card. Deutsche Grammophon's sound puts Netrebko center stage. Lamentably, it leaves Valery Gergiev and the Orchestra of the Mariinsky Theater in the pit.\nJames Leonard AMG &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/russian-album-w146961/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/russian-album-w146961/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\nZlata Bulycheva, mwzzo-soprano, Beauteous Spring, Sanya\nDmitry Voropaev, tenor, Amatol, tsar\nAlexander Morozoc, bass-baritone, Count Rostov, Misgir\nIlya Bannik, bass, Frost\n\nChorus of the Mariinsky Theatre, chorus master:Andrei Petrenko\nOrchestra of the Mariinsky Theatre conducted by Valery Gergiev \n\nAnna Netrebko &amp; Valery Gergiev: Orchestra of the Mariinsky Theatre - Russian Album\n2006\n\n01  Anna Netrebko &amp; Valery Gergiev: Orchestra of the Mariinsky Theatre - Tchaikovsky, Iolanta (Arioso No.1)\n02  Anna Netrebko &amp; Valery Gergiev: Orchestra of the Mariinsky Theatre - Rachmaninov, Song Op.21 No.7\n03  Anna Netrebko &amp; Valery Gergiev: Orchestra of the Mariinsky Theatre - Rachmaninov, Song Op.4 No.4\n04  Anna Netrebko &amp; Valery Gergiev: Orchestra of the Mariinsky Theatre - Rimsky-Korsakov: The Tale Of Tsar Saltan - Act 4: Aria\n05  Anna Netrebko, Zlata Bulycheva, Ilya Bannik, Valery Gergiev: Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra - Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, The Snow Maiden (Scene and Aria from Prologue)\n06  Anna Netrebko, Dimitry Voropaev, Vladimir Moroz, Valery Gergiev: Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra, Chorus of the Marinsky Theatre, chorus master: Nikolai Kornev - Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, The Snow Maiden (Finale from Act IV)\n07  Anna Netrebko &amp; Valery Gergiev: Orchestra of the Mariinsky Theatre - Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, The Tsar's Bride (Scene and Aria from Act IV)\n08  Anna Netrebko &amp; Valery Gergiev: Orchestra of the Mariinsky Theatre - Tchaikovsky, Romance Op.38 No.6\n09  Anna Netrebko &amp; Valery Gergiev: Orchestra of the Mariinsky Theatre - Michail Glinka, A Life for the Tsar (Cavatina and Rondo from Act I)\n10  Anna Netrebko, Zlata Bulycheva, Dmitry Voropaev, Alexander Morozov, Valery Gergiev: Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra - Sergei Prokofiev, War and Peace (Excerpt from Scene IV)\n11  Anna Netrebko &amp; Valery Gergiev: Orchestra of the Mariinsky Theatre - Rachmaninov, Francesca da Rimini (Excerpt from Tableau II)\n12  Anna Netrebko &amp; Valery Gergiev: Orchestra of the Mariinsky Theatre - Tchaikovsky, Eugene Onegin (Letter Scene from Act I)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/russian-album-w146961&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/russian-album-w146961&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.deutschegrammophon.com/cat/single?sort=newest_rec&amp;PRODUCT_NR=4776151&amp;SearchString=anna+netrebko+russian+album&amp;UNBUYABLE=1&amp;per_page=50&amp;flow_per_page=50&amp;presentation=flow&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.deutschegrammophon.com/cat/single?sort=newest_rec&amp;PRODUCT_NR=4776151&amp;SearchString=anna+netrebko+russian+album&amp;UNBUYABLE=1&amp;per_page=50&amp;flow_per_page=50&amp;presentation=flow&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dd4a92af7e73f33e0593a9a27e0b30fd3abbb59","amp;dn":"Anna+Netrebko+-+Russian+Album+%282006%29++FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dd4a92af7e73f33e0593a9a27e0b30fd3abbb59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,212,169,42,247,231,63,51,224,89,58,154,39,224,179,15,211,171,187,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
