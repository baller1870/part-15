Produced by Rick Rubin, the album sees Rockworking with a completely new backing band put together by Rubin and featuring Matt Sweeney, David Hidalgo and Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith. Described as an organic sounding rock and blues album Rock has managed to keep alive his trademark mix of Southern Rock and Hip Hop.\n[IMG]http://i896.photobucket.com/albums/ac169/pbf99/tr.gif[/IMG]\n   1.
