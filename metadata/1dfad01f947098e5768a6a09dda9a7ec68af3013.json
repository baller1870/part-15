Written by an experienced child psychologist, The Asperger's Answer Book covers such topics as:\n\n--Is it autism or is it Asperger's?\n--Getting your child evaluated\n--Emotional intelligence\n--Routines and rituals\n--Motor skills\n--Sensory sensitivity\n--Growing up with Asperger's Syndrome\n\nWritten in an easy-to-read Q&amp;A format, The Asperger's Answer Book helps parents understand and accept their child's illness and develop a plan for success.\n\nExcerpt:\nWhat is Asperger's Disorder?\nAsperger's Disorder, which will be referred to as AD throughout this book, is considered a pervasive developmental disorder. This means it causes significant problems in many areas of the child's development, including socialization, communication, behavior, thinking, and activities.\nChildren, teens, and adults who have AD have significant problems with:\n\n1. Socializing with others\n2. Thinking\n3. Emotions\n4. Intense preoccupation with one or two topics\n5. Repetitive routines, behaviors, and movements\n6. Play\n7. Speech and language\n8. Motor skills\n9. Sensitivity to sensations of sound, light, or touch\n\nIndividuals with AD are different from people with other pervasive developmental disorders in that they do not have significant delays in language, cognitive development, or self-help skills.\nSymptoms of AD are seen in every setting, including at home, in the classroom, on the playground, and in after-school and extracurricular activities. Virtually every area of the AD child's life is affected.
