He then talks about Jennifer Lawrence speaking out on her nudes being leaked, privacy being violated thanks to the cloud, and we learn that Jill Nicolini is preggersÃ¢â‚¬Â¦maybe. Ant shows us a new clip of a sleepy Mike Francesa, a video of a window smash and tasering, and one of a celebrating flasher. We listen to a TMZ tape of Stephen Collins admitting to kid touching, Ant tells us a story about calling into the Howard Stern show, and takes some fantastic (not) phone calls. We watch Jerry SeinfeldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Clio Award speech, see how crystal meth makes certain people act, and hear about a shocking past sexcapade from KtC. Bobo then joins Ant briefly to hear heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be rebooked and the show comes to a close hearing about an Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ebola zombieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Rock the Vote.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5291cbc0e4493e4781e5c8373c8af90cd9f2ff9","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-10-07","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5291cbc0e4493e4781e5c8373c8af90cd9f2ff9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,41,28,188,14,68,147,228,120,30,92,131,115,200,175,144,205,159,47,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
