With that in mind, director Grant Gee has created something truly special with Meeting People Is Easy, a movie revealing that, critically acclaimed or not, the life and times of a rock supergroup can be pretty boring. Rather than focus on Radiohead's songs and concert footage, Gee takes us behind the scenes with his handheld super-8 camera to show us grainy images of the multiple interviews, backstage boredom, and all-around monotony that followed the British group in the wake of their critically acclaimed third album. With a postmodern edge that perfectly suits the band--text from interviews scrolls across the screen, half the camera angles have the appearance of being hidden--and carte blanche to follow the group everywhere they go, Gee's movie makes for fascinating (and anything but boring) viewing. You see, Radiohead's rock &amp; roll lifestyle is one for the 21st century: no TVs thrown out of windows, no M&amp;M candies separated by colors, just plenty of scheduled press interviews, constant touring, and the occasional rehearsal. During the shoot of their &quot;No Surprises&quot; video, Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke puts himself through pure agony as he tries to keep his head under water long enough for an extended camera take. (&quot;No Surprises,&quot; it should be noted, was also directed by Gee). It's symbolic of the entire film: the band is jumping through hoops while trying (desperately) to maintain their composure. During one of the many press-conference sound bites heard in the movie, Yorke hypothesizes, &quot;OK Computer is about everything being out of control.&quot; By the probing looks of Meeting People, that's a fair assumption. --Jason Verlinde\n\nSUBTITULOS, LEGENDAS, ESPAÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ËœOL, PORTUGUÃƒÆ’Ã…Â S\n\n\nCast\n\nThom Yorke \t... \tHimself (as Radiohead)\nJonny Greenwood ...
