(Wes Long) \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“AuraÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a concept album, produced by Danish composer / trumpeter Palle Mikkelborg, recorded in Copenhagen in 1985, released in 1989.\nIt successfully blends MilesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ electric style with the feel of his earlier big-band works with Gil Evans.\nThe main theme consists of 10 notes, yielded by the letters &quot;M-I-L-E-S-D-A-V-I-S&quot;. It is introduced at the beginning over a sustained chord of these same notes. The following 9 movements of the suite represent the colours Mikkelborg sees in Miles's aura.\nEmploying a full orchestra, Aura's sections are named for the color spectrum, with the addition of Ã¢â‚¬Å“whiteÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and &quot;electric red.&quot; The music is an amalgam of classical impressionism, European new music, jazz, rock, electronic, and other genres.\nWith Davis added, soloing in his trademark muted, rounded warmth, the music becomes almost breathtaking. Pure magic from beginning to end.\n\n\nMiles Davis\n\n CD / 2000 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Intro \n\n2. White \n\n\n8. Electric Red \n\n9. Indigo\n\n10.
