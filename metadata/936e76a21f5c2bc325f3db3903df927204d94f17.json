Hearkening back to a somewhat simpler, more basic British Invasion approach as psychedelia began to explode in the late '60s, the group also reached the Top Five with their flower-power ballad &quot;Love Is All Around&quot; in 1968. While more popular in their native England than the U.S., the band also fashioned memorable, insistently riffing hit singles like &quot;With a Girl Like You,&quot; &quot;Night of the Long Grass,&quot; and the notoriously salacious &quot;I Can't Control Myself&quot; between 1966 and 1968. Paced by Reg Presley's lusting vocals, the group -- which composed most of their own material -- could crunch with the best of them, but were also capable of quite a bit more range and melodic invention than they've been given credit for.\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:difpxqr5ldde~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:difpxqr5ldde~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThere is no review for this album at AllMusic.
