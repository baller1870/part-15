On his birthdayÃ¢â‚¬â€or rather, the day the nuns designate as his birthdayÃ¢â‚¬â€William and the other orphans are taken to the historical Moore Theatre, where William glimpses an actress on the silver screen who goes by the name of Willow Frost. Struck by her features, William is convinced that the movie star is his mother, Liu Song.\n\nDetermined to find Willow, and prove his mother is still alive, William escapes from Sacred Heart with his friend Charlotte. The pair navigates the streets of Seattle, where they must not only survive, but confront the mysteries of WilliamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past and his connection to the exotic film star. The story of Willow Frost, however, is far more complicated than the Hollywood fantasy William sees onscreen.\n\nShifting between the Great Depression and the 1920s, Songs of Willow Frost takes readers on an emotional journey of discovery. Jamie FordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sweeping book will resonate with anyone who has ever longed for the comforts of family and a place to call home.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa64ebd6c8333888962cf8a0345a238fbde97d64","amp;dn":"Songs+of+Willow+Frost+-+Jamie+Ford.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa64ebd6c8333888962cf8a0345a238fbde97d64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,100,235,214,200,51,56,136,150,44,248,160,52,90,35,143,189,233,125,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
